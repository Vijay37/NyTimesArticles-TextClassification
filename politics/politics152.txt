Trump casts a long shadow over this once-thriving community, where steel mills, furnaces, bridge works, brickyards, textile plants and boiler shops provided steady jobs for the city’s working and middle classes.In 1950, most of those jobs involved making things: steel, auto parts, castings, sewer pipes, coatings, textiles and pies. Today, only two of Pottstown’s top employers make things: Dana Corp. and Precision Polymer. The Pottstown Hospital Center and the Pottstown School District are by far the largest employers, with 978 and 520 workers respectively.Pottstown, whose retired and laid-off steelworkers, machinists and tool and die makers have deep roots in the Democratic Party, is just the kind of place where Trump hopes his plan to “Make America Great Again” will resonate and move voters to the Republican column.My interviews this week with Pottstown voters in working and middle class white neighborhoods showed almost no support for Trump among women, but steady support among men.“I like him because he is to the point, and it’s time for a change, I think he’s got the oomph to rattle some cages,” John Keyser, a nonunion employee at Universal Concrete Products Corporation, said. Universal Concrete is one of the few manufacturing facilities left in the area. Keyser told me that he usually votes for Democrats and thinks that Bill Clinton was “one of the greatest and best presidents we ever had.” But this year he supports Trump:I’d rather have somebody who does get angry and has feelings than what we have had with politicians who don’t care either way. I like the emotional involvement.In a number of cases, local support for Trump among white men was based as much on their animosity to Hillary Clinton as it was on their faith in Trump.“I’d vote for the devil before I would ever vote for that woman,” said a man in his 60s who identified himself only as Keith. In a phrase repeated by at least three others, Keith said that Hillary Clinton “belongs in jail.”Stacey Weinstein, a 53-year-old psychiatric social worker, reflected the opposite side of the coin: she distrusts Clinton, but sees Trump as by far the worse choice.“I’m not terribly enthusiastic about her because I think she has done some very underhanded things,” Weinstein said, but “Donald Trump is a misogynist, and I don’t like misogynists.”What stood out in the interviews I conducted on June 13 here and in an upscale development in East Goshen, 24 miles south of Pottstown, was that the Trump supporters were male, with one exception; Clinton backers were decisively (but not exclusively) women.David, a computer programmer in Pottstown with strong libertarian leanings who didn’t want to give his last name, said he is “not for Hillary for sure. The history of the Clintons is about corruption.”Seemingly unaware of Trump’s opposition to free trade agreements, David said that he believes that “International trade is good, local trade is good, all trade is good.”What makes the Trump campaign especially interesting in Pennsylvania is that Trump is going to be a crucial factor in the Toomey-McGinty Senate race.But for Toomey it is a major decision because of two conflicting strategic calculations.On the other, Trump threatens to provoke a level of animosity among voters in the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia regions, both Democratic bastions, that could swamp all statewide Republican candidates.Initially, Toomey appeared prepared to stand up to Trump in a gamble that the presumptive presidential nominee’s Pennsylvania voters will cast down-the-line Republican ballots no matter what.Trump was not my first, second, or third choice. I object to much in his manner and his policies. His vulgarity, particularly toward women, is appalling. His lack of appreciation for Constitutional limits on executive powers is deeply concerning. I disagree with his proposals to ban Muslims, to give government more eminent domain powers, to be neutral between Israel and its enemies, and several others. In short, I find his candidacy highly problematic.In order to win his support, Toomey wrote:It is up to Trump to make the case for himself in a way that reassures the millions of Republicans and non-Republicans who have grave doubts about him.Since then, however, even as Trump has offered no such reassurance — just the opposite, in fact — Toomey appears to be wavering.I’m hoping that Donald Trump can say and do the things that will make me comfortable supporting him.Toomey went on: “I’m not there yet, I’m hoping to be able to get there, but it’s been problematic.”In a phone interview on Tuesday, Toomey asserted thatPennsylvania voters are entirely capable of ticket splitting and distinguishing between members of the same party. Voters are going to evaluate the Senate race entirely independently of the presidency.Toomey’s hope that he can separate himself from Trump is not widely shared by Republican strategists.Christopher Nicholas, president of the Republican Eagle Consulting Group in Harrisburg, described Trump as “an anchor” weighing down Republican candidates. The Democrats’ key goal is “to turn out the base in Philadelphia,” Nicholas said. “Trump will serve as a lightning rod doing their work for them.”In a separate interview, McGinty, whose only previous statewide campaign experience was an unsuccessful bid for the gubernatorial nomination in 2014, welcomed Trump’s presence.Toomey, she said, “is as hard right as Ted Cruz, but he likes to work in the shadows,” keeping his pro-Wall Street record out of the limelight. “Trump forces Toomey out of the shadows.”Despite Toomey’s claim that voters will view him as distinct from Trump, three separate Democratic pollsters — who gave me numbers while insisting on anonymity because they did not want to interfere with their current client relationships — report a “strong overlap” in support for Trump and Toomey, on one side, and for Clinton and McGinty, on the other.“McGinty is terrific on TV,” Rendell said. “She came across very well on TV ads, she speaks well, she has energy and passion.” He cautioned, however, that McGinty “in person, gets distracted” and can go “off message. She is not into candidate discipline yet.”Toomey is a formidable candidate, according to Rendell, who described the senator as “a very likable person, a pretty decent guy, a guy who isn’t hateful or trying to divide the country.” Rendell added that Toomey is “a perfect blend – a conservative who appeals to the base, yet is moderate in tone and does not say dumb things.”The salience voters give to the two major issues of the election — first, the interlocking concerns over terror, immigration and security; second, the economy — will determine the outcome of both the presidential and Senate races in Pennsylvania.chronic budget deficits, are in danger of failing to pay employees, or face default on their bond payments.At the same time, population projections by the Census Bureau forecast that the lion’s share of future growth in the state will be heavily concentrated in the highly Democratic precincts of metropolitan Philadelphia.The massacre in Orlando on Sunday morning by a self-proclaimed ISIS-linked gunman – an American citizen of Afghan descent with a history of Muslim religious observance — has for the moment raised the fear of terror, a development that Democrats in McGinty’s camp privately acknowledge works to the advantage of Republicans.McGinty, for her part, said American policy toward Syrian refugees must be governed by “two imperatives” — primarily that there should be a “thoroughgoing vetting process” to prevent the entry of possible terrorists, but also that we should “be true to our values and principles to welcome those fleeing oppression.”It is fair to say that one key factor in the outcome of both the Pennsylvania senate race and the presidential election will be how many more, if any, armed-to-the-teeth Omar Mateen-type killers surface between now and Election Day. A volatile mixture of economic stress and globalization — including the globalization of terrorist attacks by nonstate actors — may determine both the near-term and the far-term course of American politics.Thomas B.
