AdvertisementSupported byThe key to a legitimate Russia investigation has always been Republicans not named Donald Trump.But the White House counsel, Donald McGahn (pronounced “McGann”), refused to send the order to the Justice Department, which would have had to carry out any firing. Removing Mueller, McGahn told other White House officials, “would have a catastrophic effect” on Trump’s presidency. As McGahn expected, Trump then backed down.I would caution people not to lionize McGahn. He’s been involved in some of this administration’s seedier acts, including the nomination of unqualified federal-judge candidates, at least one of whom had personal ties to him. He also played a role in previous attempts by the White House to muck up the Russia investigation, including the firing of James Comey as the F.B.I. director.But McGahn acted honorably and bravely when it mattered most. He flat-out refused an order from his boss, which is never easy, let alone when your boss is the president and the order deals with the most explosive subject in politics. He doesn’t deserve to be lionized, but he does deserve praise.Unfortunately, other Republicans may soon find themselves facing the same decision as McGahn did. Trump has recently been offering conciliatory words about the investigation, but there is every reason to think he is afraid of it — and willing to do almost anything to obstruct it. Here’s hoping other Republicans show the same courage as McGahn.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
