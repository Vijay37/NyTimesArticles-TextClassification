Their political views stretch from conservative to liberal, with most of them in the center.Even though we worked for eight years with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s family in the White House and in Texas, we have long admired and been friends with many Republicans, including President Bush 41 and Barbara, as well as President Bush 43 and Laura.Respect for one another is the binding glue that holds our friendships together — even when we disagree strongly on politics and policies.My personal appeal for greater civility and more respect for the views of others will be seen as nonsense by many who read this. Yet I believe that the extreme divisiveness in this campaign year is very harmful to America, the country we all love. I, for one, think that we can and should do much better.TOM JOHNSONAtlantaThe writer was chairman of CNN, a former publisher of The Los Angeles Times and an aide to President Johnson.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
