He noted that soldiers were regularly subjected to urinalysis and told to stay away from the drug. “It puts veterans in a very difficult position.”“He is putting politics, antiquated policies and his own personal opinion ahead of the health needs of veterans in this country,” said Nick Etten, executive director of Veterans Cannabis Project, referring to Mr. Sessions.Veterans groups say the fastest and most effective way to help veterans get access to treatment is to simply reschedule the drug. That would automatically lift the most onerous barriers to research and allow V.A. health care providers to immediately prescribe marijuana in states where it is legal.But getting the necessary legislation through a fractious, conservative congress may still be a pipe dream.Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of a growing number of Republicans who have joined Democrats in trying to formally recast the government’s stance on marijuana. With Darren Soto, Democrat of Florida, Mr. Gaetz was co-author of a bill that would bump the drug down to Schedule 3 — the same classification as codeine and anabolic steroids.“I think my political party became too committed to this antiquated dogma of the ’70s and ’80s,” Mr. Gaetz said, referring to a time when cannabis was widely considered to be a “gateway” to more harmful drugs.“Now we’re having to pull the ostrich’s head out of the sand.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
