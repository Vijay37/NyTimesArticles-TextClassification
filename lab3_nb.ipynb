      "After enthusiastically endorsing an Alabama senator’s campaign for re-election, President Trump distanced himself on Tuesday night from the candidate’s loss in the most Trumpian way possible: He deleted his supportive tweets.\n",
      "Mr. Strange, who was appointed to the Senate early this year after Jeff Sessions vacated his seat to become attorney general under Mr. Trump, conceded on Tuesday night to Roy S. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose candidacy was opposed by leading establishment Republicans.\n",
      "Mr. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited Alabama on Friday to attend a rally for Mr. Strange. The closely watched campaign was seen by many as a barometer of Mr. Trump’s political sway. Mr. Strange was the first candidate endorsed by the president to lose an election since Mr. Trump took office.\n",
      "Around the same time the president was deleting tweets about Mr. Strange, he also deleted a tweet congratulating Mr. Moore on his victory. He later reposted that message, and early Wednesday he tweeted about speaking with Mr. Moore by telephone.\n",
      "It is unclear why the president chose to delete the tweets he did. Several tweets endorsing Mr. Strange, whom the president often called “Big Luther,” but which were sent in the weeks before Mr. Trump’s visit to Alabama, remain public.\n",
      "At a rally for Mr. Strange in Alabama on Friday, Mr. Trump openly wondered whether it was a mistake to campaign for the senator, given his flagging poll numbers.\n",
      "Even after getting elected president, Mr. Trump has maintained personal control of his Twitter account. He has used his posts to skewer opponents, respond to critics and, he says, to communicate directly to voters without the filter of the news media.\n",
      "“Twitter is a wonderful thing for me, because I get the word out,” he said in a March interview with Fox News. “I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didn’t have an honest way of getting the word out.”\n",
      "But if the president’s tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium, what then are we to make of the deletions?\n",
      "At least two government watchdog groups, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive, believe that when Mr. Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the law.\n",
      "The groups filed a lawsuit in June against Mr. Trump and the Executive Office of the President, claiming that deleting social media posts violates the Presidential Records Act, a law that requires presidential communications to be archived. The groups are also suing to require White House staff members to archive material sent through encrypted messaging apps, such as WhatsApp and Signal.\n",

      "Mr. Comey depicts Mr. Trump as a man engrossed to the point of distraction with political rivalries and fears that bureaucrats and government officials, including in the F.B.I., were trying to undermine his legitimacy.\n",
      "Here are six takeaways:\n",
      "Mr. Trump denied the episode had taken place and appeared to Mr. Comey to be defending himself. Mr. Comey replied that the allegations could have been made up, but that the job of the F.B.I. was to protect the president from efforts to coerce him.\n",
      "Though Mr. Trump ended the meeting genially, the accusations clearly stuck with him, Mr. Comey’s memos showed. At least twice more in the ensuing weeks, Mr. Trump laid out a timeline for Mr. Comey and claimed that it showed that such a tape could not exist.\n",
      "According to the memos, the president told Mr. Comey in a one-on-one dinner at the White House later in January 2017 that he had spoken with several people who had been on the trip with him. Mr. Trump said those people “reminded” him that he did not stay overnight in Moscow.\n",
      "Mr. Trump said that he had arrived in the morning, attended a series of events, then went to a hotel to shower and dress for the pageant, leaving Russia afterward.\n",
      "In a February 2017 meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Trump told Mr. Comey “‘the hookers thing’ is nonsense” but that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had told him that the country had “some of the most beautiful hookers in the world.”\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s decision to brief Mr. Trump on the dossier was based, at least in part, on the fact that American intelligence agencies had corroborated parts of the dossier, according to the memos.\n",
      "“I explained that the analysts from all three agencies agreed it was relevant and that portions of the material were corroborated by other intelligence,” Mr. Comey wrote in a memo in February 2017, describing how he responded to a question from Mr. Priebus about why he told the president-elect a month earlier about the dossier.\n",
      "Parts of the memo are redacted but appear to say that information in the dossier “was consistent with and corroborated by other intelligence, and that the incoming president needed to know the rest of it was out there.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump also raised on several occasions Mr. Comey’s deputy at the F.B.I., Andrew G. McCabe, according to the memos. Mr. McCabe had been the subject of right-wing attacks over his involvement in the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s handling of classified information while secretary of state. His wife, Jill, received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for her failed Virginia State Senate campaign from a political committee run by a longtime Clinton ally.\n",
      "Some conservatives insisted that Mr. McCabe should have recused himself from the Clinton investigation to avoid bias, and Mr. Trump joined in those attacks on the campaign trail.\n",
      "According to the memos, Mr. Trump asked Mr. Comey during their January dinner whether Mr. McCabe “had a problem” with the president.\n",
      "“I was pretty rough on him and his wife during the campaign,” Mr. Trump ventured. Mr. Comey tried to smooth over the issue by explaining that F.B.I. agents and officials pride themselves on being apolitical.\n",
      "“l explained that Andy was a true professional and had no problem at all,” Mr. Comey wrote. “I then explained what F.B.I. people were like, that whatever their personal views, they strip them when they step into their bureau roles and actually hold ‘political people’ in slight contempt without regard to party.”\n",
      "The president broached the subject again during dinner, and the F.B.I. director repeated his response.\n",
      "“I again affirmed Andy’s ability and professionalism and said the president would come to see and benefit from both,” Mr. Comey wrote.\n",
      "In an Oval Office meeting weeks later, Mr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe again.\n",
      "“He asked (as he had at our dinner) whether my deputy had a problem with him, and recounting how hard he had been on the campaign trail, saying, ‘The No. 2 guy at the F.B.I. took a million dollars from the Clintons.’”\n",
      "Mr. Comey said he again explained that Mr. McCabe was “a pro” and had never mentioned Mr. Trump’s attacks.\n",
      "At their dinner, Mr. Trump gave contradictory explanations about whether Mr. Priebus knew they were meeting.\n",
      "Early on, as they discussed whom Mr. Comey’s point of contact should be at the White House, Mr. Trump said that “Reince doesn’t know we are having dinner” but that Mr. Comey should plan to go to him.\n",
      "But as Mr. Comey was preparing to leave the White House that night, Mr. Trump told him: ”Reince knows we are having dinner’ (the opposite of what he said earlier),” according to one memo.\n",
      "Mr. Comey neither explained nor speculated why Mr. Trump contradicted himself.\n",
      "In their own meeting on Feb. 8, 2017, Mr. Priebus tried to ask Mr. Comey whether the F.B.I. was wiretapping the national security adviser at the time, Michael T. Flynn.\n",
      "Weeks earlier, reports had emerged that Mr. Flynn was overheard on a wiretap talking with the Russian ambassador to the United States about sanctions being imposed by the Obama administration as punishment for its election interference. The calls raised concerns among senior law enforcement and intelligence agencies that Mr. Flynn might have been working to help the Russians.\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s answer was redacted in the released version of the memos. But it is widely believed that Mr. Flynn was overheard on the wiretap because American intelligence agencies routinely listen in on the calls of foreign ambassadors.\n",
      "Mr. Comey said he then explained how such questions should be routed from the White House counsel’s office to the Justice Department.\n",
      "“I explained that it was important that communications about any particular case go through that channel to protect us and to protect the W.H. from any accusations of improper influence,” Mr. Comey said, using shorthand for the White House.\n",
      "In one February conversation, the two men discussed leaks in the news media at length. By then, Mr. Trump had endured several embarrassing disclosures of classified information, including transcripts of his calls with foreign leaders in which he was short with the leaders of American allies, including Australia and Mexico.\n",
      "In his memo, Mr. Comey explained how he hoped to catch one of the leakers to set an example.\n",
      "“I said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message,” Mr. Comey said. “I said something about it being difficult and he replied that we need to go after the reporters and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago, we put them in jail to find what they know and it worked.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump then mentioned Judith Miller, a former reporter for The New York Times. In 2005, Ms. Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify and reveal her confidential source about the identity of a former C.I.A. operative, Valerie Plame, before relenting.\n",
      "“I explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky, for legal reasons and because D.O.J. tends to approach it conservatively,” Mr. Comey said. The president, he said, suggested he speak to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about being more aggressive in prosecuting leaks.\n",

      "Mr. Trump has made clear that his frustration with Mr. Sessions, the former Alabama senator who was one of his earliest campaign supporters, stems from the attorney general’s decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr. Trump’s associates conspired with Russia.\n",
      "The pattern has fueled suspicion that Mr. Trump is trying to bully Mr. Sessions into resigning — and might fire him if he does not leave voluntarily — in order to clear the way for a replacement who would take control of that investigation. Here is a breakdown of possible legal and procedural paths such a maneuver could take.\n",
      "If Mr. Trump were to order Mr. Mueller fired and Mr. Rosenstein refused — and then resigned or was himself fired by Mr. Trump — it could set up a repetition of the so-called Saturday Night Massacre of 1973, in which Richard M. Nixon’s search for a Justice Department official willing to fire the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal prompted a cascade of resignations. That would increase political risks for Mr. Trump.\n",
      "A new attorney general who is not recused from the Trump-Russia investigation would take over from Mr. Rosenstein as the overseer of the special counsel investigation and could fire Mr. Mueller — either by declaring that Mr. Mueller has overstepped in some way, or by first modifying Justice Department regulations to eliminate the rule protecting special counsels.\n",
      "A new attorney general could also declare that the regular Justice Department can handle the investigation after all, disbanding Mr. Mueller’s staff. And he or she could direct investigators to swiftly wrap up their work while narrowly interpreting their jurisdiction, such as limiting their ability to scrutinize whether Mr. Trump’s interactions with James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director fired by the president, amounted to obstruction of justice.\n",
      "It could. If the chamber goes into a formal recess before leaving Washington next month for its annual break, Mr. Trump could make recess appointments while senators are on vacation.\n",
      "Yes. Congress can prevent presidents from making appointments during its breaks by holding so-called pro forma sessions, in which a senator comes into the otherwise-empty chamber every few days and bangs the gavel. That technically breaks up a long recess into a series of short ones — each too brief to trigger appointment powers.\n",
      "That is not clear. The Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, called upon Republicans on Tuesday to use pro forma sessions in August to prevent Mr. Trump from appointing “someone during the August recess who will fire Special Counsel Mueller and shut down the Russia investigation.” He also vowed that Democrats would try to do that on their own if Republicans refused.\n",
      "Before the Senate adjourns for more than three days, Congress adopts a concurrent resolution giving it the authority to do so. That is normally routine, but Democrats are discussing whether to try to block any up-or-down vote on such a resolution by offering an unlimited series of amendments to its date and time for reconvening. If the Senate gives up and leaves town without such a resolution, the Constitution would require pro forma sessions every three days, blocking recess appointments.\n",
      "Alan S. Frumin, who served as the Senate’s chief parliamentarian from 1987 to 1995 and from 2001 to 2012, said Republicans could “quash such a filibuster by amendment” using what some call the nuclear option to change the rules. Under that scenario, if a majority of senators vote to deem the Democrats’ amendments “dilatory,” they could adjourn in a way that leaves Mr. Trump free to make recess appointments. But if at least three Republican senators break ranks, the Senate would need to meet every three days.\n",
      "The Constitution also says that if the House and Senate disagree when to adjourn, the president “may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper.” That suggests Mr. Trump might be able to force the Senate into a lengthy recess. But no president has tried to exercise this power, and it is not clear what would constitute such a disagreement: Mr. Frumin said that the House typically gives its consent for the Senate to adjourn for more than three days but does not order the Senate to do so.\n",
      "“This would be an enormous political and constitutional danger,” he said. “If he can force them into adjournment, he can in essence terminate Congress.”\n",
      "Firing Mr. Sessions and Mr. Mueller would be a shocking moment for Washington, where many Republicans in Congress have expressed support for Mr. Mueller and conservatives like Mr. Sessions. But Republicans have also shown no appetite for impeachment proceedings to replace Mr. Trump with Vice President Pence, and it is an open question what, if anything, it would take to change that.\n",
      "On Tuesday, House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, was asked about Mr. Trump apparently laying the groundwork to fire Mr. Sessions and make a recess appointment of someone who could fire Mr. Mueller. He was asked if he was concerned.\n",
      "“Look, the president gets to decide what his personnel is,” Mr. Ryan replied, adding: “He determines who gets hired and fired in the executive branch. That’s his prerogative.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — For Hillary Clinton, the sudden fall of James B. Comey is wrapped in multiple layers of irony.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton blames Mr. Comey for tilting the presidential election against her in the closing days of last year’s campaign by announcing that the F.B.I. might reopen its investigation of her email practices while she was at the State Department.\n",
      "Yet her satisfaction at seeing him lose his job, friends said, is offset by worries that it could derail the F.B.I.’s investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton, these people said, puts no stock in President Trump’s stated rationale for dismissing Mr. Comey as the F.B.I. director — that he mishandled the bureau’s investigation of her email case — even though she fundamentally agrees with that damning assessment.\n",
      "One person who spoke with Mrs. Clinton after the White House’s announcement said she has a “mixed mind” about his firing. While Mrs. Clinton believes that Mr. Comey interfered with the election, this person said, “taking him out of his job at this point only reinforces the point that he was on to something.”\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton has said nothing publicly about the F.B.I. director’s dismissal. In her most recent Twitter post, on May 7, she celebrated the victory of Emmanuel Macron in France’s presidential election, which she said was a “defeat to those interfering w/democracy.”\n",
      "Top officials from her campaign said there was no joy in Hillaryland at Mr. Trump’s startling decision. They worry that the president will nominate a more pliable figure than Mr. Comey to run the F.B.I.; that Mr. Trump will be able to muscle that person through a Republican-controlled Senate, which needs only 51 votes to confirm the nominee; and that the new F.B.I. director may not pursue the evidence in the Russian investigation as aggressively as Mr. Comey did.\n",
      "“There is no one I have encountered in Clintonworld who views this as a positive development,” said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign’s former communications director. “When I heard the news, my first thought was, ‘They must be getting close.’”\n",
      "One potential benefit, she said, is that the furor surrounding Mr. Comey’s ouster may put a greater spotlight on Russia’s meddling in the election. The Clinton campaign struggled before the election to generate interest in Russia’s role beyond core Democrats, Ms. Palmieri said.\n",
      "How big a role Mr. Comey played in Mrs. Clinton’s defeat is a subject of debate, even within her inner circle. In the immediate aftermath of the vote, she told donors, “Our analysis is that Comey’s letter raising doubts that were groundless, baseless, proven to be, stopped our momentum.” She has continued to emphasize the F.B.I.’s role. Her friends say she believes that but for Mr. Comey and the Russians, she would be president.\n",
      "In a recent interview, Mrs. Clinton was asked how she felt when watching Mr. Comey tell Congress he believed it was inappropriate before the election to disclose the F.B.I.’s investigation of the Trump campaign’s ties to Russia, which began in July. She responded, dryly, “That was one of the high points of the last weeks.”\n",
      "Other officials, however, said the F.B.I. intervention was one of a torrent of negative developments for the Democratic campaign, including the release of campaign emails by WikiLeaks, that sapped its momentum in the weeks after the third debate between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump. “We had a lot coming at us, and it was one too many things,” Ms. Palmieri said.\n",
      "In recent conversations, Democratic officials have faulted the Clinton campaign’s message and her use of a private email server as secretary of state. They have also cited structural impediments, like gender bias and Mrs. Clinton’s identity as an establishment figure in a “change election.”\n",
      "Whatever the other factors, Mr. Comey has become a singularly baleful figure to people who worked on her campaign.\n",
      "When Mr. Comey testified last week that he felt “mildly nauseous” at the idea that he might have swayed the election, John D. Podesta, who was the campaign’s chairman, wrote on Twitter, “The American public is getting mildly nauseous listening to Jim Comey.”\n",
      "Jake Sullivan, who was Mrs. Clinton’s senior policy adviser, said he was still assessing the implications of Mr. Comey’s dismissal. “Most see it as a transparent abuse of power,” he said. “I’m not sure what to make of it or what its implications will be.”\n",
      "As news of Mr. Comey’s dismissal spread, other veterans of the campaign reacted on social media with a mix of lingering bitterness about the email case and foreboding about the future.\n",
      "“Twilight zone,” Robby Mook, the former campaign manager, said on Twitter. “I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled. But this terrifies me.”\n",
      "Brian Fallon, a campaign spokesman, wrote on Twitter early Wednesday: “The descent into authoritarianism does not announce itself with the blaring of trumpets. It happens via events like today.”\n",

      "The search warrant carried out by the public corruption unit of the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan sought information about Karen McDougal, a former Playboy model who claims she carried on a nearly yearlong affair with Mr. Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006. Ms. McDougal was paid $150,000 by American Media Inc., The Enquirer’s parent company, whose chief executive is a friend of Mr. Trump’s.\n",
      "Stephen Ryan, Mr. Cohen’s lawyer, said that it was Mr. Mueller who referred evidence to the federal authorities in New York who carried out Monday’s raids. In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Ryan repeated his assertion that the raids were “inappropriate and unnecessary.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump has been dogged for months by accusations that women with whom he is said to have had affairs were paid to keep quiet before the election — charges that the White House has repeatedly said he denies.\n",
      "Ms. McDougal has claimed that she had a 10-month consensual affair with Mr. Trump 12 years ago. American Media, which is owned by David J. Pecker, agreed to pay Ms. McDougal $150,000 for the rights to her story in August 2016, but did not publish it in a practice known as catch and kill. Ms. Clifford, who told her story about an affair with Mr. Trump to CBS’s “60 Minutes” last month, is aggressively challenging the nondisclosure agreement she agreed to in October 2016, receiving $130,000 in return.\n",
      "It is unclear exactly why the New York investigators are examining the payments. But critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions because they helped Mr. Trump win the White House by suppressing politically damaging stories.\n",
      "The F.B.I. also searched for records related to Mr. Cohen’s New York taxicab business, apparently a separate line of inquiry unrelated to Mr. Trump. Mr. Cohen is a longtime owner of taxi medallions, at one point operating a fleet of more than 200 cabs in Manhattan.\n",
      "Besides enraging Mr. Trump, the early-morning searches, associates said, also led him to privately wonder whether he should fire Rod J. Rosenstein, the veteran prosecutor appointed by Mr. Trump to serve as deputy attorney general. Mr. Rosenstein personally signed off on Monday’s F.B.I. decision to raid the office of Mr. Cohen, several government officials said.\n",
      "Justice Department regulations require prosecutors to consult with senior officials in Washington, but not necessarily the deputy attorney general, before conducting a search of a lawyer’s files, which is among the most delicate steps federal prosecutors can take in an investigation.\n",
      "As Mr. Trump has stewed over the developments, he has cast blame in many directions. Privately, people close to the president said, he has blamed Mr. Cohen for acknowledging the payments to Ms. Clifford.\n",
      "On Monday evening, Mr. Trump called the court-authorized raids an “attack on our country” — unusually harsh language that he has not used to describe Russia’s attempts to influence an American election through hacking and propaganda — and the raids are likely to complicate Mr. Trump’s negotiations with Mr. Mueller over the terms of a possible interview.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s lawyers have warned that such an interview would be incredibly risky, but Mr. Trump had been confident in his ability and was eager to sit for one. People close to the president said the raids could change that thinking.\n",
      "The president’s reaction has deeply unsettled aides, current and former Justice Department officials and lawmakers from both parties, who believe the president may use the raids as a pretext to purge the team leading the Russia investigation.\n",
      "“Now is the time for officials in the executive branch and Congress who care about the rule of law to counsel against any effort to undermine the special counsel’s work,” said David Laufman, a former top Justice Department official who oversaw the Russia investigation before Mr. Mueller’s appointment.\n",
      "Adding to the concern among Mr. Trump’s aides about his mood is the release next week of a book by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, which is expected to be sharply critical of the president.\n",
      "The involvement of Mr. Rosenstein and top prosecutors in New York in the raids of Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room makes it harder for Mr. Trump to argue that his legal problems are the result of a witch hunt led by Mr. Mueller. In addition to Mr. Rosenstein, all of the top law enforcement officials involved in the raids are Republicans, including Mr. Mueller and Christopher A. Wray, Mr. Trump’s choice to succeed Mr. Comey as director of the F.B.I.\n",
      "Geoffrey Berman, the interim United States attorney for Southern District of New York, which oversaw the raids, has been recused from the case, according to one person with knowledge with the matter. The precise reason was not clear, but under Justice Department guidelines, a United States attorney must report any issue that could require recusal “as a result of an actual or apparent conflict of interest.”\n",
      "Mr. Berman, who worked as a volunteer lawyer on Mr. Trump’s campaign, was the choice of Donald F. McGahn II, the White House counsel, to be the United States attorney in New York, according to a person with direct knowledge of the appointment.\n",
      "While Mr. Trump is focused for the moment on Mr. Rosenstein, many of the president’s advisers and allies are fearful that the president also intends to fire Mr. Mueller in an attempt to end the Russia investigation. Asked by reporters on Monday night whether he intends to do so, Mr. Trump said, “We’ll see what happens.”\n",
      "Despite Tuesday’s assertions by Ms. Sanders, many legal experts believe the president cannot fire Mr. Mueller himself, and would have to direct Mr. Rosenstein to do so. Mr. Rosenstein has told Congress that he would dismiss Mr. Mueller only for cause, and people close to Mr. Rosenstein have indicated that he would resign if he were ordered to fire Mr. Mueller by the president.\n",
      "Bipartisan legislation has been introduced to protect Mr. Mueller, with senators urging Mr. Trump to let the inquiry go forward “without impediment.” Republican leadership has dismissed such legislation as unnecessary.\n",
      "The prospect that Mr. Trump might still find a way to fire Mr. Mueller elicited angry responses from Congressional Democrats and some Republicans, who warned that such a move would be disastrous for the White House.\n",
      "Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that “it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing Mueller.”\n",
      "On Monday, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, called Mr. Trump’s attacks on Mr. Mueller and his team a “grave reminder of his utter contempt for the rule of law.” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate’s top Democrat, urged the president: “Don’t do it, do not go down this path. For the sake of our country, we plead with you.”\n",

      "Wall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 1.8 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the so-called Trump rally since last year’s election. Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy uplift.\n",
      "The promise of relaxed regulation, corporate tax cuts, and investment in America’s crumbling roads and bridges under President Trump and a Republican Congress has excited investors for most of the past six months.\n",
      "Clinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals, not least the daily dysfunction in the nation’s capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade. There were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling United States health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling into the election.\n",
      "Investors elsewhere have expressed a good deal of concern about the chances of Congress’s passing legislation that might buoy both the economy and corporate bottom lines. The United States dollar index is right back where it was in early November. The 10-year Treasury yield, after soaring to 2.6 percent from under 2 percent, has retreated to 2.2 percent.\n",
      "The biggest market slump since September means equity investors are getting rattled, too. For that to happen, though, it took news that Mr. Trump had asked James B. Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to end an investigation into the administration’s first national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn — along with the ensuing fallout, which has stirred mention of the word impeachment on Capitol Hill.\n",
      "There are, of course, other factors behind the stock market surge. For example, nearly all S & P 500 constituents have reported first-quarter results, revealing average profit growth of about 15 percent, according to Thomson Reuters data. Interest rates are low, and the employment picture is solid.\n",
      "Even after Wednesday’s wobble, however, bank shares have jumped by more than a fifth, and the broader market is still up by some 13 percent since Mr. Trump won at the polls. That translates into a valuation of about 25 times earnings, a multiple hard to justify without at least factoring in ancillary benefits such as a tax cut. It should mean there is a bigger D.C. discount in store.\n",

      "PHILADELPHIA — A day after vowing to stay in his job despite a reproof from the president, Attorney General Jeff Sessions pressed his immigration agenda on Friday in Philadelphia, a so-called sanctuary city that limits its cooperation with federal immigration authorities.\n",
      "“The residents of Philadelphia have been victimized,” Mr. Sessions told federal prosecutors here, denouncing the city for “giving sanctuary to criminals.”\n",
      "Philadelphia’s police commissioner later rebutted Mr. Sessions, saying the city now had “one of the lowest crime rates since the 1970s.”\n",
      "Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney, a Democrat, said Friday that crime rates declined the year he reinstated a sanctuary city policy, and he argued that the Trump administration’s posture was counterproductive. “If victims and witnesses of crimes don’t report those crimes to the police because they fear deportation, that allows the real bad guys to stay on the streets,” Mr. Kenney said.\n",
      "Richard Ross Jr., Philadelphia’s police commissioner, also disputed Mr. Sessions’s characterizations of the city.\n",
      "“We don’t harbor anyone — we’re a welcoming city, not a sanctuary city” for criminals, Commissioner Ross said, adding that Philadelphia “can’t afford” to lose federal funding.\n",
      "Despite Mr. Sessions’s speech, the commissioner said he didn’t “personally believe that we belong in the immigration business.”\n",
      "Still, in some 25 minutes of remarks, Mr. Sessions subtly answered another rebuke the president had made in the interview, this one of Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, who in May appointed a special counsel to lead the government’s Russia investigation.\n",
      "Mr. Trump, a Republican, bemoaned that Mr. Rosenstein was “from Baltimore,” a heavily Democratic city. While Mr. Rosenstein worked there as the United States attorney in Maryland, he has lived in the suburbs of Washington and is from the Philadelphia area.\n",
      "Within moments of taking the lectern Friday, Mr. Sessions indirectly corrected the record. “Rod Rosenstein is from this area — a University of Pennsylvania Wharton business school graduate,” he said, naming the president’s own alma mater. “He’s really a good guy.”\n",
      "“Hopefully we’ll get the rest of them moving fast,” Mr. Sessions said. “I do my best every day,” he added, “to fulfill the goals the president and I share.”\n",

      "Mr. McCabe is a 21-year F.B.I. veteran who joined the bureau out of law school and rose to its No. 2 position in 2016. The deputy director is essentially the F.B.I.’s chief operating officer.\n",
      "He oversaw two of the most politically charged cases in F.B.I. history: the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, and the investigation of Donald J. Trump’s campaign ties to the Russian government.\n",
      "Mr. McCabe was questioned as part of a wide-ranging internal inquiry into the F.B.I.’s handling of the Clinton investigation and other matters. During the internal investigation, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said, Mr. McCabe “lacked candor — including under oath — on multiple occasions.” That is a fireable offense, and Mr. Sessions said that career, apolitical employees at the F.B.I. and Justice Department agreed that Mr. McCabe should be fired.\n",
      "At issue is whether Mr. McCabe was forthcoming with investigators about what Mr. Sessions said was an “unauthorized disclosure to the news media.”\n",
      "Mr. McCabe authorized an F.B.I. spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation. These types of interactions between journalists and government officials — known as “background calls” — are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish information.\n",
      "The Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas, the F.B.I. in fact had pressed ahead with the case — a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs. Clinton, not Mr. Trump.\n",
      "No. As a career civil servant, Mr. McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president. But this is where the situation gets complicated. Mr. Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr. McCabe. Months before the firing, he taunted Mr. McCabe about his pension.\n",
      "And he goaded Mr. Sessions into taking action against Mr. McCabe.\n",
      "On the eve of Mr. McCabe’s firing, the White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, called him a “bad actor.” Taken together, this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision. Mr. McCabe’s lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influence.\n",
      "That is one of the big unknowns. F.B.I. disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods, and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process. That did not happen here, and it is not clear why. The workings of the F.B.I.’s disciplinary office are kept confidential.\n",
      "Mr. McCabe’s lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing. Why the rush, they ask, if not to make sure that Mr. McCabe was fired?\n",
      "“This concerted effort to accelerate the process, in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement, violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness,” Mr. Bromwich said.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has seized on the fact that Mr. McCabe’s wife, Jill, ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs. Clinton. He says Mr. McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation. He says the campaign donations are proof that a pro-Clinton bias within the F.B.I. explains why Mrs. Clinton was never charged.\n",
      "Mr. Trump brought up Mr. McCabe’s wife on several occasions, including a face-to-face meeting in which the president called her a “loser.”\n",
      "Yes and no. Mr. McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race, and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the F.B.I. before deciding not to recuse himself. But some in the F.B.I. believe he should never have been involved because of his wife’s campaign donations.\n",
      "When he ultimately recused himself, late in the investigation, it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginning.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s theory of Mr. McCabe as a pro-Clinton partisan, however, is on far shakier ground. Mr. McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election. The newspaper story that Mr. McCabe authorized F.B.I. officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs. Clinton.\n",
      "And, perhaps most importantly, in the months before the election, when the F.B.I. publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation, it never revealed the existence and scope of a full-throated investigation into the Trump campaign’s Russia ties.\n",
      "Like so much at the F.B.I., Mr. McCabe’s firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.\n",
      "Mr. McCabe was one of only a handful of F.B.I. officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days. He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page, a former Trump foreign adviser. That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials, was reapproved by Mr. Trump’s own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr. Page was a Russian agent. Mr. Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper, however, and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the F.B.I.\n",
      "Mr. McCabe also worked alongside the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who accused Mr. Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation. Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation. Mr. McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr. Comey, which could help investigators corroborate Mr. Comey’s account.\n",
      "From a political standpoint, if Mr. Trump discredits Mr. McCabe, he can raise questions about everything Mr. McCabe has touched — including the Russia investigation. Mr. McCabe’s allies have come to his defense.\n",
      "What we know right now is that Mr. Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr. McCabe “lacked candor.” And career officials — not Trump appointees — recommended dismissal. Mr. Sessions accepted that recommendation.\n",
      "“The F.B.I. expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty, integrity, and accountability,” Mr. Sessions said.\n",
      "Mr. McCabe denies being untruthful. He says he answered every question honestly and, when he was misunderstood, he reached out to the investigators to correct the record.\n",
      "We won’t be able to assess the allegations, or Mr. McCabe’s defense, until the inspector general’s report is released. That is expected sometime this spring. Mr. McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public. When it is released, his lawyers say, he has a point-by-point rebuttal to offer.\n",

      "Bruce Springsteen may be an outspoken critic of President-elect Donald J. Trump, but his deep catalog of hits could be a part of the inauguration festivities.\n",
      "The gala’s planning committee first invited the band to play in 2009 for the inauguration of President Obama, and then again in 2013 for Mr. Obama’s re-election. B Street was such a hit that the gala organizers signed a contract in 2015 with the band to play this year — before Mr. Trump even announced his bid for the presidency.\n",
      "The band had no idea at the time that it would be playing at a Trump celebration, but that has not stopped Springsteen fans from voicing displeasure: They sent “several hundred” angry emails about the gig to B Street’s founder and keyboardist, Willie Forte, he said in an interview on Thursday.\n",
      "“I never saw this coming — this part coming,” Mr. Forte said of the uproar. “Are you asking me if, you know, if I would’ve reconsidered if I could go back in the beginning and I knew this was going to happen? Sure.”\n",
      "Mr. Forte said that he and his bandmates would cancel the performance if Mr. Springsteen asked them to but that they had not heard from his team, “thank God, so far.”\n",
      "He said B Street was not “a political band,” but rather played out of a love for the Garden State and to pay tribute to Mr. Springsteen, a man some might call the king of New Jersey.\n",
      "“I’ve gotten pushback from Springsteen fans that don’t know the reputation of our band or have never seen the band or talked to any of us,” Mr. Forte said.\n",
      "Organizers of the gala staunchly defended the band’s participation.\n",
      "“Springsteen music is magic to the ears of our New Jersey members and guests, regardless of party,” Nancy Blades Fatemi, executive director of the New Jersey State Society, which holds the gala, said in a statement. “It’s like, when you look at a Rembrandt or read Shakespeare, do you care what their politics were?\n",
      "“You can’t have an inaugural ball with a Jersey Shore boardwalk theme and not have great Jersey music,” she said. “Either the band or the D.J. will be playing Springsteen, Four Seasons, Frank Sinatra, the music legends that make us proud as New Jerseyans.”\n",
      "Ms. Fatemi also said of B Street, “We consider them the official band of the New Jersey State Society and would not consider any other group.”\n",
      "The band formed in 1980 as Backstreets but changed its name to B Street after a lawsuit over the name in the late ’80s, Mr. Forte said. The band has performed Mr. Springsteen’s music thousands of times, according to Mr. Forte, including at Mr. Christie’s first inauguration as governor. Mr. Christie is an avowed Springsteen fan, even if he is on the opposite side of the political spectrum.\n",
      "“We’re just a little satellite,” Mr. Forte said. “A bunch of working-class musicians, you know, around the big sun. You know, I mean we circle around the Springsteen sphere a little bit.”\n",
      "Mr. Forte said that after Mr. Trump’s election victory, he considered pulling the band from the gala but reconsidered.\n",
      "“I grew up with a family that taught me that when you give a commitment, when you make a promise, when you sign a contract, you go through it,” he said. “I mean, I understand circumstances around it. But I don’t know if I have that type of integrity to break a contract on somebody, you know, in good faith.”\n",
      "“I think that a lot of the tension is because there’s no entertainment there,” said Mr. Forte, who declined to say whom he voted for. “Because everybody else is gone, we went way, way up on the top of the list and all of a sudden, we became the bullet, the target.”\n",
      "Mr. Springsteen himself has ratcheted up criticism of the president-elect. Earlier this month, he told Marc Maron, the host of the popular podcast “WTF With Marc Maron,” that he was scared of a Trump presidency.\n",
      "“How could you not be?” Mr. Springsteen said.\n",

      "For the first time in history, the chaplain of the House of Representatives has been fired. Our two questions, naturally, are: A) Why? And B) Can we blame Donald Trump?\n",
      "We do not normally spend a heck of a lot of time dwelling on the House chaplain, since his (or theoretically, her) job is just to give an opening-of-the-session prayer and provide private counseling to members and the House staff.\n",
      "Now, Patrick Conroy, the Jesuit priest who’s been chaplain for nearly seven years, is on his way out. A lot of people are shocked. “Washington can be a very mean place,” said Trump on Friday. “A nasty place.”\n",
      "Otherwise, the best explanation anyone has come up with is that the priest was being punished for a prayer he gave last November, at the opening of a debate on the Republican tax bill. Conroy asked the Almighty to make sure that the members’ efforts “guarantee that there are not winners and losers under new tax laws, but benefits balanced and shared by all Americans.”\n",
      "Clearly a hostile act.\n",
      "“Invoking fairness if you’re a chaplain is apparently a firing offense,” said Representative Gerald Connolly, a Virginia Democrat who’s been leading a pro-Conroy rebellion.\n",
      "Actually, the idea that Conroy was being fired for asking God for a fair tax bill is one of the more palatable explanations for Ryan’s behavior. A popular alternative is that some non-Catholic lawmakers were just getting tired of having a priest in the job.\n",
      "Representative Mark Walker, a conservative Republican who is co-chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, stirred up a squall when he suggested the next chaplain should be a family man, with a wife and “adult children.” Clearly, that’s going to eliminate any new Jesuits. (Asked for comment, Walker’s office said he was “not excluding any faith or denomination.”)\n",
      "House members staged a very short uprising on Friday, with a passel of Democrats and a couple of Republicans calling for an investigation. Those of you who are aware of the way the House of Representatives functions will not be stunned to hear that the motion was rather quickly snuffed out by a mostly party-line vote.\n",
      "It cannot possibly be a good sign that an ancient invitation to homicide is coming up so frequently. But you have to admit this time the quote works pretty well, what with the actual priest and all.\n",
      "Ryan, who’s been vague about his motives, apparently did complain about the tax prayer. (Conroy says he told him, “Padre, you just got to stay out of politics.”) But that was last year. Why do you think this is all happening now, when the 115th Congress is nearly over?\n",
      "Possibly there’s a growing Republican hysteria around that tax bill. They were so proud of it, and it’s virtually the only thing Republicans have accomplished. Now, they’re going back to their districts to run for re-election and discovering that most voters are unenthralled.\n",
      "So getting rid of Conroy might have been an exercise in pique. (And if you happen to hear a Republican member of Congress is bragging about tax cuts, feel free to yell, “If they’re so good, why did you fire that priest?”)\n",
      "Otherwise, the timing is a mystery. Ryan himself is leaving Congress at the end of the year. When he announced his retirement, some malcontents muttered that he ought to step down from the speaker’s job now and give someone else a turn. No way. “I intend to run through the tape, to finish the year,” said the man who loves everything about physical fitness, including metaphors.\n",
      "“Paul Ryan’s giving himself that luxury,” said Connolly. “Why wouldn’t you give it to the chaplain?”\n",
      "One possibility is that Republicans who actually care about the identity of the House chaplain think this speaker needs to make the appointment because they’re going to lose big in November and the next one will be a Democrat.\n",
      "Another is that Ryan has simply been driven crazy trying to deal with the Trump White House, the president’s strange, unsettling behavior and his endlessly contradictory comments. Maybe he just felt a need to act out.\n",
      "Let’s go with that explanation. It makes as much sense as anything, and we can pin Chaplaingate on you-know-who.\n",

      "He’s someone who wants to get stuff done — a politician who’s not beholden to any kind of ideology, not beholden to special interests. I don’t think he is George Wallace in his heart of hearts. He’s not a strategic threat to the future of the republic. He’s just a buffoon and a political opportunist.\n",
      "There’s no reason to believe most D.C. lobbyists would recognize such a threat if it strolled into their well-appointed offices and plopped itself down on one of their well-upholstered settees.\n",
      "The Republican establishment, including its cadre of lobbyists, Kristol continued, has\n",
      "a deeply ingrained instinct to accommodate those who threaten from without and to collaborate with the buffoons and opportunists who have established beachheads within.\n",
      "These Trump accommodationists have “brought to light the rot of an ideological movement that many of us had thought was alive and reasonably well.”\n",
      "To clear the air, Feehery noted that he has not endorsed anyone but “I really, really like John Kasich.” Feehery said that his own basic policy in elections is to “support whomever the Republican Party nominates.”\n",
      "He then counterattacked: “Our party is in the shape it is today because of people like Bill Kristol.”\n",
      "Kristol, in Feehery’s view, helped lay the groundwork for the Iraq invasion, “a huge mistake.” But most of all, Kristol\n",
      "believed that Sarah Palin would be the savior of the party and he promoted her heavily when she got on the ticket with John McCain.\n",
      "Palin, in turn, Feehery argues, “was the real start of the dumbing down of the G.O.P.,” a cascading process that led to Trump. “You don’t get to Donald Trump without Sarah Palin.”\n",
      "Trump, in Southside Chicago, saying “Make America Great Again” means your children shouldn’t be killed, your schools should actually work, there should be jobs in your neighborhood. I think that would shatter the fabric of the Democratic Party, and expose the degree to which they have exploited poor people without actually helping them. I think it would be very healthy for America.\n",
      "Trump is a bully, unworthy of our nomination. My love for our country eclipses my loyalty to our party, and to live with a clear conscience I will not support a nominee so lacking in the judgment, temperament and character needed to be our nation’s commander-in-chief. Accordingly, if left with no alternative, I will not support Trump in the general election should he become our Republican nominee.\n",
      "Nowhere on the right is the conflict as hostile as it is among conservative Christians.\n",
      "The only hope for the GOP is to be on God’s side. Allowing the GOP to move into Trumpism will lead away from that hope, not toward it.\n",
      "I am proud to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President of the United States. He is a successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.” Falwell also said, “I see a lot of parallels between my father and Donald Trump. Like Mr. Trump, Dad would speak his mind.\n",
      "In a phone interview, Moore described Trump as the embodiment of cultural decadence — the personification of the moral decline he says Christian leaders have struggled to halt for the past generation.\n",
      "“Some high profile evangelicals are completely repudiating the conviction that character matters,” Moore said. He described Trump as a\n",
      "Howard Stern conservative, a reflection of the pornographic culture combined with proletarian demagoguery. Some of the older generation of evangelical leaders standing behind Donald Trump should imagine what they would say if a Democratic candidate had done or said any of the things that Trump has, his boasts of adultery, his profiting from casinos, his putrid speech about minorities and women.\n",
      "Wherever he goes in religious circles, Moore said, Trump is the dominant subject of discussion: “How do we maintain the witness of the Christian church at a time when America seems to have gone crazy?”\n",
      "The truth is we either have primaries or we don’t; we either have rules or we don’t. What’s worse for a democracy: When a bad guy gets elected or when the losers refuse to lose? Whoever wins the primaries and is compliant with the rules should be the Republican nominee. Period.\n",
      "I don’t give a damn about the will of the people. I’m telling you that I personally will not ever support Donald Trump. If you don’t like it, deal with it. It’s the will of this person! The will of the people is just a polite way of saying the collective, which is the authoritarian, socialist destiny of this nation if Donald Trump is elected. I want no part of it and will play no role other than to stop Donald Trump.\n",
      "While only 37 percent of those polled considered Clinton “honest and trustworthy,” even fewer, 27 percent, believe that those words accurately describe Trump. When voters were asked if Clinton and Trump have the experience and personality to serve as president, Clinton beat Trump by 66-26 and 58-26 respectively.\n",
      "It is universally acknowledged, however, that this is not a normal election. One of Trump’s talents is the destruction and humiliation of his opponents, as the Republican candidates who have dropped out one after another can testify.\n",
      "The issues animating grass-roots voters — opposition to immigration, worries about wages and discomfort with America’s fast-changing demographics — are diverging from and at times colliding with the Republican establishment’s interests in free trade, lower taxes, less regulation and openness to immigration.\n",
      "The phrase “fast changing demographics” is a reference to the growing numbers of blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and other minorities, while the white share of the population steadily declines.\n",
      "Trump supporters think the appropriate response to white working-class decline is to shut the border, keep out Muslims, deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, oppose political correctness about race and gender, lash out at the journalists who supposedly encourage all of the social and cultural trends that need to be turned back and reversed, and kick out the elites leading both parties in favor of vastly smarter and tougher men like Donald Trump.\n",
      "As Republicans, if you think you are going to change very substantially for the worse Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in any substantial way, and at the same time you think you are going to win elections, it just really is not going to happen.\n",
      "I would say that Ted Cruz is leading in the “Jerry Falwell” wing, Marco Rubio is leading the “Billy Graham” wing and Trump is leading the “Jimmy Swaggart” wing.\n",
      "We should not demand to see the long-form certificate for Mr. Trump’s second birth. We should, though, ask about his personal character and fitness for office. His personal morality is clear, not because of tabloid exposés but because of his own boasts.\n",
      "Moore went on. Voters should\n",
      "count the cost of following Donald Trump. To do so would mean that we’ve decided to join the other side of the culture war, that image and celebrity and money and power and social Darwinist “winning” trump the conservation of moral principles and a just society. We ought to listen, to get past the boisterous confidence and the television lights and the waving arms and hear just whose speech we’re applauding.\n",
      "Trump has become a human wrecking ball. He may be able to assemble the 1,237 delegates needed to win his party’s nomination, but when he is done with that he will face the task of building a national coalition strong enough to make the old one he has destroyed irrelevant.\n",
      "In the face of this possibility, should we ask ourselves — whatever our beliefs are — to live up to Moore’s ethical values? What happens if we don’t?\n",

      "Here’s a look at what’s next:\n",
      "Mr. Trump must search for a new F.B.I. director. An announcement will not be made on Wednesday but is likely by the end of the week because Mr. Trump intends to fill the vacancy quickly, a White House official said Tuesday night. Whomever Mr. Trump chooses will be subject to Senate confirmation.\n",
      "Democrats quickly coalesced around a call for an independent prosecutor to take over the investigation into Russian meddling in the election, expressing distrust in the Justice Department.\n",
      "“The only way the American people can have faith in this investigation is for it to be led by a fearless, independent special prosecutor,” said the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "As Republican lawmakers learned of the firing Tuesday night in scattershot fashion, no unified party message emerged. Some backed Mr. Trump and expressed support for a new start. Others were dubious.\n",
      "Given the recent controversies surrounding the Director, I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation well.\n",
      "I've spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comey's firing. I just can't do it.\n",
      "The Senate Intelligence Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into Russian tampering in the election, has faced mounting calls for an independent investigator that were, until now, largely partisan.\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s firing upended the politics of the committee and prompted some Republicans to echo those sentiments.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the committee, would not say when, or if, subpoenas might come.\n",
      "Until Mr. Trump appoints a new director, the deputy director, Andrew G. McCabe, will oversee the F.B.I., including the continuing Russia investigation.\n",
      "While the director is not usually involved in the day-to-day operations of the Russia investigation, whomever Mr. Trump selects as the next director will have the ability to influence the investigation by adding or pulling resources.\n",
      "The new director will also have to confront the task of winning over rank-and-file agents. While some of Mr. Comey’s decisions were controversial, he was popular among the staff, and the public way that he learned about his termination — from a television screen while he was speaking to F.B.I. employees in Los Angeles — will probably stay in their minds.\n",

      "The shifting statements also illustrated starkly why some of the president’s lawyers have urged him not to submit to an interview by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice to thwart that investigation. Those lawyers have said Mr. Mueller is setting a perjury trap for Mr. Trump. What they do not say publicly is that they worry the president would be unable to avoid contradicting himself.\n",
      "Under the unforgiving glare of federal prosecutors, however, misrepresentations carry far greater jeopardy. In nearly a year on the case, Mr. Mueller has shown that he is more than willing to charge associates of Mr. Trump with lying to investigators; independent lawyers have said it would be reckless for the president’s lawyers to allow him to be interviewed. Even supporters who maintain that Mr. Trump is essentially a truth teller acknowledge that he can be loose with details.\n",
      "For Mr. Trump, it is about creating a narrative that suits his desired image, and dictating the terms of his own life — in media coverage, in his business, in politics, even in his medical care. But he now risks losing his grip on the story line he has long sought to control, in part because of his own treatment of associates like his doctor and the lawyer who paid the porn star.\n",
      "This week’s revelation about the true origin of the doctor’s statement may not have surprised many. When Dr. Harold N. Bornstein released a letter in December 2015 saying that Mr. Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency,” few believed it was authentic. It contained the exact language about “strength and stamina” that the candidate often used to describe himself.\n",
      "From complete denial to acknowledging involvement, what President Trump and his lawyers said about the $130,000 paid to the pornographic film actress.\n",
      "But in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night, Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor now serving as a lawyer for the president, said Mr. Trump had reimbursed Mr. Cohen for the money.\n",
      "In a follow-up interview on Thursday morning, Mr. Giuliani said Mr. Trump did not actually learn the specifics until recently. “He didn’t know the details of this until we knew the details of this, which was a couple weeks ago,” Mr. Giuliani said. “Maybe not even a couple — maybe 10 days ago.”\n",
      "Mr. Giuliani seemed less concerned with explaining Mr. Trump’s previous denial than with emphasizing that it was the candidate’s personal money and therefore could not be a violation of campaign finance law. He said the payment to Ms. Clifford as part of a nondisclosure agreement was made in October 2016 only to protect Mr. Trump’s family from a false allegation, not to influence the election less than two weeks later.\n",
      "While others might think paying $130,000 to someone who was making a false allegation was hard to fathom, for a wealthy man like Mr. Trump it was not quite “pocket change, but it’s pretty close to it,” Mr. Giuliani said.\n",
      "“When Cohen heard $130,000, he said: ‘My God, this is cheap — they come cheap. Let me get the thing signed up and signed off,’” Mr. Giuliani added.\n",
      "On Fox News, Mr. Giuliani attributed the decision to Mr. Comey’s refusal to publicly exonerate Mr. Trump in the Russia investigation. “He fired Comey because Comey would not, among other things, say that he wasn’t a target of the investigation,” Mr. Giuliani said. Since then, Mr. Mueller’s office has told the White House that Mr. Trump is a subject, though not a target, of the investigation.\n",
      "But some still wondered whether it was an unscripted comment, especially given that it came up almost casually at the end of a long interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News host. Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump have a long and deep relationship. The former mayor has the president’s ear — and understands how to communicate with him — in a way that few others do.\n",
      "Still, Mr. Giuliani is a former big city mayor accustomed to being an executive, and his ability to simply carry out orders without adding his own flair has always been in question.\n",
      "Either way, the last few days have shown that Mr. Trump’s narrative is now at least in part in the hands of others — his lawyers, his friends, his doctor, his accuser’s lawyer, even his investigators. And for a man who prefers to craft his own story line, that is not a comfortable situation.\n",

      "The notice, delivered in September by a conservative advocacy group, is at the heart of an increasingly bitter argument over the seemingly mundane task of keeping accurate lists of voters — an issue that will be a marquee argument before the Supreme Court in January.\n",
      "At a time when gaming the rules of elections has become standard political strategy, the task raises a high-stakes question: Is scrubbing ineligible voters from the rolls worth the effort if it means mistakenly bumping legitimate voters as well?\n",
      "That was the election in which George W. Bush’s 537-vote margin in Florida secured his place in the White House. Controlling the rules of elections — including who is on or off the rolls — has been both a crucial part of political strategy and a legal battleground ever since.\n",
      "Conservative groups and Republican election officials in some states say the poorly maintained rolls invite fraud and meddling by hackers, sap public confidence in elections and make election workers’ jobs harder. Voting rights advocates and most Democratic election officials, in turn, say that the benefits are mostly imaginary, and that the purges are intended to reduce the number of minority, poor and young voters, who are disproportionately Democrats.\n",
      "Mr. Adams is among several conservatives appointed by President Trump to the White House’s Advisory Commission on Voter Integrity, the voter fraud panel mired in a partisan feud over its operations and political intentions.\n",
      "A spokesman for the Public Interest Legal Foundation, Logan Churchwell, said election officials were hobbled by a lack of money and “a failure of imagination.” The law sets few boundaries on tending lists, largely requiring that officials keep voters on the rolls for up to two general elections if they cannot confirm that they have moved. The most explicit prohibitions outlaw striking voters simply because they have not cast ballots and ban delistings within 90 days of elections.\n",
      "Mr. Churchwell said that too many election officials rely on the mail to determine whether people have moved, depending on voters to return postage-paid confirmation requests sent to their last known address. Voters who lose or fail to return them — or sometimes, never get them — are left on the rolls. The 1993 law, he said, did not anticipate a digital world in which the dead and other ineligible voters can be identified more quickly and perhaps more cheaply.\n",
      "Brenda Snipes, the Broward elections supervisor, said the county followed the same procedures as Florida’s other 66 counties in managing voter rolls. “The court record shows thousands and thousands of people that were purged during the time they expressed concern,” she said.\n",
      "Broward has a regimen for verifying the status of centenarians, she said, “but you can’t just suspect that a person may be dead or moved away and remove them from the rolls.”\n",
      "Election officials routinely cull their rolls, but delisting is an exercise fraught with error. Registrants who die in other states — say, New Yorkers who winter in Florida — may pass unnoticed in the states where they are registered.\n",
      "Officials do tap databases kept by state vital records agencies, the Social Security Administration and the Postal Service, which has a change-of-address list. But the databases cannot assure matches; some jurisdictions do not collect personal information like Social Security or driver’s license numbers that could make a positive ID easier.\n",
      "Add to that the vagaries of human error and habit. Clerks make mistakes while typing registration information into computers.\n",
      "In that suit, Ohio officials disenfranchised thousands of eligible voters by requiring all voters who skipped a single election to return a postage-paid form stating whether they had moved. Those who failed to return the form were delisted if they did not vote in the next two elections, even if they were legally still eligible.\n",
      "The Supreme Court, which will hear the case in January, will decide whether the purge violated the Voter Registration Act’s near-total ban on removing registrants because they do not vote. Three of the four conservative advocacy groups have filed briefs supporting Ohio’s purging methods.\n",
      "“The right to vote is too important to treat as a use-it-or-lose-it right,” said Mr. Naifeh of Demos, which represents the plaintiffs in the suit.\n",
      "A federal appeals court struck down the Ohio rule last year. That the Supreme Court decided to rehear the case, some experts say, suggests the justices may be inclined to reverse the lower court ruling. It also underscores the significance of the Republican Senate’s decision to hold open a vacant seat on the court until a Trump administration nominee, a new justice, Neil M. Gorsuch, was able to give conservatives a majority.\n",
      "That said, any ruling is likely to have a fairly limited reach because the debate involves only a technical interpretation of a single clause in the law, said Edward B. Foley, an elections expert at Ohio State University’s law school.\n",
      "Voting rights advocates say the purge efforts fall in partisan line with their other court battles over voting restrictions imposed by Republican governments: amicus briefs supporting partisan gerrymandering in Wisconsin; North Carolina voter restrictions later found to have violated the 14th Amendment and the Voting Rights Act; and a Kansas rule that imposed proof-of-citizenship requirements on new registrations for state elections.\n",
      "Critics also note that the defendants of lawsuits filed by the groups tend to fit a partisan mold. “In a nutshell, they target minority areas and heavily Democratic areas,” said Ms. Snipes of Broward, which is Florida’s bluest county.\n",
      "Mr. Churchwell countered that many of the counties that received notices in September were “blood-red counties that are never going to turn Democrat.”\n",
      "“We’re doing a pretty terrible job toiling away in Iowa and Nebraska,” he said, jokingly.\n",
      "Robert Popper, a former Justice Department lawyer now at Judicial Watch, suggested that the groups’ critics are the ones playing politics. The Voter Registration Act both expands voter registration opportunities and requires that the rolls be culled, he said. While the Obama administration’s Justice Department vigorously enforced the voter registration requirements, he said, the last lawsuit enforcing the culling mandate was litigated in 2007 — by him.\n",
      "The Trump administration’s Justice Department is changing that. It already has backed away from lawsuits against restrictive voting practices. It has asked state election officials for information on what they are doing to keep their rolls up to date.\n",
      "And in August, it filed an amicus brief in the Ohio case before the Supreme Court supporting Ohio’s delisting process — and reversing the Obama Justice Department’s opposition to it.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Investigators working for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, recently asked the White House for documents related to the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, and have questioned witnesses about whether he was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the final months of the presidential campaign, according to people close to the investigation.\n",
      "Though not a formal subpoena, the document request is the first known instance of Mr. Mueller’s team asking the White House to hand over records.\n",
      "In interviews with potential witnesses in recent weeks, prosecutors and F.B.I. agents have spent hours poring over the details of Mr. Flynn’s business dealings with a Turkish-American businessman who worked last year with Mr. Flynn and his consulting business, the Flynn Intel Group.\n",
      "The company was paid $530,000 to run a campaign to discredit an opponent of the Turkish government who has been accused of orchestrating last year’s failed coup in the country.\n",
      "Investigators want to know if the Turkish government was behind those payments — and if the Flynn Intel Group made kickbacks to the businessman, Ekim Alptekin, for helping conceal the source of the money.\n",
      "The line of questioning shows that Mr. Mueller’s inquiry has expanded into a full-fledged examination of Mr. Flynn’s financial dealings, beyond the relatively narrow question of whether he failed to register as a foreign agent or lied about his conversations and business arrangements with Russian officials.\n",
      "President Trump has publicly said Mr. Mueller should confine his investigation to the narrow issue of Russia’s attempts to disrupt last year’s presidential campaign, not conduct an expansive inquiry into the finances of Mr. Trump or his associates.\n",
      "Mr. Flynn declined to comment. Ty Cobb, special counsel to Mr. Trump, said, “We’ve said before we’re collaborating with the special counsel on an ongoing basis.”\n",
      "“It’s full cooperation mode as far as we are concerned,” he said.\n",
      "Investigators are also examining the flow of money into and out of the Flynn Intel Group — a consulting firm Mr. Flynn founded after being forced out as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency — according to several potential witnesses who have been interviewed by prosecutors and F.B.I. agents.\n",
      "Taking money from Turkey or any foreign government is not illegal. But failing to register as a foreign agent is a felony, and trying to hide the source of the money by routing it through a private company or some other entity, and then paying kickbacks to the middleman, could lead to numerous criminal charges, including fraud.\n",
      "Mr. Flynn has now had to file three versions of his financial-disclosure forms. His first version did not disclose payments from Russia-linked companies. He added those payments to an amended version of the forms he submitted in March. This week he filed a new version, adding that he briefly had a contract with SCL Group, the parent company of Cambridge Analytica, a data-mining firm that worked with the Trump campaign.\n",
      "The new forms list at least $1.8 million in income, up from roughly the $1.4 million he had previously reported. It is unclear how much of that money was related to work Mr. Flynn did on Turkey issues.\n",
      "Mr. Flynn’s campaign to discredit the opponent of the Turkish government, Fethullah Gulen, began on Aug. 9 when his firm signed a $600,000 deal with Inovo BV, a Dutch company owned by Mr. Alptekin, the Turkish-American businessman.\n",
      "Mr. Gulen, a reclusive cleric, lives in rural Pennsylvania.\n",
      "The contract with Mr. Alptekin was brought in by Bijan R. Kian, an Iranian-American businessman who was one of Mr. Flynn’s business partners. Mr. Kian, who served until 2011 as a director of the Export-Import Bank, a United States federal agency, is also under scrutiny, according to witnesses questioned by Mr. Mueller’s investigators. A lawyer for Mr. Kian declined to comment.\n",
      "Mr. Mueller’s investigators have asked repeatedly about two payments of $40,000 each that the Flynn Intel Group made to Inovo, said witnesses who have been interviewed in the case.\n",
      "The investigators have indicated that they suspect that the payments were kickbacks, and in one interview pointed to the suspicious timing of the transfers. The first payment back to Inovo was made on Sept. 13, four days after the Dutch company made its first payout under the contract, sending $200,000 to the Flynn Intel Group.\n",
      "On Oct. 11, Inovo paid the Flynn Intel Group an additional $185,000. Then, six days later, the Flynn Intel Group sent $40,000 to Inovo.\n",
      "Mr. Alptekin said that both payments were refunds for work that the Flynn Intel Group had not completed.\n",
      "“Ekim maintains that all payments and refunds were for unfulfilled work, and that they were legal, ethical and above board,” said Molly Toomey, a spokeswoman for Mr. Alptekin. She described the reimbursements as “a business decision.”\n",
      "“Like many Americans rolling up their sleeves in 9/11 to do something, I decided to do something,” Mr. Alptekin said.\n",
      "He scoffed at the suggestion that he was a front for the Turkish government. Inovo, he noted, was registered in the Netherlands, where it is difficult to mask the ownership of a company. A clear paper trail linked the payments between his company and the Flynn Intel Group, he said.\n",
      "“If we were trying to hide,” he said, “you’d think we’d be good at it.”\n",
