      "What started out as a counterintelligence investigation to guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed into a political scandal about what Mr. Trump did, what he said and what he meant by it. Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the F.B.I. director he fired with cascading requests for documents, recordings and hearings.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“It’s important for us in the West to understand that we’re facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons to do us harm,” said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year. “Whatever the domestic politics of this, Comey was spot-on right that Russia is coming after us, but not just the U.S., but the free world in general. And we need to take this seriously.”\n",
      "James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s willingness to discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart. As F.B.I. director, he supervised counterintelligence investigations into computer break-ins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House, and that penetrated deep into the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yet President Barack Obama’s administration did not want to publicize those intrusions, choosing to handle them diplomatically — perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort to manipulate American politics.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s special agents failed to react aggressively to evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee, spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young information-technology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organization’s emails. Only when emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operation.\n",
      "In October, Mr. Comey declined to sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election — not because he doubted the evidence, aides later said, the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem too political so close to Election Day. Now many members of Mr. Obama’s national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlier.\n",
      "And there is no evidence that the Russians have stopped. The N.S.A. suspects that a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has published tools used by the agency to breach foreign computer networks, is a front for Russia, probably the G.R.U., the military intelligence arm.\n",
      "The Homeland Security Department is also looking at new evidence of computer code buried in the electrical power grid. Russia is believed to be behind two major attacks on Ukraine’s grid, and there are warnings that those techniques could also be turned on the United States.\n",

      "The strategy’s central concept, she said, refined in attacks on Eastern European countries, is that it is “better to collapse a country from within.”\n",
      "Eric S. Edelman, who was an under secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, said Russian information warfare capabilities were highly developed. “In the Cold War, the Soviet efforts in this regard were ham-handed and could be countered with relative ease,” he said. “Today, the Russians are much more sophisticated, and they see things like disinformation, propaganda and what we used to call ‘active measures’ as part of a suite of capabilities.”\n",
      "In Washington, however, the issue has become partisan, because Mr. Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy. He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as “fake news” generated by Democrats to explain their defeat.\n",
      "He repeated that during a news conference on Friday. “That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn’t have lost,” he said.\n",
      "A look at what we can glean from the questions James B. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I, would not answer publicly during his testimony before Congress on Thursday.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russia’s role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe. Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday, Mr. Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing to protect against future Russian intervention.\n",
      "“There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever,” Mr. Comey said. “The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that.”\n",
      "He added, “That’s about as un-fake as you can possibly get and is very, very serious.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“What we didn’t talk enough about was the purpose we were there, about Russia’s involvement and Russia’s intent, how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue to keep trying and hitting on us to change how we do business in America, how we elect our officials, the confidence we have in our government,” Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said Friday on “Morning Joe” on MSNBC.\n",
      "Similar warnings have been issued by others in the intelligence community, led by James R. Clapper Jr., who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as director of national intelligence. “I don’t think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing,” he said recently.\n",
      "But few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams — they started a scandal that has consumed the American political process.\n",
      "“They can win two ways,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday. “They can do it” trying to influence votes, “or they can get caught doing it,” and undercut confidence in the American electoral system.\n",

      "MEDIA, Pa. — As Ralph Neary waited for a hot dog outside the Delaware County courthouse here on Wednesday, he chewed over the big surprise out of Washington: President Trump’s firing of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey.\n",
      "Mr. Neary, a 61-year-old county maintenance man, had voted for Mr. Trump and liked his “vision for America.” But now his mind raced back to his youth, and to the dark days of Richard M. Nixon. “Tricky Dick,” Mr. Neary called him, dredging up memories of how Nixon “lied to the American people.”\n",
      "“If it’s found true that President Trump is covering up,” Mr. Neary said flatly, “then I think he should be impeached.”\n",
      "The man serving up his frankfurter, Augie Pantellas, a onetime prizefighter, could not have disagreed more. Mr. Pantellas, 73, said Mr. Comey needed to go, plain and simple, for failing to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton last year in the investigation of her use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n",
      "“I really believe — you might think I’m going overboard — she was probably one of the biggest criminals in American history,” Mr. Pantellas said.\n",
      "Delaware County, like the Philadelphia suburbs as a whole, has trended blue in recent years, but it remains Republican-controlled, and Media itself is steeped in Republican lore: Ronald Reagan rallied supporters here in 1984, and John McCain and Sarah Palin drew throngs in 2008.\n",
      "Trump voters are in abundance in county offices. But among those who crisscrossed the courthouse plaza on Wednesday, roughly as many championed the president’s dismissal of Mr. Comey as were troubled by it.\n",
      "“I think it was long overdue,” Jack Deorio, who works for a security company, said of the dismissal. “If I was Trump, I would have fired him on my first day.”\n",
      "“I was in the military,” Mr. Deorio added, pointing to Mrs. Clinton’s handling of classified information as the real outrage. “If I had done the same thing, I’d have been in Leavenworth.”\n",
      "But Mr. Neary, among others who had voted for Mr. Trump, echoed the criticism of congressional Democrats in saying that the firing suggested an effort to squelch the F.B.I.’s investigation of ties between Russia and the Trump campaign in 2016. The president “is not above the law,” he said. “Once you start lying to the American people, you’re going to finally get caught and nothing good’s going to come of it.”\n",
      "Ken Miniman, 67, a semiretired dentist, said he was having second thoughts about having voted for Mr. Trump. “There’s got to be more to it than meets the eye,” he said. “I believe it may be a cover-up.”\n",
      "James Compton, 70, entering the courthouse wearing a Vietnam veterans ball cap, saw the firing of Mr. Comey as the latest evidence of bipartisan dysfunction.\n",
      "He voted for Mr. Trump, but said an independent prosecutor was in order. “I think that’s where they need to go,” he said. “And go all the way. I think there’s bad stuff all the way.”\n",
      "But Michael J. O’Doherty, an accountant in a pinstripe suit, said Democrats calling for a special prosecutor were just grandstanding. “Chuck Schumer five months ago was basically calling for Comey’s ouster,” Mr. O’Doherty said. He predicted the whole business would blow over, like so many other uproars of the young administration, to be replaced by “whatever topic comes up next week.”\n",
      "DAHLONEGA, Ga. — Dan Dieterle used to keep a cutout of Mr. Trump at his barbecue restaurant here in the north Georgia mountains.\n",
      "The display is gone these days — a friend wanted it for his “man cave” — but Mr. Dieterle’s passion for Mr. Trump has not crested. On Wednesday afternoon, less than 24 hours after the sudden firing of Mr. Comey, Mr. Dieterle was resolute in his support for the president and his decision to oust the F.B.I. director.\n",
      "“I think it’s something that needed to be done,” said Mr. Dieterle, 58. The firing, he said, proved that Mr. Trump was “a man of action, and he’s not afraid to take action.”\n",
      "Mr. Dieterle all but laughed away liberal critics’ argument that Mr. Trump fired Mr. Comey to poison the Russia inquiry.\n",
      "“Do I believe that Donald Trump is in bed with the Russians? Oh, hell no,” he said. “Do I think it’s a lie that’s trying to be perpetrated by the left? Absolutely.”\n",
      "He said he trusted “the powers that be” and the information that fueled the decision to fire Mr. Comey, and expected the next F.B.I. director to have “impeccable character and integrity.”\n",
      "Mr. Dieterle was not alone in Lumpkin County, where Mr. Trump won 78 percent of the vote last fall.\n",
      "“If you have to fire an F.B.I. director, there’s no good time to do it,” said Josh Cagle, the owner of a dry-cleaning shop. He said that former President Barack Obama should have fired Mr. Comey last summer — and that he believed Mrs. Clinton would have fired Mr. Comey if she had been elected.\n",
      "“Either way, he went,” Mr. Cagle said. “I think it was his own fault for getting political. I think he brought it on himself.”\n",
      "At Rusted Buffalo, an eclectic retail shop on the Dahlonega town square, Marie Garrett saw Mr. Comey’s dismissal as a necessary, inevitable product of Mr. Trump’s vow to clean house in Washington.\n",
      "Working one of her three jobs, Ms. Garrett, 40, said she merely wanted familiar figures like Mr. Comey gone from government, no matter Mr. Trump’s rationale.\n",
      "Ms. Garrett, who said she had become more supportive of Mr. Trump since he took office in January, said that some of the president’s backers had expected quicker action to advance his agenda, including his pledge to “drain the swamp.”\n",
      "“People thought it was going to happen immediately, and it hasn’t,” she said. “I feel like he’s losing support. People think it needs to be done right now, right now, right now, and I feel like his supporters were expecting something way sooner.”\n",
      "The dismissal of Mr. Comey, she said, might help.\n",
      "Ms. Garrett said her support for Mr. Trump would not waver.\n",
      "“I’m going to back up him no matter what,” she said. “He’s our president.”\n",
      "She added that she had not given all presidents such backing.\n",
      "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa — Over coffee and rounds of late-morning pinochle, the tables of mostly older, Republican voters in a supermarket cafe here in eastern Iowa were beginning to split on the question of whether the president they had supported was right to abruptly fire his F.B.I. director.\n",
      "“He should have been fired a long time ago,” said Mel Trotter, 76, a Vietnam veteran and former car lot owner who was still angry that the F.B.I. had not supported federal criminal charges against Mrs. Clinton over the email issue.\n",
      "“If he wasn’t doing his job, he should’ve been fired,” said Steve David, 68, a retired bricklayer.\n",
      "But as he nursed a paper cup of coffee, Frank Wagner, 72, a retired industrial worker, represented a potential danger to Mr. Trump’s support, particularly in Iowa, a swing state that flipped into the Republican column after twice voting for Mr. Obama.\n",
      "“I think he is knee-deep in Russia,” Mr. Wagner said about Mr. Trump. “There are too many things that tell you, where there’s smoke, there’s fire.”\n",
      "Mr. Wagner, “a Republican but not a Trump guy,” said he had voted for Mr. Trump and was still glad that Mrs. Clinton was not the president. But he was suspicious of Mr. Trump’s continuing refusal to release his tax returns, and said that firing Mr. Comey had the whiff of an effort to squelch the investigations into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia.\n",
      "Mr. Wagner was unmoved by the Nixonian comparisons drawn by many Democrats. He said that he hadn’t paid much attention to politics during the Watergate era, but that he was dialed in now, adding, “I’d like the truth to come out.”\n",
      "He said Mr. Trump’s bluster was “scary as hell,” and made him concerned about his children and grandchildren, as well as relatives who are the children of immigrants. He said he would not vote for a liberal Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump, but could support a conservative primary challenger, or even a moderate Democrat.\n",
      "“I want to get Donny out,” he said. “I wouldn’t mind if he got kicked out tomorrow — he’s that bad. Once was enough.”\n",
      "Yet Barbara Hames-Bryant, president of a manufactured-home retailer in Marion, Iowa, saw a business owner’s decisiveness at work.\n",
      "“That’s points for Trump,” she said. “Whether Comey is right or wrong, he handled it quickly.”\n",
      "On Wednesday Ms. Hames-Bryant sat in her-ground floor office, her desk cluttered with an obituary, a death certificate and other papers from her father, Troy Hames, who died on April 30 at the age of 92. Her father was a strong supporter of the state’s Republican congressional delegation, she said.\n",
      "She herself was not an early supporter of Mr. Trump, but said she was encouraged by his pro-business posture. Cutting ties with employees or contractors was part of the job, she said, and she gave Mr. Trump credit for what she called an unequivocal break.\n",
      "“People who don’t run a business don’t understand the reality of those decisions,” she said.\n",

      "On a recent night, shopping online for a light jacket or a cotton sweater — some kind of outerwear to guard my body against a springlike breeze — I clicked on the ‘‘new arrivals’’ page of the website of a popular retailer and encountered, unexpectedly, another instance of the complex oddity of race. Here, projecting catalog-model cordiality in the sterile space of an off-white backdrop, was a young black man in a hoodie.\n",
      "On the street, a black guy in a hoodie is just another of the many millions of men and boys dressed in the practical gear of an easygoing era. Or he should be. This is less an analysis than a wish. The electric charge of the isolated image — which provokes a flinch away from thought, a desire to evade the issue by moving on to check the sizing guide — attests to a consciousness of the hoodie’s recent history of peculiar reception. In a cardigan or a crew neck, this model is just another model. In the hoodie, he is a folk demon and a scapegoat, a political symbol and a moving target, and the system of signs that weighs this upon him does not make special distinctions for an Italian cashmere hoodie timelessly designed in heather gray.\n",
      "At the computer, prodded out of the rhythm of browsing, I tried to imagine the meetings that led to this catalog model being placed in this hoodie, in the vacuum of commercial space. Beyond the usual earnest discussion of the styling of his pushed-up sleeves and the asymmetrical dangle of his drawstrings, there had to have been delicate conversations, informed by H.R. policy and P.C. etiquette, straightforward aesthetic concerns and knotty social ones. It is impossible that the production designers were ignorant of the ghost of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed 17-year-old fatally shot four years ago while wearing much the same thing. Did the model present a distraction from the reality on the streets? Did the art director start feeling somehow guilty for even considering such a question? The choice to put the kid in the picture must count as a modest political act, given the rich absurdity of the codes pertaining to a harmless piece of clothing.\n",

      "Which brings you to the transcript of the 911 call made by Trayvon Martin’s killer. Dispatcher: ‘‘Did you see what he was wearing?’’ George Zimmerman: ‘‘Yeah. A dark hoodie, like a gray hoodie.’’ Triv­ial details can bear serious import. Surely there would have been demonstrations after the killing and the killer’s acquittal regardless of what the victim wore. As it happened, those demonstrators — legislators on chamber floors, marchers in the street — picked up the sweatshirt as an emblem, donning hoods in solidarity. Instantly a symbol aggrieved at having to be one, the hoodie was jolted into a curious space: Where the basic hoodie means to defend against the elements, the protest hoodie seeks to offend the right people. In the paranoid view of stodgy shopkeepers, the hoodie is to be feared for extinguishing individuality; in its politicized life, it mutes identity to signal alliance, not unlike a resistance group’s uniform.\n",
      "All that potential subtext is attached to a generally evocative item of clothing. The white working-class hoodie still glows with the Rocky Balboa ideal of grit and tenacity. The yoga-class hoodie is sold on a promise of snuggly virtue that may explain why in Saskatchewan they call the thing a ‘‘bunny hug.’’ The tech-sector hoodie made default by Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg carries on the garment’s proud juvenile tradition of informality and defiance. Once perceived as an affront to professionalism, it has since settled in as a convention.\n",

      "Before my first gig with Bo, I spent a full week of intense preparation, learning and rehearsing his songs. On the opening night, he arrived to the venue five minutes before showtime. As he walked onstage in front of 500 shouting fans, I tried to tell him all the songs I’d prepared. He just looked at me blankly through his Coke-bottle glasses, plugged into his amp and launched into a loud, rhythmic riff on his trademark rectangular guitar. He never bothered to tell me what song we were playing, what chord changes were coming, what key we were in, or anything. But, as every blues and jazz musician knows, that’s how it goes.\n",
      "After the first tune, he realized that I could follow him, and he cryptically shouted, “This monkey is tied, now let’s skin it!”\n",
      "Bo and the other greats I played with often worked this way, and it was a hair-raising on-the-job education. These musicians never told me what was coming next, partly because they didn’t know themselves. They were masters of the art of improvisation.\n",
      "In learning this art, I had to fumble to find the chord we were playing. That usually told me the key signature. Sometimes I could assume a certain chord progression and scale, but not always. Then I had to watch the bandleader like a hawk, for subtle cues — this tilt of the guitar means I solo, that slight bend of the knees means bring the dynamic down, this sudden jerk of the upper body means break. Or stop.\n",
      "Improvising, in music, is the act of composing and performing simultaneously, and it is difficult to master. But it is also universal, and despite the powerful human impulse to plan and program, integral to nearly every aspect of our lives. No matter who you are — a welder, philosopher, a guitarist or a president — you are in some sense simultaneously making the map of your life and following it. It is not an exaggeration to say life itself is one long improvisation.\n",
      "Consider seasoned travelers, for instance. They are typically imperfect communicators, but good improvisers. Talking with a stranger in a language not your own requires the interplay of prepared tools and real-time creativity. The process is filled with awkward gestures, incorrect pronunciations and occasional triumphs. We trust our bodies and muscle memory to succeed where intellectual calculation and semantic memory fail.\n",
      "Improvising is a style of thinking generally. It investigates and helps us come to know the world not by theory but by a method of simulation — observing, listening, acting. I would argue, in fact, that it is the most fundamental form of human cognition, one that must have evolved long before deductive and inductive logic, when the first humans began developing the skills needed for their survival in an untamed environment.\n",
      "In music, at least, improvisation sometimes gets a bad rap, usually from the precincts of classical or other formal Western styles that rely on notation. It is sometimes looked down upon with a “my kid could do that” kind of dismissive attitude. But the ability to improvise is not just “winging it.” It is built on foundations of study and practice that prepare the improviser for the moment of action.\n",
      "The improvisational mind is typically an underappreciated source of wisdom. It can sense subtle unconscious cues in others, and can, in the words of Evans, show a person “a portion of himself that he would not discover otherwise.” Maybe that’s why some of the great blues and jazz improvisers I’ve spent time with seem like roughneck Buddhas. They train first, then create spontaneously. And when they make mistakes, they learn from them. Good improvisation is empathic. It is not just unrehearsed innovation, but apt and fitting contributions to a social or collective project. You cannot improvise well unless you’re a good listener — a fact as true in politics as it is in music.\n",

      "The fired F.B.I. director James B. Comey’s camera manner is more suited for a human-resources video than a reality-show throwdown. But speaking to the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday, live on cable and broadcast news, Mr. Comey demonstrated that he was not there to make friends — at least not with the president who he said fired him because of the investigation into Russian influence on the 2016 election.\n",
      "Mr. Comey opened by calling Donald J. Trump, under oath, a liar. I should distinguish that from merely accusing Mr. Trump of telling a lie. Mr. Comey did that, too: In measured opening remarks, just tinged with anger, he said that the president’s characterizations of him and the F.B.I. were “lies, plain and simple.”\n",
      "But maybe more shockingly, Mr. Comey said that Mr. Trump was a liar to his essence. Mr. Comey had taken detailed notes on their conversations because of “the nature of the person,” he said. “I was honestly concerned that he might lie.”\n",

      "Mr. Trump, after firing Mr. Comey, dismissed him as a “showboat.” Mr. Comey did not exactly cut a flamboyant presence, sitting ramrod straight with a vanilla expression. But there was something of the practiced showman about him — at least within the restrained format of Senate theater.\n",
      "Asked why he should be trusted, he demurred, “My mother raised me not to say things like this about myself, so I’m not going to.” (Which is a way of saying it, of course.) He cast the Russian threat as a bipartisan issue, saying, “They’re coming after America, which I hope we all love equally.” He aimed for aw-gosh earnestness, which the network broadcasts sometimes underlined by framing his head in daytime-drama close-up.\n",
      "Legally, hearings like this are part of a long process. (TV networks aired the Watergate hearings from May to August of 1973.) Politically, they don’t change the fact that the president’s party controls both houses of Congress.\n",
      "Commentators reached back decades for a parallel, both to Watergate and to the Iran-contra hearings. In an odd way, the session also recalled Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas.

      "But thanks to Mr. Trump’s own actions, the cloud darkened considerably on Thursday and now seems likely to hover over his presidency for months, if not years, to come.\n",
      "Rather than relieve the pressure, Mr. Trump’s decision to fire Mr. Comey has generated an even bigger political and legal threat. In his anger at Mr. Comey for refusing to publicly disclose that the president was not personally under investigation, legal experts said, Mr. Trump may have actually made himself the target of an investigation.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n",
      "But Mr. Comey also revealed that he had turned over memos of his conversations with Mr. Trump to that newly appointed special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, suggesting that investigators may now be looking into whether Mr. Trump obstructed justice by dismissing the F.B.I. director.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“This was a devastating day for the Trump White House, and when the history of the Trump presidency is written, this will be seen as a key moment,” said Peter H. Wehner, who was White House adviser to President George W. Bush. “My takeaway is James Comey laid out facts and was essentially encouraging Mueller to investigate Trump for obstruction. That’s a huge deal.”\n",
      "The White House was left in the awkward position of trying to minimize the damage. Mr. Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent, while his advisers kept the daily briefing off camera and sent out the backup to Sean Spicer, the press secretary. “I can definitively say the president is not a liar,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the principal deputy press secretary, told reporters.\n",
      "Washington has not seen a spectacle quite like this since the days of Watergate, Iran-contra or President Bill Clinton’s impeachment. Whatever the controversies under Mr. Bush and President Barack Obama, neither was ever accused of personal misconduct by a current or former law enforcement official in such a public forum.\n",
      "Indeed, Mr. Comey highlighted the difference by noting that he had never taken notes of his conversations with either of those presidents because he trusted their basic integrity, but he did write memos about each of his one-on-one encounters with Mr. Trump because “I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting.”\n",
      "In any other presidency, the events laid out by Mr. Comey — Mr. Trump asking for “loyalty” from the F.B.I. director who was investigating the president’s associates, then asking him to drop an investigation into a former aide and ultimately firing him when he did not — might have spelled the end.\n",
      "But Mr. Trump has tested the boundaries of normal politics and upended the usual rules. To his supporters, the inquiries are nothing more than the elite news media and political establishment attacking a change agent who threatens their interests.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“This is like an explosive presidency-ending moment,” said John Q. Barrett, a law professor at St. John’s University in New York and an associate independent counsel during the Iran-contra investigation in Ronald Reagan’s presidency. “But we have a different context now.”\n",
      "The articles of impeachment drafted against President Richard M. Nixon and Mr. Clinton both alleged obstruction of justice, in effect making clear that such an action could qualify under the “high crimes and misdemeanors” clause of the Constitution. The “smoking gun” tape that doomed Mr. Nixon in 1974 recorded him ordering his chief of staff to have the C.I.A. block the F.B.I. from investigating the Watergate burglary. Critics said that Mr. Trump’s comments to Mr. Comey effectively cut out the middle man.\n",
      "The House impeached Mr. Clinton in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice to cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, during a sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction alleged in Mr. Clinton’s case was persuading Ms. Lewinsky to give false testimony, advising her to hide gifts he had given her to avoid any subpoena and trying to find her a job to keep her happy. After a trial, the Senate acquitted him.\n",
      "As a political matter, both Mr. Nixon and Mr. Clinton faced a House under control of the opposition party, while Mr. Trump has the benefit of a Republican House that would be far less eager to open an impeachment inquiry. And for all of the fireworks on Thursday, the reaction in Congress still broke down largely along partisan lines, with Democrats in attack mode and Republicans either defending Mr. Trump or remaining silent. That may leave the question to Mr. Mueller.\n",
      "“The polarization seems even worse than during the Lewinsky investigation, which I hadn’t thought possible,” said Stephen Bates, an associate independent counsel during the investigation into Mr. Clinton. “Everyone gets judged in terms of helping or hurting Trump. Whatever Mueller does, half of the country will call him courageous and half will call him contemptible. We just don’t know which half is which.”\n",

      "Tellingly, the Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee paid no heed to the talking points distributed in advance by the Republican National Committee at the behest of the White House. Instead of attacking Mr. Comey’s credibility, as the R.N.C. and Donald Trump Jr. did, the Republican senators praised him as a patriot and dedicated public servant.

      "At Berkshire Hathaway Inc's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett credited Apple with developing \"extremely sticky\" products to which consumers become attached and endorsed Apple's decision to buy back its own stock, saying it was the technology company's most productive use of cash.\n",
      "\"We would love to see Apple go down in price,\" Buffett said. Berkshire is now Apple's third largest shareholder, behind Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.\n",
      "\"I'm delighted to see them repurchasing shares,\" Buffett said, just two days after he revealed having bought 75 million additional Apple shares, and four days after Apple said it may repurchase $100 billion of stock. At the end of 2017, Berkshire had owned 165.3 million shares.\n",
      "\"I love the idea of having our 5 percent, or whatever it is, maybe grow to 6 or 7 percent without our laying out a dime.\"\n",
      "And Buffett described it as a mistake that he never thought Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc made sense as investments for Berkshire.\n",
      "Buffett, 87, and his longtime partner and fellow billionaire Charlie Munger, 94, also took pointed questions on China, Wells Fargo & Co, guns, healthcare and their investment choices from shareholders, journalists and analysts at the more-than-six-hour meeting in Omaha, Nebraska.\n",
      "The questions also elicited views on politics from the \"Oracle of Omaha\" and Munger.\n",
      "Buffett said it was unlikely that the United States and China would come to loggerheads on trade and believed the countries would avoid doing \"something extremely foolish.\"\n",
      "\"The United States and China are going to be the two superpowers of the world, economically and in other ways, for a long, long, long time,\" Buffett said, and that any tensions should not jeopardize the win-win benefits from trade.\n",
      "\"It is just too big and too obvious ... that the benefits are huge and the world is dependent on it in a major way for its progress, that two intelligent countries (would) do something extremely foolish,\" he said. \"We both may do things that are mildly foolish from time to time.\"\n",
      "The Trump administration has drawn a hard line in trade talks with Beijing, demanding a $200 billion cut in the Chinese trade surplus with the United States, sharply lower tariffs and advanced technology subsidies, people familiar with the talks said on Friday.\n",
      "Buffett suggested U.S. President Donald Trump should be an \"educator-in-chief\" on the invisible benefits of trade.\n",
      "Munger, meanwhile, answered a question on steel tariffs imposed by the White House by acknowledging that U.S. producers are hurting.\n",

      "Asked why Buffett was willing to do business with gun makers, he retorted, \"I do not believe in imposing my political opinions on the activities of our businesses.\"\n",
      "The billionaire investor said U.S. corporate tax cuts were good for shareholders but cautioned that the long-term effects of economic choices could be hard to gauge.\n",
      "And Buffett predicted \"bad endings\" for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, and said long-term U.S. government bonds were a terrible investment because inflation would consume their returns.\n",
      "CARDINAL SIN\n",
      "Buffett defended Wells Fargo and its chief executive, Tim Sloan, when asked when Berkshire would ditch the bank, one of its largest common stock holdings. Many shareholders applauded the question.\n",
      "Buffett said the bank had committed the \"cardinal sin\" of incentivizing employees into \"kind of crazy conduct.\" U.S. regulators imposed $1 billion of fines last month over lending abuses.\n",
      "But he maintained that the bank was not \"inferior,\" as an investment or morally, to its main rivals.\n",
      "Berkshire owned $25.2 billion of Wells Fargo stock as of March 31, down 14 percent from year end as a series of scandals weighed on the bank's reputation.\n",
      "Wells Fargo investors last week gave strong backing to the bank's directors and executives on Tuesday, indicating confidence in its overhauled leadership to rebound.\n",
      "Buffett addressed his alliance with another banker, JPMorgan Chase & Co's Jamie Dimon, and Amazon's Jeff Bezos to tackle healthcare. Buffett said U.S. healthcare costs are a tapeworm on the economy, and he said the venture partners expect to name a chief executive within a couple months.\n",
      "CASH STOCKPILE\n",
      "Buffett faces a challenge investing Berkshire's more than $108 billion of cash and equivalents, including for acquisitions, saying his \"phone is not ringing off the hook with good deals.\"\n",
      "Shortly before the meeting, Berkshire ended its more than year-long stretch of falling operating profit, while a new accounting rule caused the conglomerate chaired by Warren Buffett to suffer an overall net loss. Buffett said the net results were not representative of the business.\n",
      "The accounting change required Berkshire to report unrealized losses in its equity portfolio, which totaled $170.5 billion at year end, regardless of whether it planned to sell those stocks.\n",
      "Berkshire's net loss was $1.14 billion, compared with profit of $4.06 billion a year earlier.\n",
      "But operating profit, which excludes investment and derivative gains and losses, rose 49 percent to a record $5.29 billion, or about $3,215 per Class A share, higher than the $3,116 per share analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.\n",
      "GIDDY SHAREHOLDERS\n",
      "Shareholders have been enthusiastic about Berkshire, which sent out slightly more tickets to this year's extravaganza than in 2015, when an estimated 42,000 celebrated Buffett's 50th year at the helm. An even larger audience likely watched online via Yahoo Finance.\n",

      "In the present day, Al and Earn have come to a crossroads. Al’s ready to level up in his career and Earn is little more than dead weight.\n",
      "“FUBU” offers the first substantial glimpse into their past, revealing that Al has a decades-old history of carrying his cousin.\n",
      "This week, we’re flashing back to the late ’90s, where a teenage Earn is stuck shopping with his mother. As any bored kid would do, he wanders off to explore something more interesting than down market home décor (though he’s a little long in the tooth for playfully plowing through the racks the way he does). He can’t believe his luck when he stumbles upon a neon yellow FUBU jersey, a rare hip-hop fashion find amid the store’s non-designer dreck.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "He arrives at school to a chorus of exactly the kind of external validation he’d been craving. More than just impressing his peers, he manages to get a smile and a compliment from his crush, an epic feat for a teen who hasn’t yet infiltrated the in-crowd.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "While Earn’s stewing in his anxiety — because he knows his is the likely counterfeit — his cousin is in the principal’s office, keeping calm in the face of weighty allegations.\n",
      "“Do you know why you’re here today, Alfred?” the principal asks.\n",
      "“Racism,” Al says nonchalantly. “Not everybody’s gonna like me.”\n",
      "A fellow student has accused him of stealing, but the charge is small stuff that Al refuses to sweat. He knows exactly which loophole to exploit in order to avoid punishment and gets off the hook with ease. From this we learn three things: Even in his youth, Al was plain-spoken and blunt; he’s a veteran at hustling contraband; and he’s long-since figured out the system and his role in it.\n",
      "Earn possesses none of this prowess and that’s why his day continues to be a stomach-churner. Even as he’s flexing his brain power in biology class (“You’re pretty smart,” his cute female lab partner tells him), he shows he’s clueless when it comes to maneuvering the school’s social minefields.\n",
      "“If it’s fake, everybody’s gonna roast me … forever,” he says to a friend, dreading the cruel nicknames he’ll have to endure.\n",
      "Being white and, thus, not beholden to the same code of cultural conduct, the friend simply shrugs and says, “It doesn’t seem like a big deal to me. I’ve worn this shirt twice this week.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Everyone else seems fixated on Earn’s designer drama, from the object of his affection to upperclassmen to cafeteria workers. FUBU got its start by promoting a sense of black unity — it’s an acronym for “For Us, By Us” — but that message fell on deaf ears here. Earn’s peers were determined to delineate between the haves and have-nots and in order to protect himself from being outed as the latter, he needed that name-brand as armor.\n",
      "And when a single loose thread threatened to unravel everything, he turned to Alfred for counsel.\n",
      "“I’m not cool like you,” Earn says, scanning the hallway for oncoming tormentors. (He tells Al the shirt came from the sale rack at Marshalls, though it looked more like a secondhand store than a discount retailer.) “What should I do? I’m freakin’ out!”\n",
      "“Confidence is key,” he tells him.\n",

      "Which is when Al comes to his rescue, flipping the script on Johnny’s ruling with some of that aforementioned confidence (as well as a little racism).\n",
      "“Of course this fool’s gonna say ‘Made in China.’ He’s Chinese,” Al says. It’s sound enough reasoning for the easily-swayed crowd and they set off hazing Devon relentlessly. (“I’m not Chinese, I’m Filipino,” Johnny clarifies, but no one cares.)\n",
      "There’s no heartwarming family-bonding moment afterward. In fact, the cousins barely even share a glance after this entire exchange. Earn simply slinks off to the school bus, gray hoodie zipped all the way to the top, and watches silently as Devon takes a heaping helping of undeserved humiliation.\n",
      "The next day, it’s revealed that Devon committed suicide. In addition to the hazing, he’d been coping with his parents’ divorce; the combination proved too much for him to bear. The class clown stifles a giggle, the biology teacher holds back tears and Earn just sits there wordlessly blinking, a habit he’s kept up over the years.\n",
      "He arrives home to a concerned mother and aunt, who’ve heard about the death. As they clip coupons, they rattle off life advice to him and Al, who’s watching TV in the next room.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“People will bully you your whole life, if you let ‘em,” Al’s mother says. “You gotta stand up for yourself.”\n",
      "“You and your cousin gotta look out for each other,” Earn’s mother adds.\n",
      "As it turns out, they’ve been bound to this advice for too long and, lately, it’s been to Al’s detriment. Earn has spent years faking it, but has yet to make it. And now, seeing how long Al has had his back, it’s clear why he was reluctant to work with Earn in the first place and is eager to finally shake him off.\n",
      "• It’s surprising to learn that Al was enrolled in JROTC. He doesn’t seem the type to go in for all the program’s rules and rigorousness.\n",
      "• We need a Denisha minisode. The auxiliary bio class character’s 180-degree turn from being despondent and combative to vivacious and overeager deserves a story of its own.\n",
      "• You are a black man in America. And when you meet people, you need to look good,” Earn’s mom cautions, instructing him to wear a suit at his upcoming piano lesson. “Your clothes are important.” Between school and home, he’s getting two different takes on respectability politics.\n",
      "• A morbid hot take: Though he may have lost the taste for it by now, the coast is probably clear for Earn to wear that second FUBU shirt his mother picked up for him.\n",

      "HBO should be riding high.\n",
      "And yet, the premium cable channel is confronting two major headaches that have turned what should be a triumphant summer into an exhausting one.\n",
      "Roughly two weeks ago, a hacker began releasing material stolen from HBO in a cyberattack. On Sunday, another wave of material was released, including unaired episodes of two anticipated fall series, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “The Deuce.” Though the material that has come out so far has not been damaging to HBO — there have been no embarrassing emails like there were in the attack that hit Sony in 2014 — it has certainly been an irritant that has shown no sign of fading.\n",
      "And this weekend’s deadly rallies in Charlottesville, Va., also served to remind HBO that the public outcry over its recent announcement of a new alternate-history drama called “Confederate” may linger for some time.\n",
      "All of this is happening as HBO’s parent company, Time Warner, is on the brink of a merger with AT&T.\n",
      "A backlash emerged, with some accusing HBO of being cavalier with the topic of slavery and the contemporary plight of black life in the United States. A social media campaign built around the hashtag #NoConfederate began trending on Twitter.\n",
      "Then came this weekend’s events in Charlottesville, where a rally of white nationalists turned into a series a melees and a 32-year-old woman was killed when a car sped into a crowd of counterprotestors.\n",
      "One of the creators of the #NoConfederate campaign, April Reign, who also created the #OscarsSoWhite social media campaign, said that the events over the weekend were a reminder that “we have not fully reconciled what the Confederacy means.”\n",
      "“How is this an alt-history when we have things like Charlottesville playing out?” she said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "HBO defended the series in a statement on Monday.\n",
      "“We support everybody’s right to express an opinion but the suggestion of irresponsibility on our part is simply undeserved,” the network said. “HBO has a long history of championing intelligent storytelling and we will approach this project with the same level of thoughtfulness that has always defined our programming. We recognize the sensitivity of this project and will treat it with the respect that it deserves. Our creative partners should be given time to develop the series rather than face prejudgment.”\n",
      "HBO said that “Confederate” would not go into production until “Game of Thrones” was finished next year, meaning that it will probably be at least two years before the show is ready to air.\n",
      "The hacker, who refers to himself as Mr. Smith, described this as the “third wave” of material. So far, the attack has remained relatively contained compared with the one involving Sony, which included a trove of embarrassing and racially insensitive emails that forced the studio’s executives to publicly apologize and meet with civil rights activists. HBO has said that it did not believe its email system “as a whole” had been breached, though the hacker has had access to some emails and released a number from the account of one network executive.\n",
      "In contrast, the HBO hacker has primarily released the material to members of the news media, and it is not clear how widely some of the hacked episodes have actually spread online. Further, the hacker has not released any upcoming episodes of “Game of Thrones,” HBO’s crown jewel, which has two episodes left this season.\n",
      "Mr. Smith has said that he wants HBO to pay him a ransom for the rest of the material. On Monday, the hacker provided a copy of a letter that he had purportedly sent to HBO. “You disappointed us, so we will bring down your nasty empire,” it read.\n",
      "HBO said in a statement that it was no longer in communication with the hacker, and that it would not comment on every bit of material that was released.\n",
      "“The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention,” the network said. “That’s a game we’re not going to participate in. Obviously, no company wants their proprietary information stolen and released on the internet. Transparency with our employees, partners, and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward. This incident has not deterred us from ensuring HBO continues to do what we do best.”\n",

      "The most compelling photographs of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity.\n",
      "African-American newspapers and magazines routinely reported on the details of his life and activism through pictures, years before mainstream publications. And those mass media outlets — though at first circumspect and, in Dr. King’s final years, increasingly critical as he turned his attention to poverty, war and racism outside the South — nevertheless produced a visual narrative that helped transform a regional movement into a national one.\n",
      "If the news media sometimes vilified Dr. King, it also contributed to the mythic view of him as the charismatic leader “who single-handedly directed the course of the civil rights movement through the force of his oratory,” as the historian Clayborne Carson wrote of his distorted legacy. In that, photos became as powerful as words as Dr. King was transformed from a human being into a visual symbol of courage, fortitude, or benevolence: The stoic cleric posing for a mug shot after being arrested during the Montgomery bus boycott, or the consummate family man to whom white Americans could better relate.\n",
      "If he was for many white people the standard-bearer of a black America that was otherwise unknown to them, the news media’s mythic imagery rendered Dr. King enigmatic. He had become, in contexts both positive and negative, the pre-eminent but two-dimensional icon of a political struggle that involved thousands of organizers, activists and sympathizers. By contrast, the most compelling photographs of him were neither idealized nor simplistic, but endeavored to portray his complexity and humanity.\n",
      "James Karales’s candid picture of Dr. King at the kitchen table, talking with his young daughter Yolanda, for example, reminds us that the lives of black Americans, no matter how famous, were inevitably fraught. Disappointment registering on his face, he was explaining to the child, for the first time, the perils of segregation and why she could not visit a restricted amusement park. A photograph of the civil rights leader in intense conversation with President Lyndon B. Johnson affirmed that he was not simply an activist clergyman, but also a tough negotiator adept at politics.\n",
      "What is perhaps most extraordinary about Dr. King and photography is not how the medium defined him, but how skillfully he used it to define the story of civil rights. He was a visual tactician who, along with his advisers, understood the power of the camera to expose the brutality and injustice of segregation.\n",
      "The historic “Children’s Crusade” in Birmingham, Ala., in May 1963, for example, was largely organized for the camera. Dr. King and his strategists recognized the need for pictures that would demonstrate the depravity of Jim Crow segregation to a skeptical public. Anticipating a fierce response from Bull Connor, the city’s segregationist commissioner of public safety, and aware of the media’s hunger for provocative images, they planned a nonviolent demonstration of more than a thousand schoolchildren.\n",
      "“I always saw Martin Luther King Jr. as this incredible spiritual leader, who spoke in a way that inspired people in emotional tones,” said the photographer Steve Schapiro of his famous subject. “What you don’t realize is that people are human at the same time. You can be a leader and still have your own particular worries.”\n",
      "Race Stories is a continuing exploration of the relationship between race and photographic depictions of race by Maurice Berger. He is a research professor and chief curator at the Center for Art, Design and Visual Culture at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.\n",

If you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate New York, or eastern Kentucky, or my own native West Texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy — which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog— you will come to an awful realization. It wasn’t Beijing. It wasn’t even Washington, as bad as Washington can be.\n",
      "Less well-off white voters have only themselves to blame, Williamson continues:\n",
      "It wasn’t immigrants from Mexico, excessive and problematic as our current immigration levels are. It wasn’t any of that. Nothing happened to them. There wasn’t some awful disaster. There wasn’t a war or a famine or a plague or a foreign occupation. Even the economic changes of the past few decades do very little to explain the dysfunction and negligence — and the incomprehensible malice — of poor white America.\n",
      "Not satisfied to stop there, Williamson adds:\n",
      "The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets. Morally, they are indefensible. Forget all your cheap theatrical Bruce Springsteen crap. Forget your sanctimony about struggling Rust Belt factory towns and your conspiracy theories about the wily Orientals stealing our jobs.\n",
      "Finally, determined to blow a hole in the Trump hot air balloon, the columnist hits hard:\n",
      "The white American underclass is in thrall to a vicious, selfish culture whose main products are misery and used heroin needles. Donald Trump’s speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin. What they need isn’t analgesics, literal or political. They need real opportunity, which means that they need real change, which means that they need U-Haul.\n",
      "Williamson’s bitterness over the refusal of Trump’s supporters to get in line behind a more acceptable candidate is echoed across the right.\n",
      "I grew up in Kentucky, live in a rural county in Tennessee, and have seen the challenges of the white working-class first-hand. Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isn’t putting a bottle in their hand. Immigrants aren’t making them cheat on their wives or snort OxyContin. Obama isn’t walking them into the lawyer’s office to force them to file a bogus disability claim.\n",
      "GOOD NEWS! Buchanan Says If Ted Cruz Wins, An “Awful Lot” of Trump Supporters Will “Just Go Home”\n",
      "The “new Trump voters,” Howe writes,\n",
      "aren’t motivated by what makes the Republican Party the Republican Party. They aren’t in this to limit the size and scope of government. They aren’t coming out to Trump rallies because he’s talking about reducing the debt.\n",
      "If Trump is not nominated and his supporters stay home on Election Day, Howe believes that “there’s really only one response: Bye.”\n",
      "We’re not living our Christian faith because no Christian, no real Christian — I don’t mean a judgmental Christian, I mean somebody who’s living their faith — no Christian says, “I want that guy, that guy is the guy for me.”\n",
      "America’s self-appointed best and brightest uniformly view the passions unleashed by Trump as the modern-day equivalent of a medieval peasants’ revolt. And, like their medieval forebears, they mean to crush it. That effort is both a fool’s errand for the country and a poisoned chalice for conservatives and Republicans.\n",
      "In Olsen’s view, disparaging Trump’s lower-income white supporters “will simply intensify the masses’ rage and ensure that their political spokesmen become more intransigent and radical.” Even worse,\n",
      "keeping blue-collar white Americans out of political power will result in exactly what Washington elites have wanted for years: a series of grand bargains that keep the status quo largely intact and the Democratic party in power.\n",
      "Only now are major party leaders and contributors beginning to recognize the full depth of this intraparty conflict.\n",
      "The history, Confessore wrote, is\n",
      "one of a party elite that abandoned its most faithful voters, blue-collar white Americans, who faced economic pain and uncertainty over the past decade as the party’s donors, lawmakers and lobbyists prospered. From mobile home parks in Florida and factory towns in Michigan, to Virginia’s coal country, where as many as one in five adults live on Social Security disability payments, disenchanted Republican voters lost faith in the agenda of their party’s leaders.\n",
      "While white voters with a high school degree or less have steadily declined as a share of the electorate — from 82 percent of adults 25 and older in 1940 to 29 percent in 2007 — they have repeatedly played a crucial role in determining the outcome of elections.\n",
      "These two elections marked the establishment of a conservative majority that produced Republican presidential victories in 1980, 1984 and 1988 — the only exception being 1976 when Watergate briefly stalled the ascendance of the right.\n",
      "The challenges facing the white working class are indeed severe. According to Teixeira and Abramowitz:\n",
      "Between 1979 and 2005, the average real hourly wage for those with a college degree went up 22 percent and for those with advanced degrees, 28 percent. In contrast, average wages for those with only some college went up a mere 3 percent, actually fell 2 percent for those with a high school diploma, and for high school dropouts, declined a stunning 18 percent.\n",
      "The accompanying chart, based on an analysis by the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies, illustrates aggregated exit poll data from the Republican primaries held through March 21. It shows the demographic groups that have provided Trump with relatively high and relatively low levels of support.\n",
      "The comparatively low levels of support for Trump among college-educated Republicans, women, young voters and those with incomes above $100,000 suggest that these voters are most likely to sit out the election or to vote Democratic if Trump is the nominee. Conversely, groups that gave him higher than average support in the primaries — the less well educated, those with incomes below the median, men and rural voters — are likely to deliver his best margins in the general election.\n",
      "If there are two key themes in the election so far, one is Trump’s ability to enrage; the other is his ability to exceed expectations. The disregard of liberal and conservative elites for working and middle class voters has manifested itself in a consistent underestimation of the anger, resentment and pessimism of these voters — and hence of their electoral power.\n",
      "The primaries have demonstrated the importance of the primary process in making unheard voices audible.\n",
      "In the former,\n",
      "millions of people have the milk of prosperity and the honey of equality flowing before them. This America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies, culture and education for their minds, freedom and human dignity for their spirits.\n",
      "The latter, the “other America,” has\n",

      "Emily Bazelon, a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the Truman Capote Fellow at Yale Law School, and Elizabeth Goitein, the co-director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan center, watched James B. Comey’s testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee today, where the former F.B.I. director discussed the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.\n",
      "Moving forward, if this hearing is any indication, Trump’s defenders will be trying to portray Trump’s pressuring Comey to drop the Flynn investigation as an isolated incident, a president who simply didn’t know any better going a bit too far trying to get a friend off the hook. It will be up to lawmakers, journalists and others to keep the focus on the bigger picture and keep pushing for answers on the nature of Trump associates’ ties to Russia.\n",
      "But let’s take a real step back to the very beginning: Last summer and fall, a hostile foreign power used hackers to try to get a candidate, Donald Trump, elected. The F.B.I. determined there was sufficient evidence that Trump’s campaign colluded with Russia in this effort to open an investigation, which continues to this day. The president asked Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to pledge his loyalty and to shut down one part of the investigation. When the director didn’t comply, he was fired. And the intelligence committee hearing on all of this proceeded like it was just another partisan fight about tax cuts. The word “surreal” comes to mind.\n",
      "The full conversation that they had during the hearing is below:\n",
      "Of course, the key questions going into today were all about influence, and pressure, and how much of each the president can legitimately exert over the F.B.I. director who was investigating his campaign and key players in his administration.\n",
      "Liza, what did we learn from the released statement yesterday that mattered most? I saw Trump’s defenders and critics both doubling down. Is that because we are in a grey area in which we see the president tromping all over norms of F.B.I. and Justice Department independence, without necessarily seeing clear, indictable proof of the crime of obstruction of justice? Or is that the wrong standard, since what matters is the political bar for obstruction, which means it’s up to Congress? It seems as if these shouldn’t be partisan questions. Yet they are.\n",
      "“There’s no serious argument that this is appropriate behavior from an American president. Imagine for a moment testimony that President Barack Obama or a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton had a similar conversation with an F.B.I. director. The entire conservative-media world would erupt in outrage, and rightly so. The F.B.I. director is a law-enforcement officer, loyal to the Constitution, not the president’s consigliere.”\n",
      "Comey said he had no regrets about his decision, last July and October, to publicly discuss the F.B.I.’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s private email server. What he did broke with Justice Department practice. Democrats have intensely criticized him for it.\n",
      "I don’t really think Trump was drawing conclusions in the way that Lowry implies. It seems more likely that the president was just trying to get what he wanted. But is there something to the underlying idea, that Comey himself scrambled the rules for what should and shouldn’t be public, in the context of a highly politicized F.B.I. investigation?\n",
      "And by the way, how telling is it that the former director of the F.B.I. testified that he felt he needed to document every encounter with Trump because, given “the nature of the person,” he felt Trump might lie? He actually used the “L” word! It’s a relief to hear, after listening to all the tortured synonyms reporters come up with to try to avoid calling it what it is. It’s not just a personal foible, and acknowledging it isn’t an ad hominem attack. When the president lies, it undermines the workings of democracy.\n",
      "Trump is right about the “cloud” hanging over him. Comey set a bad precedent last summer and I hope the F.B.I. ditches it. Though with Washington leaking like a sieve, it’s very hard to imagine how the agency could start investigating Trump personally and keep it a secret. But really, it’s for Congress — in particular the Senate Intelligence Committee —to give a public accounting.\n",
      "But moving on, we’ve repeatedly heard suggestions today that if Trump was only trying to get the F.B.I. to back off from one person, Flynn, that’s not a big problem. But of course it is! For one thing, we have no idea how central Flynn might be to the larger Russia investigation (as I mentioned before). Even more important, this goes to the heart of one of the most dangerous attributes of this president: His lack of respect for the rule of law.\n",

      "Walmart customers looking to toss the latest issue of Cosmopolitan magazine into their shopping carts will have to search the superstore a little harder.\n",
      "The retailer has decided to remove the magazine from its checkout aisle displays in its 5,000-plus stores in the United States, in a move announced by a nonprofit anti-pornography group that connected the company’s decision to the #MeToo movement.\n",
      "The magazines will be placed on racks elsewhere, varying by store. The April issue features Cardi B, the reality star turned rapper, who gives an “uncensored and totally amazing” interview inside. Other headlines promise tips on sex toys and foreplay, the secrets of super-close couples and this teaser: “Could you be guilty of micro-cheating? Could he?”\n",
      "Walmart, in a statement, acknowledged that “the concerns raised were heard” but said that its decision stemmed from business reasons.\n",
      "“As with all products in our store, we continue to evaluate our assortment and make changes,” the statement said. When asked for further comment, Walmart indicated that there are a number of factors it evaluates when making in-store placement decisions, including customer feedback and sales data.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, an advocacy group that has campaigned against what it calls Cosmopolitan’s “hyper-sexualized and sexually objectifying” content, took some credit for the move on Tuesday, citing its “collaborative dialogue” with Walmart.\n",
      "“This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture,” said Dawn Hawkins, the group’s executive director, in a statement.\n",

      "“We are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues,” he said in a statement.\n",

      "Ms. Hearst, who now runs a “Cosmo Hurts Kids” campaign aimed at stopping the sale of the magazine to children under 18, was not involved in the center’s current push, according to according to Haley Halverson, the organization’s vice president for advocacy and outreach.\n",
      "The group, which was founded in 1962 and was previously known as Morality in Media, has continued to focus on Cosmopolitan in part, Ms. Halverson said, because the magazine was “targeting young girls” with its messaging.\n",
      "“A young teenager who first picks up Cosmo is going to be attracted to the bubble gum pink cover and to stories about Selena Gomez and One Direction,” Ms. Halverson said. “But within the covers, Cosmo is filled with extremely explicit articles that detail things like sexting, pornography, group sex, public sex and other forms of risky sex that actually a lot of young girls today are being pressured to do before they’re ready.”\n",
      "Ms. Halverson also said the group viewed its efforts as especially important in the midst of the continuing conversation around sexual harassment that was sparked by the #MeToo movement.\n",
      "“Cosmopolitan really likes to wrap itself up in its faux feminist mystique where they’re claiming that because they’re talking about sex, it’s liberating to women,” she said. “But it’s time to raise the level of discourse and say, ‘Well, are they talking about sex in an actually empowering or productive way?’”\n",
      "When asked, Ms. Halverson could not think of an example of a publication or media organization discussing sexuality in the manner she described.\n",
      "John Harrington, a publishing industry consultant who until 2015 published a newsletter covering the magazine business, linked Walmart’s decision to larger trends. As magazine sales continue to decline, Mr. Harrington said, it was likely that Cosmopolitan’s sales at Walmart were following that trend.\n",
      "But he also said that the retailer historically had appeared more responsive than other retailers to pressure from outside groups.\n",
      "In the past, “they have occasionally moved magazines like Cosmopolitan and Glamour on an issue-by-issue basis,” Mr. Harrington said.\n",

      "Donald Trump has a boatload of problems. Ann Coulter, the author of a 2016 book titled “In Trump We Trust,” is now one of them.\n",
      "A week ago, when he signed a $1.3 trillion spending bill with nothing for his promised border wall, her frustrations with him, expressed frequently in her syndicated columns, turned into fury. “Congratulations, President Schumer!” she tweeted to more than 1.9 million followers. She also fantasized on Twitter about his impeachment.\n",
      "During an appearance at Columbia University on Tuesday night, she referred to him as a “shallow, lazy ignoramus.” And during a long conversation with me at The Times on Thursday afternoon, she sent him a warning about the wrath he’d face if the wall doesn’t rise: “The Former Trumpers should keep Donald Trump awake at night.”\n",
      "Coulter isn’t just any Trump critic. She was one of his earliest, most prominent — and fiercest — advocates. He came down that escalator and ranted about Mexican rapists and she swooned. Understandably: His diatribes against immigrants were cribbed from her 2015 best seller, “¡Adios, America!: The Left’s Plan to Turn Our Country into a Third World Hellhole.” It was published around the time of his campaign announcement. She had sent him an advance copy.\n",
      "So Coulter was Trump’s muse. She was also his oracle, predicting his nomination and election back when most others still dismissed him as a joke. And she’s a barometer of, and tribune for, some of his core supporters, including her good friend Matt Drudge.\n",
      "It’s for that reason that I pressed her to visit The Times. We spoke for about an hour. We could have clashed over an array of issues and recent statements of hers. But the agenda was her relationship with Trump and his political bind: He is pleasing neither her nor swing voters in the suburbs. That has implications not just for 2020 but also for the November midterms.\n",
      "Her agreement to talk hinged in part on our history. I have been discussing politics with her for almost two decades. I remember vividly a dinner in early 2016 when she laid out for me how Trump would prevail. She mentioned Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania. I thought she was delusional. Then came Nov. 8.\n",
      "What follows is a condensed and edited transcript of our conversation.\n",
      "But something switched Nov. 8. Suddenly it was: “Please like me, Goldman Sachs.”\n",
      "Immigration should be a bipartisan issue. I wish Trump would give something like a fireside chat. That’s what he should have done the day of his inauguration: Sit in the Oval Office and say, perfectly somberly and kindly: “I said some wild things during the campaign, it sounds like it’s divisive and angry, but now we need to bring the country together. We can disagree on other things, but one thing that ought to unite us is that we want to protect the people already here.” It’s a perfectly bipartisan issue.\n",
      "“¡Adios, America!” came out two weeks before Trump came down the escalator. The book hadn’t even come out yet and I get an email from one of Trump’s people saying, “Mr. Trump would like a copy of your book.” I Fedexed it to his office. I have avoided seeking or requesting credit on this. His instincts were very good. I think he should take credit. His instincts are amazing.\n",
      "I’ve met Jared. He’s very nice. But if a relative of mine suddenly bought Ivanka’s fashion company, I wouldn’t demand to be the one put in charge of designing the clothes and figuring out if they are going to be made in Macau or India. Not my area of expertise.\n",
      "There were all these rumors about how he was bringing his kids. They were there during the transition. Wait a second. A, they know nothing about politics. B, as far as we know, to this moment, they’ve been liberal Democrats. They’re very nice people but Bobby Kennedy was a nice person — and he knew a little bit more about politics — and when J.F.K. made Bobby his attorney general, the press pulled its nose out of J.F.K.’s butt just long enough to criticize him for that. We don’t like nepotism. We’re Americans. This is third-world behavior. Which is what I told the president.\n",
      "If he doesn’t have us anymore — that’s what he should be worried about, because, you play those people for suckers? The ones who stood by him through thick and thin and thought this was finally something different? Former Trumpers should put the fear of God in him.\n",

      "The gala’s planning committee first invited the band to play in 2009 for the inauguration of President Obama, and then again in 2013 for Mr. Obama’s re-election. B Street was such a hit that the gala organizers signed a contract in 2015 with the band to play this year — before Mr. Trump even announced his bid for the presidency.\n",
      "The band had no idea at the time that it would be playing at a Trump celebration, but that has not stopped Springsteen fans from voicing displeasure: They sent “several hundred” angry emails about the gig to B Street’s founder and keyboardist, Willie Forte, he said in an interview on Thursday.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I never saw this coming — this part coming,” Mr. Forte said of the uproar. “Are you asking me if, you know, if I would’ve reconsidered if I could go back in the beginning and I knew this was going to happen? Sure.”\n",

      "Mr. Forte said that he and his bandmates would cancel the performance if Mr. Springsteen asked them to but that they had not heard from his team, “thank God, so far.”\n",
      "He said B Street was not “a political band,” but rather played out of a love for the Garden State and to pay tribute to Mr. Springsteen, a man some might call the king of New Jersey.\n",
      "“I’ve gotten pushback from Springsteen fans that don’t know the reputation of our band or have never seen the band or talked to any of us,” Mr. Forte said.\n",
      "Organizers of the gala staunchly defended the band’s participation.\n",
      "“Springsteen music is magic to the ears of our New Jersey members and guests, regardless of party,” Nancy Blades Fatemi, executive director of the New Jersey State Society, which holds the gala, said in a statement. “It’s like, when you look at a Rembrandt or read Shakespeare, do you care what their politics were?\n",
      "“You can’t have an inaugural ball with a Jersey Shore boardwalk theme and not have great Jersey music,” she said. “Either the band or the D.J. will be playing Springsteen, Four Seasons, Frank Sinatra, the music legends that make us proud as New Jerseyans.”\n",
      "Ms. Fatemi also said of B Street, “We consider them the official band of the New Jersey State Society and would not consider any other group.”\n",
      "The band formed in 1980 as Backstreets but changed its name to B Street after a lawsuit over the name in the late ’80s, Mr. Forte said. The band has performed Mr. Springsteen’s music thousands of times, according to Mr. Forte, including at Mr. Christie’s first inauguration as governor. Mr. Christie is an avowed Springsteen fan, even if he is on the opposite side of the political spectrum.\n",

      "“I am not a member of any organized party — I am a Democrat,” Will Rogers said more than 80 years ago. His words still have a ring of truth. If Democrats are to retake control of one or both houses of Congress (and ultimately the White House), they must work together, even if they do not always agree on particular issues.\n",
      "Democrats can unify on a number of principles: a) We are the party of Main Street, not of Wall Street. b) Honest government is essential. c) Government should promote change to benefit ordinary Americans before the rich. d) A humane immigration policy is right. e) We do not yet have full equality among our citizens, but that is a goal we should pursue.\n",
      "A party expressing such values can appeal to a large majority of our citizens, and speak for them against the forces that have degraded the nation in so many ways.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Democrats should fight dirty, play dirty, beg, borrow, steal, do whatever it takes. “When they go low, we go high” doesn’t work. Playing nice got us to this point with President Trump. This country may not survive another Republican Congress, so Democrats have to do what it takes.\n",
      "Democrats also need to infuse the party with new blood, especially women and people of color. No more Bernie, Hillary and Biden.\n",
      "Democrats need to be the party of the future. Republicans are the party of rich old white men.\n",
      "Then play dirty, Democrats. Yes, go after Mr. Trump. He is widely despised among everyone I know. Just take our country back.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Democrats should focus on the real problem — congressional Republicans. They are the ones hurting Americans, slyly enacting cruel legislation while the media focuses on the latest outrage by President Trump.\n",
      "So, don’t mention Mr. Trump’s name at all. Instead, show each voter how his very own representative or senator has hurt him personally. Show him the tax “cut” math — how many taxpayers’ taxes will increase, conveniently only after the midterms. Show him how the vote to repeal Obamacare’s individual mandate will increase his premiums.\n",
      "Democrats must constantly press concrete examples of Republican-caused harms, and hammer this message home relentlessly: Your Republican representative in Congress has not, does not and never will help you. He or she does not care about you.\n",

      "The varying Russia scandals are difficult to follow even for well-informed people spending a good deal of their time on the multiple threads. They are confusing and — for many voters the Democrats need — beside the point. Let Robert Mueller do his business and support him throughout. Otherwise restrain yourself. There may turn out to be not much there. There certainly aren’t many votes.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "As a progressive member of the party who has consistently felt dismissed and belittled by mainstream Democrats, I would strongly recommend that they treat the progressives as though we matter, and that our opinions and positions have value. To disregard or ridicule our interests and then to insist that we must vote Democratic is demoralizing. We have enough trouble motivating people to vote without treating them as though their only importance to the party is pulling the Democratic lever.\n",
      "It’s true that both sides of the party need to compromise and work together in order to win, but so far “compromise” seems to mean “progressive people, do as you’re told.”\n",

      "To the Editor:\n",
      "I have been a registered Democrat since being able to vote, and I come from a very progressive family. Nonetheless, the Democrats’ persistent pushing of identity politics has made it nearly untenable for me to vote for my party in 2018 — yes, even in the face of Trumpism. The Democrats need to ease off the “cis white male bashing” and foster a narrative not based on identity politics, lest they lose their centrist base to appease a vocal radical fringe. Continuing doing what the party is currently doing is not convincing any middle-class and poor Rust Belt voters that we are the party that is best for them. We can’t afford another “deplorables” gaffe in 2018.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "The Democrats need to focus on a positive, inclusive and simple issue. I would suggest “fairness,” which strongly resonates with most people, including with many Trump voters who constantly complain that the system is rigged. Many people on the right feel that they have been left behind while others (immigrants, minorities, “welfare queens,” etc.) are cutting the line and unfairly using the government to their advantage. This anger needs to be redirected toward the real source of unfairness: the rich who take advantage of the poor and the middle class. The Democrats should above all explain as clearly as possible the causal link between the Republican tax cuts (very generous to the rich) and the Republican budget (very cruel to the poor and middle class).\n",

It was the party that conceived Social Security, Medicare and the Civil Rights Act and was willing to fight for those programs, damn the consequences, because they were right and just. Flash forward to now.\n",
      "The Democratic Party needs to begin by replacing the likes of the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and the Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, with new, exciting, dramatic figures. It needs to persuade young Democrats to run for leadership roles and national office. It needs to fully re-establish itself as the party of the working class and the forgotten, willing to pursue its ideals, damn the consequences.\n",

      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Democrats need to own up to the reality that Donald Trump got elected despite his personal flaws, not because of them. Voters have known since early 2016 that he says mean, ridiculous, asinine things, yet they tolerated him because he spoke about real problems affecting real people. Expressing outrage at his daily transgressions does nothing but remove Democrats from the people they need to win back — Trump voters who supported Democrats in past elections.\n",
      "KYLE DAVIS, HONOLULU\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "If the Democrats do not welcome “pro-life” candidates and planks into their party, they are ceding millions of well-educated voters of conscience who see abortion as a primary issue. So many people ignored President Trump’s shortcomings because he said he was anti-abortion, even though most of his life he was pro-choice. The entire Democratic agenda is probably more pro-life than the Republican one because of its emphasis on health care, safety net programs and eradicating poverty. Yet abortion will be the deciding issue for many voters and a test of the inclusiveness needed for Democrats to win.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Looking toward the 2018 midterms, Democrats have two clear advantages: a uniquely corrosive president with dismal approval ratings, and the historic trend of midterms swinging toward the opposition party. Offsetting these advantages, however, is the leftward march the party has taken since the Obama years, in which identity politics (transgender bathrooms, protecting illegal immigrants, fighting “white privilege”) and welfare-state economics (Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren) have come to dominate the party’s message. The result has been a party adored by coastal progressive states, but disconnected from much of the rest of the country. (More than one-third of House Democrats come from just three states: California, New York and Massachusetts.)\n",
      "There is nothing wrong with leading on progressive values, but for Democrats to win nationally they must first win back the country’s moderate center. They can start by repositioning themselves not as the party of post-white America (in a country still over 72 percent white), but of all Americans. And they should certainly never refer to Republican tax plans that allow most Americans to keep more of their own money as “Armageddon” (as did the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi).\n",
      "It is not too late for Democrats to radically alter their appeal to the broader American electorate. If they do, all Americans will benefit from a true national debate over issues and ideas.\n",

      "To be successful in November, Democrats need to make clear whom we are fighting for: every person, in every community. The anguish of a mother who lost her son to gun violence in Chicago is not so different from the pain of the father who lost his daughter to opioids in West Virginia. Our dreams are inextricably linked as well. Wherever we come from, we believe that every kid deserves a quality education. We believe that a job is about both financial security and a sense of dignity. We support Dreamers and laid-off coal miners. We demand justice for women, and we demand that our veterans get the mental health treatment they need and deserve. Every person counts. Every community counts.\n",
      "Democrats must fight for them all. Winning that fight is about more than winning elections. It’s about providing opportunities where none seem to exist, and hope in places filled with despair. It’s about summoning the spirit that compelled our party to champion the New Deal, the Great Society and the credo of Yes, We Can. If we find that spirit again, there are no limits on what is possible for our party, and for the future of our country.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Democrats must stop playing the victim — even those who may actually be victims, for we all know how unfair life can be — and must drop the politically impractical emphasis on identity politics. Democrats must stress policy and politics rather than personalities and prejudice, from the president on down.\n",
      "Democrats must focus on what works for the bottom 90 percent, rather than demonizing the top 10 percent. Most people, wisely or not, believe they can become wealthier. Advocating what works for most people is far more effective than merely blasting the well off.\n",
      "Democrats need to stress the sheer volume of votes needed to overcome gerrymandering, voter suppression and other tools so effectively used by the G.O.P.\n",
      "Most of all, Democrats must appeal to the vast majority of voters who are either center-left or center-right.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "Dear Democrats:\n",
      "You want our votes? Show us clearly what you would do if you regained the majority in Congress. Prepare a detailed counterprogram for us, as Newt Gingrich did with his Contract With America in 1994.\n",
      "Have a plan for health care like Medicare for all. Specify what you will do to make sure we have clean air and water, worker safety, good transportation and better infrastructure. Craft a fair immigration agenda. Show us a real tax reform that helps the middle class, the motor of our economy. There are so many good ideas: a carbon tax, a financial transaction tax to fund necessary programs. Fight poverty. Address climate change. Help women reach real equality.\n",
      "No slogans — we want an evidence-based plan. Show that you are different, that you are not for the 1 percent only. Be the populist that President Trump failed to be.\n",
      "To the Editor:\n",
      "President Trump is bold and strong. Democrats, on the other hand, are careful and weak. The Affordable Care Act is a mess. Most people, except the insurance industry and its friends, want Medicare for all. We’re sick of milquetoast Democrats. Support single-payer health care, raising taxes on the rich, taxing Wall Street transactions and making public higher education free. Support labor unions, paid parental leave, the Equal Rights Amendment and renewable energy. Bring the United States into the 21st century!\n",
      "Don’t waste time going after Mr. Trump; everyone knows what he’s about already. Democrats need to be more than the lesser of two evils. Be something we can be proud of, something that will motivate us to get out and vote.\n",

      "The election of 1968 decided one thing: that Richard M. Nixon and not Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey would become president. It left nearly everything else unresolved. The course of the war in Vietnam, where more than half a million American servicemen were stationed and more than 30,000 had been killed; the fate of the poor in an affluent, but widely unequal, society; the ideological direction of both major political parties; the relationship between the generations and between black and white Americans — all these questions remained open and raw. An election that involved, by the cultural critic John Leonard’s accounting, an “immense expenditure … of money, bombast, blood and cretinism” ended, in effect, in a draw: a narrow victory by the candidate who had disclosed the least about his plans and beliefs, and a nation stuck somewhere along (or maybe off) the path from the old politics to the new. How that all happened is not an unfamiliar story, but it remains, nearly 50 years later, a gripping one.\n",
      "Lawrence O’Donnell, the host of a political talk show on MSNBC, tells that story with zeal in “Playing With Fire.” O’Donnell was a high school student in 1968, and well remembers the feeling among many young men of draft age that life was “a short-term game.” The presidential election, the young O’Donnell believed, “could end all that.” Viewers of O’Donnell’s show will recognize, in “Playing With Fire,” his faith in the redemptive power of public service — for all its disappointments and foolishness. As a former Senate staffer, O’Donnell takes a practitioner’s delight in the machinations of politics: He finds, and manages to convey, excitement in things like the movement of delegates from one camp to another. As a former producer and writer of the television drama “The West Wing,” he also knows how to pace a story, and could not have dreamed up a more compelling cast of characters. On the Democratic side, in addition to Humphrey, there were Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy, as well as President Lyndon B. Johnson, who left the race in March but then stalked the sidelines, hoping to be called back in. For the Republicans, a trio of governors — Ronald Reagan, Nelson A. Rockefeller and George Romney — threatened Nixon’s ascension. And George Wallace, the segregationist governor of Alabama, ran as an independent and a spoiler. Never in the past century have so many heavyweights contended, all at once, for the White House.\n",
      "This is the voice of the pundit, and in a work of history it sounds jarring — all the more so when it’s discussing Donald Trump, as O’Donnell does repeatedly. In the opening chapter, he quips that Trump “should leave a thank-you note at Nelson Rockefeller’s grave … for paving the way in Republican presidential politics for the rich men of Fifth Avenue with complicated marital histories.” O’Donnell goes on to say that “Reagan was the Donald Trump of the 1960s”; that Wallace voters in 1968 “sounded like Trump voters in 2016”; and that Johnson’s crudeness “would not be outdone until Donald Trump moved into the White House.” Some of these parallels are legitimate enough, but they interrupt the narrative and give it, at times, a partisan casting.\n",
      "O’Donnell’s program on MSNBC is called “The Last Word,” and each night he closes the show with one. His last word in “Playing With Fire” is surprising: “The peace movement won.” He attributes that victory mainly to McCarthy, because “no one did more to stop the killing in Vietnam.” O’Donnell acknowledges that there was a lot more killing ahead — six years’ worth, after Nixon’s election, at a cost of more than 20,000 American lives, and an even greater number of Vietnamese. But he is certain that “if Gene McCarthy had not run for president in 1968, the draft would not have ended in 1973” and the United States would not have withdrawn its troops by 1975. That is a strangely speculative conclusion. It could just as easily be argued that McCarthy, for all the nobility of his cause, actually prolonged the war by widening the divisions among Democrats and helping to elect Nixon — who, upon taking office, began to escalate what he called his “war for peace.” In 1968, America lost.\n",

      "It’s probably inappropriate to evaluate a work of history on the basis of how many novels can be extracted from its pages; it’s also, if one is a novelist, irresistible. Which real-life situations and characters are so intriguing that they’d be worthy of delving into and depicting in the truly intimate manner that only fiction allows? By this measure — and by several others — “The Woman’s Hour: The Great Fight to Win the Vote,” by the journalist Elaine Weiss, is a gold mine.\n",
      "After Congress passed the 19th Amendment in 1919, ratification needed to occur in 36 states for women’s right to vote to become federal law. By July 1920, the possible 36th state — or the place where the amendment would die after 70 years of strenuous activism — was Tennessee. Thus, for several weeks that summer, in and around Nashville’s statehouse, a frenetic pageant of political organizing, lobbying, demonstrating and double-crossing unfolded among the “Antis,” who opposed the amendment, and the “Suffs,” or suffragists, who supported it. As one legislator declared, “The entire world today has cast its eyes on Tennessee.”\n",
      "Weiss presents a panoramic view of the proceedings, which are alternately juicy (accusations of libel and bribery abounded, and, in spite of Prohibition, the whiskey and bourbon were free-flowing) and procedural. Weiss also provides national and international context: World War I had ended less than two years earlier, and both the war and its aftermath had jumbled established norms of gender, race and employment. In the United States, a physically ailing Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House, and two Ohioans, Warren Harding and James Cox, were vying to replace him, which raised the stakes of the 19th Amendment’s passage: Though women in some states could already vote, it was unclear how enfranchising all 27 million American women in time for the fall’s presidential election would influence national politics.\n",
      "In addition to offering contemporaneous perspective, Weiss goes back several decades to the roots of the women’s movement and the efforts of Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others. Weiss celebrates their persistence and courage but does not sugarcoat their racism. Despite early unity with abolitionists, upper-middle-class white women willing to sacrifice racial equality for gender equality is nothing new. During the ratification in Nashville, Carrie Catt, the New York-based president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the successor to Susan B. Anthony, made calculated decisions to distance her groups’ interests from those of black men and women. After all, much of the Anti reluctance to grant women the vote was tied up with not wanting black women to vote.\n",
      "Weiss details the tribalism within the women’s movement as personified by Catt and the more militant and provocative Alice Paul, who led the National Woman’s Party. Though Paul was short on money and didn’t travel to Nashville for the special session, she dispatched the native Tennessean Sue Shelton White, an activist who could, with her very accent, dispel accusations about meddling outsiders. Weiss depicts another native daughter of Tennessee, this one a committed Anti: Josephine Pearson, who presided over multiple Anti groups and believed that in fighting against ratification, she was obeying both God and her deceased mother.\n",
      "Weiss is a clear and genial guide with an ear for telling language (“I’d rather see my daughter in a coffin than at the polls,” declares one Anti, while a newspaper headline about a pretty, young Suff reads “110 Pounds of Femininity to Hit Legislators for Vote”). She also shows a superb sense of detail, and it’s the deliciousness of her details that suggests certain individuals warrant entire novels of their own.\n",
      "For example, Annie Nathan Meyer and Maud Nathan, New York sisters, were respectively an Anti and a Suff, who didn’t speak to each other except when “clashing publicly.” Luke Lea, the swaggering publisher of a Nashville newspaper, a onetime senator and a member of the Men’s Ratification Committee, had concocted a plan to kidnap Kaiser Wilhelm after the armistice. He abandoned the kidnapping attempt, returned to Nashville and married his dead wife’s sister. Or how about Louisine Havemeyer, a grandmother who lived in a Fifth Avenue mansion in New York and used her fortune, acquired via her sugar magnate husband, to support Suff radicals and who once found herself, by design, in jail? (While participating in an effigy-burning of President Wilson outside the White House, Havemeyer said she felt “as placid and calm as if I were going out to play croquet on a summer afternoon.”)\n",
      "I’m almost certain that the name Hillary Rodham Clinton appears only once, in the last few pages. Yet it is, of course, impossible to read “The Woman’s Hour” without thinking of the 2016 presidential election, of the symbolic and literal impact of Clinton’s candidacy, the consequences of her loss, the way she was and still is portrayed in the news media. Clinton’s decision to wear the Suffs’ color of white for the most important events of her campaign (and to Donald Trump’s inauguration) suggests that she perceives herself as part of an ongoing legacy.\n",
      "“The Woman’s Hour” offers several timely reminders: of how history-altering legislation comes about after much nitty-gritty, unglamorous fieldwork; of how tenuous the progress toward true equality under the law really is; of how social and legal changes that in retrospect seem inevitable were hardly considered such at the time (indeed, even after the 19th Amendment passed, its ratification was contested repeatedly). And yet, if nothing can be taken for granted and change rarely comes without a fight, there remains reason for optimism.\n",
      "“Everything the Cause had accomplished — every state won, every piece of legislation, every change of heart and shift in policy — was once considered utterly impossible,” Weiss writes. “Until it wasn’t.”\n",
      "Curtis Sittenfeld is writing a novel about Hillary Rodham’s life if she hadn’t married Bill Clinton. Her story collection, “You Think It, I’ll Say It,” will be published next week.\n",

      "Francis M. Bator, a White House economist who nudged the Johnson administration toward a closer collaboration with Western Europe while reconciling with the Soviet Union and its Communist satellites, died on Thursday in Dedham, Mass. He was 92.\n",
      "He had been struck by an automobile in January while crossing the street and never recovered, his son, Christopher, said.\n",
      "As an economist who embraced the Keynesian premise that an economy’s total spending influences the output, or gross domestic product, Professor Bator wrote influential books and papers. He popularized the phrase “market failure” to capsulize what occurs when market forces do not produce an optimal outcome.\n",
      "His 1957 article “The Simple Analytics of Welfare Maximization” became a standard tool for teaching microeconomics, or the economic impact of individual decision-making.\n",
      "In 1966, as deputy special assistant to the president for national security affairs under Mr. Rostow, Professor Bator drafted an early version of a speech in which Johnson signaled a shift from coexistence to “peaceful engagement” with the Soviet bloc.\n",
      "Besides easing trade constraints and cultural exchanges, Johnson held out the prospect of mutual military reductions if Cold War relations between East and West thawed.\n",
      "At the same time, while Johnson affirmed support for NATO, he sought unity among the Western allies by ignoring President Charles de Gaulle’s decision to withdraw French troops from NATO’s integrated command.\n",
      "When he left the White House, where his portfolio included monetary policy, tariffs and curbing nuclear proliferation, The Economist wrote: “On most of these matters most of the time, a thread of lucidity, consistency and balance has been traceable in the administration’s handling, and Mr. Bator has had a lot to do with it.”\n",
      "Francis Michel Bator was born on Aug. 10, 1925, in Budapest. He fled to the United States with his family in 1939 as the pro-fascist Hungarian government edged closer to Germany. In New York, his father, Victor, was a banker, writer, teacher and publisher of a newspaper for Hungarian expatriates. His mother was the former Franciska Sichermann.\n",
      "Francis Bator was being shipped to the Pacific as an Army infantry officer when Japan surrendered in 1945.\n",
      "He considered majoring in literature in college, but switched to economics and earned a bachelor of science degree in 1949 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he later received a doctorate in economics.\n",
      "He and his wife, the former Micheline Martin, separated in 1972. Besides her and their son, he is survived by a daughter, Nina Bator Moss; his partner, Jae Roosevelt; and four grandchildren.\n",
      "His 1960 book, “The Question of Government Spending,” was described by The New York Times as one of the seven that shaped President John F. Kennedy’s approach to the presidency. He was an adviser to the Agency for International Development before moving to the White House early in 1964 to work for Mr. Bundy, the national security adviser.\n",
      "While Professor Bator was opposed to widening the Vietnam War, he later sought to clarify if not defend Johnson’s rationale for doing so. “The war deprived the Great Society reforms of some executive energy and money,” he wrote in a 1997 paper.\n",
      "“But Johnson believed — and he knew how to count votes — that had he backed away in Vietnam in 1965, there would have been no Great Society to deprive,” Professor Bator added. “It would have been stillborn in Congress.”\n",
      "After he left the White House, in part because of the war, he issued a warning, telling The Boston Globe, “The real nightmare for all of us, not over the next few years but over the next 25, consists in a world split between a rich minority and an enormous majority of semi-industrialized poor — colored, angry and equipped with modern strategic arms.”\n",

      "HOUSTON — At the Episcopal church that has been her spiritual home for more than 50 years, the former first lady Barbara Pierce Bush was celebrated at her funeral as one of the most beloved political matriarchs in American history.\n",
      "As her coffin lay beneath an ivory-colored pall in the center aisle of St. Martin’s Episcopal Church, some of the most powerful and famous political figures in the United States — including four of the five living former presidents — gathered to honor a woman who carried her own power and fame lightly.\n",
      "“We learned to strive to be genuine and authentic by the best role model in the world,” Mrs. Bush’s son, Jeb Bush, the former two-term governor of Florida, told mourners in his eulogy. The family called her Bar, Mother, Ganny, the Silver Fox and, notably, the Enforcer, as she used her wit, humor and tough love to raise six children, 17 grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.\n",

      "Jon Meacham, a presidential historian, said in his eulogy that he once asked Mrs. Bush’s husband, the former president, if he knew early on how resilient his wife would be. He and Mrs. Bush had met shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, in December 1941, at a dance in Greenwich, Conn. She was 16. He was 17.\n",
      "“She’s the rock of the family, the leader of the family,” Mr. Bush told Mr. Meacham. “I kind of float above it all.”\n",
      "Nearly 8,000 people, from the rich and the famous to the working-class and the anonymous, came to St. Martin’s for a public viewing on Friday and the private funeral on Saturday.\n",
      "From noon to midnight on Friday, more than 6,200 people paid their respects at the viewing, filing past her closed coffin and pausing just long enough to bow their heads or make the sign of the cross. On Saturday, about 1,500 people attended the funeral, under the watch of hundreds of local, state and federal law enforcement officers.\n",
      "Former President Jimmy Carter and Eleanor Rosalynn Carter, the former first lady, were also not present; a spokeswoman said that Mr. Carter would be on a private trip overseas and that Mrs. Carter was recovering from recent surgery.\n",
      "Three former first ladies — Michelle Obama, Laura Bush and Hillary Clinton — joined the current one, Melania Trump, at St. Martin’s on Saturday. Even at the funeral for a woman who famously said she left the politics to her husband, the imagery was impossible to ignore in this moment of bitter divisions in American political life. In a single front pew, Mrs. Trump sat shoulder to shoulder with the Obamas and the Clintons to pay tribute to a Bush family eminence.\n",

      "“What an interesting thing to be a confidant to a woman who has no secrets,” Mrs. Bush’s pastor, the Rev. Russell J. Levenson Jr., the rector of St. Martin’s, said in his homily. “What you saw was what you got.”\n",
      "Mr. Levenson recalled the day he and Mrs. Bush were walking together on the beach in Kennebunkport, Me.\n",
      "“Barbara was washing off her own shoes, and a fellow came up to her and said, ‘Hey, you look a lot like Barbara Bush,’” Mr. Levenson told the audience. “Without missing a beat, Barbara just said, ‘Yes, I hear that a lot.’”\n",
      "In the church were not only Bushes and Clintons, but Kennedys, Nixons, Fords and Johnsons, including Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of former President John F. Kennedy; Tricia Nixon Cox, the daughter of former President Richard M. Nixon; Susan Ford Bales, the daughter of former President Gerald Ford; and Luci Baines Johnson and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, the daughters of former President Lyndon B. Johnson.\n",
      "They were joined by hundreds of other dignitaries, including Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas; two former vice presidents, Dick Cheney and Dan Quayle; the former British prime minister John Major; and the former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney.\n",
      "The coffin was wheeled out of the church by eight of Mrs. Bush’s grandsons, who served as pallbearers. She was buried more than 90 miles northwest in College Station, in a private service on the grounds of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum. She was laid to rest beside her daughter Robin, who died of leukemia at the age of 3 in 1953.\n",
      "Mrs. Bush’s wit did not wane as she approached the end of her life.\n",
      "Days before her death, Mr. Levenson, Mrs. Bush’s pastor, arrived at the Bush home in the Tanglewood section of Houston late Saturday afternoon. Mrs. Bush had gone upstairs to bed. Mr. Levenson walked up the stairs to pray with her.\n",

      "In her last days and even hours, Mrs. Bush appeared to be surrounded by her two favorite things as she lay on her bed — her family and her books. Friends, relatives and medical assistants read to Mrs. Bush, a longtime advocate of adult and child literacy. They read to her from the Bible and from her book about her late English springer spaniel, Millie. Mr. Levenson read from the Book of Psalms, and then a couple of chapters from “Little Women.”\n",
      "“‘Pride and Prejudice’ is actually her favorite book,” Mr. Levenson said. “I was looking for that as I was going through her library downstairs, and I thought that was a good runner-up.”\n",
      "On Saturday, after he prayed with Mrs. Bush, Mr. Levenson stepped outside the bedroom, shut the door and was talking to her medical aides when he heard Mrs. Bush call out. Mr. Levenson went back to the door.\n",
      "“I said, ‘Bar, are you O.K.?’ And she said, ‘Yes. But tell him I adore him.’”\n",
