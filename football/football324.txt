AdvertisementSupported byPHOENIX — Roger Goodell, the commissioner of the N.F.L., told the league’s 32 owners on Monday that he would soon appoint the departing director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives as the new chief disciplinary officer.The new special counsel would allow Goodell to no longer have to discipline players accused of drug offenses, domestic violence and other off-field issues.When the full scope of that job became apparent, Goodell decided to split the job into two positions. Jones is expected to be in charge of disciplining players, while Lisa Friel, who works for the N.F.L. as an adviser on domestic violence issues, will be in charge of investigating allegations of off-field misconduct. Jones and Friel will report to Goodell.The N.F.L. also created an owners committee, led by Michael Bidwill, a former federal prosecutor who owns the Arizona Cardinals, to oversee the league’s personal conduct policy.The owners, general managers and coaches began their annual three-day meeting in Phoenix on Monday.After Goodell suspended Rice, a former Baltimore Ravens running back, for two games after he punched his fiancée in an elevator a year ago, he was widely criticized for being arbitrary and opaque in the way he penalized players.Once they are formally appointed, Jones and Friel are likely to have to decide what to do with Hardy, who remains suspended with pay after he was convicted of domestic violence.His case, though, was overturned on appeal. The Cowboys this month signed Hardy, a defensive lineman, to a one-year contract even though it was unclear whether he would be suspended.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
