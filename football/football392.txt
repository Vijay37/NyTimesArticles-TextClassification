Keep ’em coming, everyone. You have until 7 a.m. Eastern on Aug. 26 to post your final entries of the season.Two sports achieve the title of most popular in America right now, basketball and football. While both are widely popular, the leadership from the organizations behind them, the National Basketball Association and National Football League, are headed in two vastly different directions.On the one hand, the NFL has been surrounded by controversy from Roger Goodell’s mishandling of numerous domestic violence cases. Conversely, since his promotion to commissioner of the NBA, Adam Silver has led with dignity, using his power for positive change. His first major move was the banishment of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA because of his extremely racist comments over the course of many years. Recently, Silver again made a bold statement when he removed the 2017 All-Star Game from North Carolina because of its recently passed anti-LGBT laws.I am proud to be a fan of basketball knowing that the NBA stands for equality and firmly against discrimination. Also, I am extremely interested to see what steps Silver takes in the future in regards to discrimination. With many athletes speaking out against police brutality, including many in the NBA, I hope Silver supports these statements because the NBA can be a catalyst for positive change under the right guidance. During this important time in our country, I’m glad to see at least one sports organization is using their power for good.Runners-UpHonorable MentionsAdvertisement
