# NyTimesArticles-TextClassification
This project is used to classify NyTimes articles into Business, Sports, Entertainment and Politics.

Using NyTimesArticles API, articles from four different categories are collected.
Later the collected articles are split into three sets of data: Train Data, Validaiton Data and Test Data.

Now the articles are trained using various Machine Learning classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive-Bayes Classifier, etc.

These different models are analyzed based on their accuracy across Validaiton data and Test Data.
