1,A cinematic history of going airborneAt 1035 on the morning of Dec 17 1903 on the sand dunes of Kitty Hawk NC  Do I need to finish the sentenceThe Korona had a fastenough shutter and a sensitiveenough plate to capture rapid movement in a frame Daniels a firsttime photographer was following whether he knew it or not in the footsteps of GaspardFlix Tournachon known to his public and to posterity as Nadar the French artist and entrepreneur who had the brilliant idea a halfcentury before the miracle at Kitty Hawk of going up in a hotair balloon with a camera Our vision of the world  quite literally our sense that the surface of this planet can be flown over and surveyed from above  owes as much to Nadar as our ability to circumnavigate it owes to Orville and Wilbur WrightNadar died in 1910 having anticipated and then lived to witness the birth of motion pictures which custom has fixed in 1895 The Wright Flyer arrived on the scene early in the new century in time to give the nascent art of movies invented in America by Thomas Edison one of its great subjects And for more than a century since the visions of cinema and the experience of flight have worked together in ways both obvious and mysterious Movie cameras and airplanes are the twin manifestations of ancient human desires that dwelled for most of our existence as a species in myth and fantasy Our ancestors made likenesses of everything under the sun in various media to bridge the strange chasm between thing and idea They conjured legends of birdgods and parables in which the urge to take wing was a symbol of aspiration and of hubrisAdvertisementWhat if we could counterfeit reality so completely that the representation would partake of the essence of the original closing the gap between the world and our imagination of it What if we could fly The two dreams link up almost effortlessly and the technologies of their realization complement each other The first movie to win a Best Picture Oscar was Wings The most recent was Birdman The camera has learned not only to record flight but also to replicate its rhythms and feelings  to swoop and soar to blast off and fall to earth to hover over rooftops and leap tall buildings in a single boundAdvertisementWhen a dream comes true though it touches down amid the dross of ordinary life Moving pictures and flying machines became less marvelous as they became ubiquitous We take them for granted and have even come to resent themThe camerawork is similarly primitive and ingenious No fast cuts no dollies or cranes to mimic and counterpoint the movement of the objects within the frame The little window in your laptop screen opens on a charmingly and almost absurdly simpler time a collection of antique moments that is also a foreshadowing of the presentAdvertisementDid you see Furious 7 Not technically a flight picture but an automotive movie that extends the highway into the clouds Do you remember when the cars parachuted out of the belly of the transport plane and hit the mountain running at full speed Or when the red sports coupe  was Vin Diesel driving Michelle Rodriguez  went zooming around inside the big glass tower in Abu Dhabi and then smashed through the window and sailed over to the other tower and kept going Oh man Pure adrenaline And pure slapstick sublimity How did they do that How did they even think of itThe fun however has always cast a shadow The Furious 7 skyscraper sequence thrilling though it is cant help evoking the Sept 11 attacks An instant clich after the planes hit the twin towers was It was like something out of a movie In the years since movies have fought to reclaim the imagination of disaster as their special purview and to restore the innocent anarchy of impact velocity and flight We want the thrill without the danger But the danger is there alongside the liberation These machines  airplanes and movie cameras  bring terror along with wonderIt was Hollywood that would develop a practical aesthetic link between film and aviation most famously in Wings the inaugural Oscar winner in 1929 and a blockbuster of the pretalkie era An elaborate and expensive production filmed on location around a San Antonio military base and directed by William Wellman a decorated former fighter pilot Wings was perhaps more admired for its technical innovation than for its rather conventional story In that regard it was an early example of what has become a sturdy Hollywood genre the effectsdriven blockbusterPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersFor decades aviation pictures like Wings Devil Dogs of the Air and for the less militaryminded John Fords Air Mail were Hollywood staples The genre fed off the publics interest in the reallife exploits of Charles Lindbergh Amelia Earhart and other celebrity pilots When the United States entered World War II the military commissioned Ford and other prominent directors  notably Frank Capra William Wyler George Stevens and John Huston  to bring carefully packaged images of the fighting into American movie theaters In Five Came Back his detailed chronicle of these five wartime auteurs the journalist Mark Harris notes that before long generic sops to patriotism and adroit use of newsreel footage were no longer enough to stir a jaded public or to make a war documentary worth showing in theaters Moviegoers didnt want the story behind the war  they wanted the war brought home in pictures they couldnt see anywhere elseTo this end Wyler and his crew embedded as we might now say with the 91st Bomb Group They took their 16millimeter cameras on bombing runs in Harriss words lying flat along the belly of the B17 so they could shoot footage through the ball turret the position on the planes underside that allowed a gunner to fire in all directions Wyler who won his first Oscar for Mrs Miniver while overseas would later be awarded an Air Medal for participating in five sorties and suffer severe damage to his hearing on a subsequent assignment in Italy The results of his time with the 91st Bomb Group were assembled into a short documentary called Memphis Belle 1944 which James Agee praised for its immediacyAdvertisementI could not guess which shots were reenacted and which were straight records Agee confessed and postwar movies would often aspire to induce precisely this confusion Agee had an ethical commitment to documentary and a temperamental suspicion of artifice and during the war his insistence on the literal visceral truth reflected the biases of the filmmakers themselves who often battled Army censors over how much unvarnished reality they could show But the line between truth and trickery is not always so clear When the fighting stopped filmmakers used some of the documentary techniques tested in combat to blur it in new ways in the service of sensation rather than homefront moraleNowadays weve turned Agees moral puzzlement into a formalist game The famous Ride of the Valkyries sequence in Francis Ford Coppolas Apocalypse Now  the helicopter assault led by Robert Duvalls sociopathic Lieutenant Colonel Kilgore on a Vietnamese hamlet  partakes of some of the immediacy of documentary Those are actual helicopters in literal space and the flames are real too And so was Coppolas war even if the film is a pure fantasia rather than a factual record The Xwing fighter attack on the Death Star in the movie we now call Star Wars Episode IV  A New Hope has its own sense of reality even if its all taking place in a longagoandfaraway zone of makebelieveWhich might mean that we have arrived in a version of the Futurists Utopia a world defined by violence and speed ubiquitous flying machines and nonstop moving pictures We can take to the air on the backs of mythical birds or with the assistance of bulky metal suits like Iron Man or extraterrestrial super powers like Superman We can fling imaginary bodies into virtual space with a few swipes and keystrokes Our machines are so refined they dont even seem like machines anymoreWe inhabit a time of firstperson video games and drone warfare in which the distance between the cockpit and the screen has all but collapsed and physical space seems more and more abstract We cant tell if were rocketing through the ether or sitting perfectly stillAir travel is nothing special Quite the opposite It is the realm in which the petty indignities and dubious conveniences of modern life are most heavily concentrated For the price of an economy ticket we can endure the rote dumbness of state authority Place your shoes directly on the belt and the false friendliness of corporate power So many choices to fill the dead time  Panda Express Starbucks Brookstone  none of them quite what we want Including the choices for inflight viewing on the headrest in front of usAll too often our practices of moviegoing and watching are similarly alienated We shuffle into identical charmless multiplexes in suburban malls or chainstoreclogged downtowns grumble at the rudeness of our neighbors who text or talk or kick the back of our seat eat snacks we dont really like and fidget through the trailers as we wait for the feature At home we have the illusion of more control more choice and better snacks but we end up frittering away hours browsing the various menus and queues before settling down to the same old thingTheres an old song that says well know weve seen it all when elephants fly Which we have in Dumbo the movie that wrote the last word on cinematic flight way back in 1941 the time of Pearl Harbor and the Blitz maybe the darkest year in the short history of actual human flight When I See an Elephant Fly is the theme song a jaunty revolt against the idea that anything is impossible and Dumbo is one of Disneys early featurelength parables of gumption and tenacityAdvertisementIts hard to imagine a more earthbound creature than an elephant with big floppy ears But as Disney and other cartoon artists discovered the charm of animation lies in its complete defiance of the laws of physics You do not need to rig a crane attach a camera to a glider or hunker down in the ball turret of a flying fortress With a steady hand and a trained eye  with a labor force of draftsmen and colorists and cel cutters  you can reverse gravity and make your audience feel the giddiness and grace of unassisted flightDumbo is a cartoon but it is also an aviation picture a fantasy that models the movement of organic creatures on the flight of machines rather than the reverse Dumbo is a flyboy but hes also a plane requiring the help of Timothy Q Mouse for navigation and Contact His first sortie is accompanied by crows flying in Vformation more like a fighter squadron than an avian flock They also embody Disneys unfortunate fondness for racist stereotypes The elephant takes off in a cloud of dust and the first thing he sees when it clears is his shadow moving across the land below an uncanny sight familiar to every jet traveler lucky enough to score a window seat on a clear day Dumbos climactic triumphant flight under the big top at the circus is a barnstorming tour de force of the kind that brought crowds to the fairgrounds in the 20s and 30s and the theme music is accompanied not by animal noises but by airplanelike buzzing and zooming A potentially terrifying spectacle turns into a circus actIts this whimsy this absurdity this absolute indifference to the dictates of biology gravity and cinematic coherence  even a child will notice that the proportions are seriously out of whack  that make Dumbo the greatest of all inflight movies It establishes an essential truth that can be perpetually redefined and rediscovered The whole idea of flight is crazy We are earthbound creatures gray and lumbering and cursed with long memories We harbor dreams of liberation of transcendence but who are we kidding We cant flyA O Scott is a chief film critic for The Times His book Better Living Through Criticism How to Think About Art Pleasure Beauty and Truth

2,A number of industries can expect big changes in employee health insurance in the next year or two while others will continue with business as usualPerspectives from expert contributorsTo qualify for subsidized exchange plans workers cannot be offered affordable insurance by their employers Paradoxically employers will create subsidy opportunities for their middle and lowincome employees whenever they fail to offer health insuranceI measured employees relative to three times the poverty line because that is the family income threshold beyond which the new exchange subsidies are less valuable than the income tax preference for employersponsored health insuranceIndustries like colleges utilities and banking almost always offer health insurance and about 80 percent of their employees will be getting a better deal on employer health insurance than they would from the exchange plans because their families are above three times the poverty line For these reasons I am confident that these industries will continue to offer health insurance to their employees in much the same way that they have in the pastA couple of industries like accommodation and food services ie restaurants leisure and hospitality administrative and waste services and construction already have a mix of employers in terms of their health insurance offerings so it would not be unusual from an industry perspective for those that currently have health plans to drop them during the next couple of yearsMoreover the diagram shows how 45 to 60 percent of their employees do not come from families above three times poverty and therefore will have a significant federal health insurance subsidy waiting for them as soon as their employers drop coverageEmployers that do not offer health insurance may be subject to penalties but the penalties are not levied based on parttime employees or levied on small employers and even the penalties levied will be less than the subsidy opportunities created by an employer of middle and lowincome people that fails to offer health insuranceEach day Economix offers perspectives from expert contributorsFollowAdvertisement,banking,"['a', 'number', 'of',

8,AdvertisementA halfcentury has passed since President Lyndon B Johnson stunned Americans by announcing in a televised address on March 31 1968 that he was drastically reducing the bombing of North Vietnam appealing to the Hanoi government for negotiations and most incredible of all withdrawing from the presidential election that fall One imagines the stupefied reaction in living rooms all across the country Did he just say what I think he saidJohnson did what modern American presidents are never supposed to do refrain from seeking reelection Since World War II only Harry Truman in 1952 has done likewise He feared that his health could not withstand four more years but what really worried him was the Vietnam War and the divisions it had created The war was not just a threat to his personal legacy it was a threat to the very foundations of the liberal political order that he cherished so deeply and that had built so many middleclass American dreamsHis viewers didnt know it but Johnson had always suspected this moment would come From his earliest days in office he repeatedly told his wife Lady Bird and aides that he felt trapped on Vietnam that he would be crucified for whatever he did that the conflict in faroff Southeast Asia would ultimately be his downfallAlready in May 1964 a year before he committed the country to largescale war Johnson said to his national security adviser McGeorge Bundy I dont think its worth fighting for and I dont think we can get out Its just the biggest damned mess A year later shortly before the first American ground forces set foot in Vietnam Johnson told Senator Richard Russell of Georgia the chairman of the Armed Services Committee There aint no daylight in Vietnam Theres not a bitAdvertisementPublicly Johnson projected optimism But the truth is that he was always a bleak skeptic on Vietnam  skeptical that it could be won even with American air power and ground troops especially in view of the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese military and government and skeptical that the outcome truly mattered to American and Western securityAdvertisementThis attitude was reinforced by the opinions of people he valued The Senate Democratic leadership on foreign policy  J William Fulbright Russell and Mike Mansfield the majority leader  privately warned him in 1964 and 65 against Americanizing the war Allied leaders abroad did the same as did prominent voices in the pressHis own vice president Hubert H Humphrey a savvy politician who needed no reminder of the risks of losing a nation to Communism insisted in a memo in midFebruary 1965 that the risks of escalation were far greaterIf we find ourselves leading from frustration to escalation and end up short of a war with China but embroiled deeper in fighting in Vietnam over the next few months Humphrey warned political opposition will steadily mount because Americans had not been persuaded that a major war on behalf of an ineffectual Saigon government was

Vietnam Five years 500000 troops was the general estimate Johnson heard Where would that put the president in early 1968 as his campaign for reelection began in earnest Right where he found himself as he sat down to deliver his announcement on March 31 in a protracted war with no end in sightSo why did he go in Part of the answer surely is that escalation if done quietly gradually and without putting the nation on full war footing offered Johnson the path of least immediate resistance always a tempting option for a policymaker especially in domestic political terms Given his repeated public affirmations of Vietnams importance to American security it made sense that he would remain steadfast in the hope that the new military measures would succeed lest he face accusations of backing down of going softMore than that Johnson made the leap because for him retreat from the struggle was inconceivable He personalized the war saw attacks on the policy as attacks on himself and failed to see that his landslide victory in 1964 and the international and domestic context in early 1965 gave him considerable freedom of action  a point Humphrey cogently underscored in his February memoFrom Day 1 to the end Johnson was a hawk on Vietnam which proves again that doubting warriors can be committed warriors He always framed his options in such a way that standing firm appeared the only reasonable choice  it was full retreat bomb the hell out of China or stay the course Never did he fully explore imaginative ways out of the conflict for him extrication without victory signified humiliation and defeatAdvertisementThis didnt mean Johnson rejected all talk of negotiations After mid1965 he pressed Under Secretary of State George Ball for new diplomatic ideas  although as Ball later remarked he really meant merely new channels and proceduresWhen negotiations with North Vietnam at last began in Paris in May 1968 Johnson took a firm line He also continued the bombing and indeed increased it below the 19th Parallel and in Laos In the 10 months from March 1 to Dec 31 1968 the Pentagon dropped a greater tonnage of bombs on Indochina than had been expended in the three years prior This expanded bombing Daniel Ellsberg hauntingly concludes in his memoir of the war was obediently carried out by men from Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford on down to flight crews who believed it served no national purpose whateverHumphrey won the Democratic nomination in 1968 yet Johnson was reluctant to throw his full support behind him privately accusing the vice president of being cowardly and disloyal whenever he expressed a desire to move policy even modestly in a dovish direction Some part of Johnson preferred to see Richard Nixon as his successor expecting with reason that the Republican would be more resolute than Humphrey in pursuing the warAnd so it ended the saga of Lyndon Johnsons presidency its denouement having been anticipated by him at the beginning He was a man who dreamed big dreams for the Great Society who hoped that his prodigious efforts on civil rights voting rights education and Medicare would earn him a place alongside Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt  and who anticipated from the start that Vietnam would ruin it allIt bears all the markings of tragedy but of a certain kind more Shakespearean than Greek more Macbeth than Agamemnon Whereas for the Greek playwrights the universe tends to be deterministic the hero at the mercy of forces beyond his control for Shakespeare the tragedy lies in the very choices the protagonist makes His Macbeth is no mere victim he contributes to his own demise The same must be said of Lyndon JohnsonFor those seeking symbols there is finally this On Jan 22 1973 Johnson died at his Texas ranch two days after hearing Nixon in his second inaugural address hint at cuts to the Great Society and remind Americans how far they had come from that bleak time in 1968 when they faced the prospect of seemingly endless war abroad and of destructive conflict at home The next day Nixon announced a deal had been reached in Paris to end the war and bring peace with honorFredrik Logevall

10,AdvertisementAttorney General Jeff Sessions testifying before the House Judiciary Committee where he was questioned about campaign contacts with Russians during the 2016 election Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying before the House Judiciary Committee showed selective recall on the Trump campaigns Russia contacts Mr Sessions said he had no reason to doubt these women who have accused the man who wants his old Senate seat Roy S Moore of seeking sexual or romantic favors from them as teenagersMr Sessions denied that he lied in October when he testified that he knew of nobody in the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign And I dont believe it happened he saidAdvertisementCourt records later revealed that Mr Sessions led a March 2016 meeting in which George Papadopoulos a campaign aide discussed his Russian ties and suggested setting up a meeting between Mr Trump and Vladimir V Putin the Russian presidentI had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports Mr Sessions saidMr Sessions testified Tuesday that was still hazy on the details about what Mr Papadopoulos had proposedAdvertisementBut on one matter he said his memory is clear he said he shot down Mr Papadopoulos idea of a TrumpPutin meeting And he said he told Mr Papadopoulos that he was not authorized to represent the campaign in such discussionsTo sum up Mr Sessions said he could not remember much about Russian influence on the Trump campaign except when he could block such influenceAs Democrats repeatedly put heat on Mr Sessions over the evolution of his testimony before Congress Representative Hakeem Jeffries Democrat of New York invoked an unexpected ostensible ally Senator Jeff SessionsHolding up a speech he said Mr Sessions had given on the Senate floor during the proceedings to remove President Bill Clinton from office Mr Jeffries said Mr Sessions had then justified his vote for removal by saying that he would not hold the president to a different standard than a young police officer he had prosecuted years before for lying under oathYou stated that you refused to hold a president accountable to a different standard than the young police officer who you prosecuted Mr Jeffries said Let me be clear The attorney general of the United States of America should not be held to a different standard than the young police officer whose life you ruined by prosecuting him for perjuryMr Sessions vehemently disagreed with the comparison repeatedly calling Mr Jeffries suggestion unfairAdvertisementMr Jeffries nobody nobody not you or anyone else should be prosecuted not be accused of perjury for answering the question the way I did in this hearing Mr Sessions said I have always tried to answer the questions fairly and accuratelySeveral Republican lawmakers urged Mr Sessions to crack down on leaks Republicans have generally responded to various TrumpRussia revelations  like the Washington Post report disclosing that a wiretap of the Russian ambassador had picked up his conversations about sanctions with Michael Flynn then Mr Trumps national security adviser  by saying the real scandal was the leaksMr Sessions told Rep Bob Goodlatte the Virginia Republican who chairs the committee that the leaking of classified information was a very grave offense He also said touted a significant increase in the number of open leak investigationsWe had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years we have 27 investigations open today Mr Sessions said We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks I think it has reached epidemic proportions It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continueLater Rep Jamie Raskin Democrat of Maryland brought up Mr Trumps accusation that the press is the enemy of the people said the Founders thought the free press was societys best friend and asked Mr Sessions to commit to not prosecuting investigative journalists for maintaining the confidentiality of their professional sourcesThat question garbled or conflated two different issues One is whether journalists could be jailed for contempt if they refuse to provide witness testimony when subpoenaed in connection with an investigation into or prosecution of their suspected sources The other is whether journalists could be prosecuted as alleged coconspirators in a criminal leakAdvertisementIll commit to respecting the role of the press and conducting my office in a way that respects that Mr Sessions responded We have not had a conflict in my term in office yet with the press but there are some things the press seems to think they have an absolute right to but it does not he addedHe offered no further details about where he draws the lineWhile the Trump campaign contacts with Russia is the main recurring theme a separate subplot has emerged surveillanceThe Liberty Act would require government agents to obtain a warrant from a judge to scrutinize such messages when the information pertains to Americans connected to a criminal investigation though not when it comes to a nationalsecurity investigation The Trump administration opposes that ideaAmong others Rep Ted Poe Republican of Texas pressed Mr Sessions about that issue Invoking the language of Fourth Amendment privacy rights he noted that the information in the internet repository was seized without a warrant and said querying the database amounts to a search He demanded you dont think probable cause and a warrant is required to go into that informationMr Sessions replied that the federal courts have so held adding I agree with the courts not you congressman on thatAdvertisementMr Poe responded It is the responsibility of Congress to set the privacy standard for AmericansThe Constitution supports the view that the government should get a warrant before it searches through internet databases without a warrant he said Otherwise that is spying on AmericansPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersMr Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee I have no reason to doubt these women who have accused Roy S Moore of seeking sex or romance with them when they were teenagersMr Moore is seeking to fill the Alabama Senate seat that Mr Sessions gave up when he was confirmed as attorney general And Mr Sessions remains a popular figure in Alabama The attorney generals views matter in his home stateWhats more Republican leaders in Washington are discussing whether Mr Sessions should launch a writein campaign to reclaim his seat If that does not happen and Mr Moore prevails in the Dec 12 special election there is talk of expelling the jurist from the Senate and prevailing on Alabamas governor Kay Ivey to appoint Mr Sessions back to the SenateMr Sessions appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was really a twofer There was the hearing on the Trump campaigns contacts with Russia guided by the committees Democrats who singlemindedly bored in on the topicThen there was the hearingonanytopicotherthanRussia orchestrated by the committees Republicans which scurried over federal eavesdropping law rising crime immigration and Hillary ClintonRepresentative Darrell Issa Republican of California summed up the Republican sentimentI dont speak Russian and I havent met with Russians and I dont really want to talk about that today he said before diving into questions about sober living homesThe Democrats were not exclusively concerned with Russia During his time with the attorney general Representative Steve Cohen Democrat of Tennessee paused the grilling to ask Mr Sessions about a subject long associated with him pot Comedy ensuedAdvertisementYou said one time that good people dont smoke marijuana Mr Cohen said Which of these people would you say are not good peopleMr Sessions began to explain in earnest but Mr Cohen cut him offQuickly John Kasich a good person George Pataki Rick Santorum Newt Gingrich Jeb Bush Arnold Schwarzenegger Judge Clarence Thomas  which are not good people he demanded citing prominent Republicans who ostensibly have admitted smoking dopeMr Sessions laughing with much of the hearing room chalked it up to context So the question was what do you do about drug use the epidemic were seeing in the country and how you reverse it Part of that is a cultural thing I explained how when I became the United States attorney in 1981 and the drugs were being used widely over a period of years it became unfashionable unpopular and people were seeing  it was seen as such that good people didnt use marijuanaAnd with that Mr Cohens allotted time for questioning endedRepresentative Robert Goodlatte the committees Republican chairman appeared to pile on when he said While I understand your decision to recuse yourself was an effort by you to do the right thing I believe you as a person of integrity would have been impartial and fair in following the facts wherever they ledAny hiccups in Mr Sessionss testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worseAnd Representative John Conyers the top Democrat on the panel did not make things easier for the attorney general when he asked Mr Sessions if the president should make public comments that might influence a pending criminal investigationMr Sessions hesitated He should take great care in those issues he said before adding a defense of Mr TrumpAdvertisementI would say its improper Mr Sessions said A president cannot improperly influence an investigation And I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influencedThere are significant concerns that the partisanship of the FBI and the department has weakened the ability of each to act objectively he saidDemocrats were incensed by the letter which they said they did not receive Mr Conyers said the appointment of a new special counsel was merely to cater to the Presidents political needs He argued that there was not sufficient evidence to do so And he said it smacked of a banana republicMr Sessions said that any decisions about the investigations would be made without regard to politics ideology or biasRepresentative Jim Jordan Republican of Ohio pressed Mr Sessions on a litany of issues that looks like they need a special counsel to investigate the attorney general was brusque  Looks like is not enough to appoint a special counselMr Sessions has twice told lawmakers under oath that as a foreign policy adviser to Mr Trumps campaign he did not communicate with Russians to aid Mr Trumps candidacy nor did he know of other members of the campaign who hadAdvertisementNow Mr Sessions must contend with comments he made last month in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee I did not and Im not aware of anyone else that did Mr Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with RussiansUnder oath knowing in advance that he would be asked about this subject the Attorney General gave answers that were at best incomplete said Mr Conyers I hope the Attorney General can provide some clarification on this problem in his remarks todayMatt Apuzzo contributed reportingSee

11,AdvertisementBoth men specialized in unconventional genre movies with largerthanlife antiheroes Their vigorous melodramas and baroque action films were often selfconsciously American Like other members of the greatest generation they were influenced by Ernest Hemingways emphasis on rites of midcentury existential manliness  although Aldrichs Emperor of the North 1973 out on Bluray from Twilight Time was inspired by the writing of and about Jack London Hemingways precursor in literary swaggerThe Road Londons memoir of riding the rails was a tale of the 1890s Christopher Knopfs screenplay updates the action to 1933 The movies tone is postBonnie and Clyde Hollywood new wave a scenic outlaw ballad mixing instances of extreme violence with ragtime high jinks Lyrical passages with the sunlight streaming through the boxcar slats slam up against brawny Sovietstyle montages of steel and steam There are flickers of softfocus period nostalgia but the movies antiauthoritarianism is as resolute as the snub nose on Marvins fistlike faceAdvertisementEmperor of the North opened a year after Martin Scorseses underappreciated Boxcar Bertha starred Barbara Hershey as a railriding union organizer But Aldrichs movie  a briefly glimpsed and appropriately hardboiled young woman aside  plays out in an almost exclusively male world Romantic interest such as it is is provided by a goodlooking aggressively callow aspiring hobo Keith Carradine named Cigaret after Londons ontheroad nom de guerre who functions as ANo 1s unwilling sidekick and pesky nemesisAdvertisementANo 1 is a canny operator and so is Aldrich who manages to spin a yarn at once discursive and streamlined The action filmed in and around Cottage Grove Ore on the same stretch of tracks as Buster Keatons The General never leaves the sylvan Northwest The ultimate battle waged with chains planks and axes between two primeval forces atop a speeding train caps what finally comes to seem an abstract contest in time and space  a heman illustration of the Johnny Mercer song Somethings Gotta GiveSet in the Florida Everglades in the early 1900s the movie out on DVD from Warner Archive pivots on the mortal combat between two equally determined men That this struggle pits Burl Ivess brutal swamp rat a poacher known as Cottonmouth for the pet water moccasin in his pocket against Christopher Plummers dedicated game warden mockingly called Bird Boy provides a backbeat of absurdityThe movies toughguy writer brother to the producer Stuart Schulberg and its badboy director were fiercely at odds Fired before Wind wrapped Ray rarely spoke of the film Schulberg published his script but regarded the movie as a cobbledtogether disaster Yet in faraway France the young critics of Cahiers du Cinma saw Wind as additional proof of the directors geniusThe war between Cottonmouth and Bird Boy and perhaps Schulberg and Ray makes for a compelling occasionally brilliant mess No ones idea of an auteurist the New York Times critic Bosley Crowther wrote that while Wind happens to be one of the most disordered professional motion pictures weve ever seen it also happens to be unusual robust and picturesque Not to mention deeply and perhaps unintentionally idiosyncraticPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersThe surrealism is heightened both by inserted wildlife footage worthy of the National Geographic Channel and the lacunae left by truncated subplots Bird Boy gets moral support and a Star of David pendant from a family of Jewish immigrants whose back story is never fully explained Similarly the absence of scenes identifying Cottonmouths teenage protg as his son suggests that the boy may be his paramour adding a possible subtext to the swamp rat brotherhood Aside from a brief scene in a bordello run by the retired stripper Gypsy Rose Lee there is little preparation for the drunken faceoff between Bird Boy and Cottonmouth which ends with the allAmerican declaration Heres to livin freeCreepy reptiles share screen space with colorful supporting players Schulberg may have been responsible for packing Cottonmouths gang with the circus clown Emmett Kelly the jockey Sammy Renick and the heavyweight boxer Tony Galento as well as casting the Pulitzer Prizewinning writer MacKinlay Kantor as a local judge although Ray who once programmed folk singers including Ives for the Voice of America was more likely responsible for recruiting the Florida RB artist Rufus Beacham uncredited as a fancyhouse piano playerNeither Emperor of the North nor Wind Across the Everglades is Citizen Kane or even Welless last studio film Touch of Evil But

12,AdvertisementBy November with Apple stock in the midst of a precipitous decline they were still bullish Fifty of 57 analysts rated it a buy or strong buy only two rated it a sell Apple shares continued their plunge and this week were trading at just over 450 down 36 percent from their peakHow could professional analysts have gotten it so wrongIt wasnt supposed to be this way A decade ago Congressional hearings and an investigation by Eliot Spitzer then the New York attorney general exposed a maze of conflicts of interest afflicting Wall Street research There were some notorious examples of analysts who curried favor with investment banking clients and potential clients by producing favorable research and then were paid huge bonuses out of investment banking fees Many investors and regulators blamed analysts overly bullish forecasts for helping to inflate the dotcom bubble that burst in 2000After a global settlement of Mr Spitzers investigation by major investment banks and the SarbanesOxley reform legislation in 2002 investment banking and research operations were segregated Conflicts had to be disclosed and research and analyst pay was detached from investment banking revenues among other measuresAdvertisementThese reforms seem to have worked  but only up to a point Other conflicts have come to the fore especially at large brokerage firms and investment banks And studies have shown that analysts are prone to other influences  like following the herd  that can undermine their judgments The reforms didnt necessarily make analysts better at their jobs said Stuart C Gilson a professor of finance at Harvard Business SchoolAdvertisementIt may be no coincidence that the only analyst who even came close to calling the peak in Apples stock runs his own firm and is compensated based on the accuracy of his calls Carlo R Besenius founder and chief executive of Creative Global Investments downgraded Apple to sell last Oct 3 with shares trading at 685 In December he lowered his price target to 420 and this week he told me he may drop it even further to 320Mr Besenius founded his firm a decade ago after spending many years in research at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers I saw so many conflicts of interest in trading investment banking and research so I started a conflictfree company he said this week from Luxembourg where he was born and now lives Wall Street is full of conflicts It still is and always will be Its incompetent at picking stocksSince the passage of SarbanesOxley several studies have documented a decline in the percentage of analysts buy recommendations albeit a modest one while sell recommendations have increased Before 2002 analyst recommendations were tilted toward optimistic at an extreme rate Ohad Kadan a professor of finance at Washington University in St Louis and coauthor of one of the studies told me this week Thats still true today but its not as extreme Its a little more balancedWhile investment banking conflicts have been addressed the most obvious conflict now is that research is funded through the trading desks Professor Gilson said If youre an analyst and one way your report brings in revenue is through increased trading a buy recommendation will do this more than a sell For a sell you have to already own the stock to generate a trade But anybody can potentially buy a stock Thats one hypothesis about why you still see a disproportionate number of buy recommendations That may be especially true for heavily traded stocks like Apple which generate huge commissions for Wall StreetBut no one thinks conflicts alone can explain the analysts abysmal recent Apple performance Theres too much unanimity Bruce Greenwald a professor of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School and a renowned value investor told me this week Thats whats so troubling When that many analysts are in agreement they cant all be conflictedHe and other experts say there are additional documented factors that help explain why Wall Street analysts are so often wrong they extrapolate from recent performance data they chase momentum they want to please their customers and they show a tendency toward herd behavior Which is to say they fall into the same pitfalls that afflict most investorsWhy arent they more sophisticated Youd hope they would be Professor Kadan said But they always fall into the same trapsPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersProfessor Greenwald agreed When something goes up they all put out buy recommendations Their models extrapolate past performance into the future They chase momentum With Apple they were right at 600 and they were right at 650 which reinforced the trend So why would they be wrong at 700AdvertisementProfessor Kadan said that momentum investing has its adherents and is often right at least in the short term that many investors focus on Youd hope that analysts of all people would be able to anticipate an abrupt reversal but theyre not very good at it They loved Apple at 700 Im sure they were trying to do their best but theyre prisoners of momentumAnother factor is that analysts have a tendency to tell their audience what it wants to hear The analysts are in the end sales people Professor Greenwald said Their credibility depends on their not upsetting their investors too much Everybody loved Apple everybody did well The bears were always wrong It took an enormous amount of courage to fight the tideProfessor Kadan agreed Analysts tend to herd Theres no big penalty if youre wrong because everyone else is wrong Youve got cover Youre not going to lose your job If you take a different opinion either you get a big prize if youre right or you lose your job An analyst needs to be really courageous to say something different from most other analystsMr Besenius the one analyst who downgraded Apple near its peak said Im not afraid to make big controversial calls but attributed his decision less to courage than to survival Im paid based on performance he said I have to go to my clients and explain why they should pay for my research when they can get it for nothing from the firms where they pay their trading commissionsMr Besenius based his recommendation on technical factors  as Apple hit 700 its upward momentum and trading volume were slowing  as well as more fundamental concerns about product quality and innovation as well as growing competition from rivals like Samsung And there were more subjective factors Mr Besenius said he became uncomfortable with what he deemed Apples arrogance I loved Steve Jobs he said He built a great company But he was one of the most arrogant CEOs Ive ever met The way he introduced new products was one big display of arrogance He ridiculed Microsoft as Micro who Thats a good reason to be cautious A little humility is a good thing An Apple spokesman declined to comment on Mr Beseniuss observationsIt galls Mr Besenius that market regulators dont measure the performance of Wall Streets research recommendations and he said he believed that they should require firms to disclose the track records of stocks their analysts recommend Theyre not being held accountable for bad recommendations he maintained Little firms like ours have to be better than the big firms We have to prove we can add value Otherwise we wouldnt have an existenceApple is only one prominent example of egg on analysts faces and bullish Wall Street analysts were right for years  until they were wrong Even today analysts remain overwhelmingly positive about Apple This week 44 analysts rated it a strong buy or buy although 10 now rate it a hold according to Thomson ReutersShould anyone listenMany brokers still rely on their analysts research and offer the analysts reports to clients for guidance in picking stocks to buy and sell But the Securities and Exchange Commission takes a skeptical approach Despite the reforms it helped put in place it warns on its Web site of continuing conflicts of interest and says flatly As a general matter investors should not rely solely on an analysts recommendation when deciding whether to buy hold or sell a stock It notes that many brokers arent allowed to contradict recommendations from

13,AdvertisementFor years now people have been talking about the insulated world of the top 1 percent of Americans but the top 20 percent of the income distribution is also steadily separating itself  by geography and by education as well as by incomeThis selfsegregation of a privileged fifth of the population is changing the American social order and the American political system creating a selfperpetuating class at the top which is ever more difficult to break intoProportionof familiesliving inupperincomeareas19702012Most affluent17High income30HighmiddleMiddleincomeareas6541LowmiddleLowestincomeareas30Low incomePoor19In hard numbers the percentage of families with children living in very affluent neighborhoods more than doubled between 1970 and 2012 from 66 percent to 157 percentAdvertisementAt the same time the percentage of families with children living in traditional middle class neighborhoods with median incomes between 80 and 125 percent of the surrounding metropolitan area fell from 647 percent in 1970 to 405 percentAdvertisementSegregation of affluence not only concentrates income and wealth in a small number of communities but also concentrates social capital and political power As a result any selfinterested investment the rich make in their own communities has little chance of spilling over to benefit middle and lowincome families In addition it is increasingly unlikely that highincome families interact with middle and lowincome families eroding some of the social empathy that might lead to support for broader public investment in social programs to help the poor and middle classGeographic segregation dovetails with the growing economic spread between the top 20 percent and the bottom 80 percent The top quintile is in effect disengaging from everyone with lower incomeswe have seen a threefold increase between 1972 and 2007 in topdecile spending on children an increase that suggests that parents at the top may be investing in ever more highquality day care and babysitting private schooling books and tutoring and college tuition and feesThe bottom line Smeeding wrote in an email is thisThe welltodo are isolated from the day to day struggles of the middle class and below to provide these key services health education job search and other opportunities to aid the upward mobility of their children But the upper middle class are happy to take advantage of tax subsidies for their own housing preschool for their kids and saving for college which benefit themPolitical leverage is another factor separating the top 20 percent from the rest of America The top quintile is equipped to exercise much more influence over politics and policy than its share of the electorate would suggest Although by definition this group represents 20 percent of all Americans it represents about 30 percent of the electorate in part because of high turnout levels The accompanying chart which shows voting patterns by income in the 2012 and 2014 elections illustrates this phenomenon it was created by Sean McElwee a policy analyst at Demos a liberal think tankThe top fifth have been prospering while the majority lags behind But the separation is not just economic Gaps are growing on a whole range of dimensions including family structure education lifestyle and geography Indeed these dimensions of advantage appear to be clustering more tightly together each thereby amplifying the effect of the otherThe same pattern emerges in the case of education Reeves cites data showing that 56 percent of heads of households in the top quintile have college or advanced degrees compared with 34 percent in the third and fourth quintiles and 17 percent in the bottom two quintilesSimilar patterns emerge in the percent of married householdsFamily structure as a marker and predictor of family stability makes a difference to the life chances of the next generation Reeves writesTo the extent that upper middle class Americans are able to form planned stable committed families their children will benefit  and be more likely to retain their childhood class status when they become adultsUsing 2013 census data Reeves finds that 83 percent of affluent heads of household between the ages of 35 and 40 are married compared with 65 percent in the third and fourth income quintiles and 33 percent in the bottom twoPercent of voters turning out in two elections by family income2012 electionPercent who voted46Less than

opportunities for those in the middle and on the bottom can all run into the solid wall of rational selfinterested upper middle class resistance Reeves arguesAdvertisementIn the 1980s voters in the top ranks of the income ladder lined up in favor of Republican presidential candidates by 21 In 1988 for example George HW Bush crushed Michael Dukakis among voters making 100000 or more by an impressive 34 points 6733Move forward to 2008 and 2012 In 2008 voters from families making 100000 to 200000 split their votes 5148 in favor of John McCain while those making in excess of 200000 cast a slight 5246 majority for Barack ObamaIn other words Democrats are now competitive among the top 20 percent This has changed the economic makeup of the Democratic Party and is certain to intensify tensions between the traditional downscale wing and the emergent upscale wingThe Republican Party in 2016 is an example of what can happen when the dominant wing fails to address the concerns of the majority The rebellion against the Republican establishment is on the verge of producing the nomination of a man who is anathema to the majority of elected officials and party activists a candidate with the potential to drag the party into minority status for years to comeAdvertisementThe Exeter survey found decisive majority support in the student body for Obama over Mitt Romney but the more interesting finding was that among Exeter students old enough to vote nine out of 10 identified themselves as liberal on social issuesIn the case of economic policy however these students were split

vulnerability of a liberal alliance in which the economic interests of those on the top  often empowered to make policy  diverge ever more sharply from those in the middle and on the bottomIt turns out that the United States has a doubleedged problem  the parallel isolation of the top and bottom fifths of its population For the top the separation from the middle and lower classes means less understanding and sympathy for the majority of the electorate combined with the comfort of living in a cocoonFor those at the bottom especially the families who are concentrated in extremely high poverty neighborhoods isolation means bad schools high crime high unemployment and high government dependencyThe trends at the top and the bottom are undermining cohesive politics but more important they are undermining social interconnection as they fracture the United States more and more into a class and race hierarchySee More Go to Home Page,election,"['advertisementfor', 'years', 'now',

the 2016 election the Judiciary Committee has more quietly been pursuing its own inquiryAttempts  pluralAdvertisementAdvertisementFor its part the House Judiciary Committee has so far steered clear of the Russia investigationThe committee will continue to focus on its investigation into Russian interference including potential collusion between Mr Trumps associates and the RussiansNext week the committee will hold a public hearing with intelligence experts and election officials about Russian interference in the 2016 election as well as how to thwart future meddlingPlease verify youre not a

activity took place behind closed doors In addition to hearing from Attorney General Jeff Sessions the committees members and staff privately questioned Adm Michael S Rogers the head of the National Security Agency Dan Coats the director of national intelligence and Jeh Johnson the former secretary of Homeland SecurityAdmiral Rogers and Mr Coats testified as a followup to their recent public appearance when committee members pressed them on whether Mr Trump had asked them to pressure Mr Comey to drop the investigation into Michael T Flynn the presidents former national security adviserWill they or wont theyRepresentative Adam B Schiff of California the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee said in an interview on Thursday that he was pushing for the panel to include obstruction of justice in its investigation It is unclear whether Representative K Michael Conaway of Texas the Republican leading the inquiry agreesThe House panel will hold a public hearing with Mr Johnson on Wednesday signaling that it is staying focused specifically on the question of Russian interference Mr Johnson was homeland security secretary last year when hackers carried out attacks on the Democratic National Committee and some state election databasesIn the months since Mr Comey declared before the House committee that the FBI was examining whether Mr Trumps associates worked with Russians to interfere in the election the Senate Intelligence Committee has largely attracted the spotlight with its closely watched public hearings as the House panel has kept a lower

19,AdvertisementHeres a look at whats nextMr Trump must search for a new FBI director An announcement will not be made on Wednesday but is likely by the end of the week because Mr Trump intends to fill the vacancy quickly a White House official said Tuesday night Whomever Mr Trump chooses will be subject to Senate confirmationDemocrats quickly coalesced around a call for an independent prosecutor to take over the investigation into Russian meddling in the election expressing distrust in the Justice DepartmentThe only way the American people can have faith in this investigation is for it to be led by a fearless independent special prosecutor said the Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer Democrat of New YorkAdvertisementAs Republican lawmakers learned of the firing Tuesday night in scattershot fashion no unified party message emerged Some backed Mr Trump and expressed support for a new start Others were dubiousGiven the recent controversies surrounding the Director I believe a fresh start will serve the FBI and the nation wellIve spent the last several hours trying to find an acceptable rationale for the timing of Comeys firing I just cant do itThe Senate Intelligence Committee which is conducting its own investigation into Russian tampering in the election has faced mounting calls for an independent investigator that were until now largely partisanMr Comeys firing upended the politics of the committee and prompted some Republicans to echo those sentimentsAdvertisementSenator Mark Warner of Virginia the top Democrat on the committee would not say when or if subpoenas might comeUntil Mr Trump appoints a new director the deputy director Andrew G McCabe will oversee the FBI including the continuing Russia investigationWhile the director is not usually involved in the daytoday operations of the Russia investigation whomever Mr Trump selects as the next director will have the ability to influence the investigation by adding or pulling resourcesThe new director will also have to confront the task of winning over rankandfile agents While some of Mr Comeys decisions were controversial he was popular among the staff and the public way that he learned about his termination  from a television screen while he was speaking to FBI employees in Los Angeles  will probably stay in their mindsReporting was contributed by Julie Hirschfeld Davis Carl

20,AdvertisementIf you want to know just how big Star Wars was in 1977 consider the story of the empty toy boxA roundup of details about the new Star Wars film which picks up 30 years after the events of Return of the JediStar Wars memories from Sam Rockwell Sarah Vowell Ridley Scott Saoirse Ronan and Senator Ted Cruz among othersMr Lucas always knew his audience In April 1977 the month before Star Wars opened American Film magazine ran an interview in which he talked about who he wanted to reach Rather than do some angry socially relevant film he said I realized that there was another relevance that is even more important  dreams and fantasies getting children to believe there is more to life than garbage and killing and all that real stuff like stealing hubcaps  that you could still sit and dream about exotic lands and strange creatures His influences were a postmodern grab bag from samurai films to John Carter of Mars Years later Joseph Campbell was worked into the conversation too Crucially Mr Lucas said I wanted to make a childrens movie to go the Disney routeAdvertisementAmid the gush there were doubts In The Village Voice Molly Haskell wrote what I find mildly depressing about Star Wars is that it seems to address itself like more and more television programming to a family market defined by its prepubescent age level somewhere between 10 and 14 She added Lucas bridges the generation gap simply by providing a oneway ticket back to adolescence The accusation that the film infantilizes its audience stuck In 1996 the critic David Thomson lamented the immaturity of the contemporary movie scene that he traced to Jaws and Star Wars I fear the medium has sunk beyond anything we dreamed of leaving us stranded a race of dreamers he wrote This is something like the loss of feeling and I blame Spielberg and LucasAdvertisementThe charge that these two wonder kids as Mr Thomson called them effectively destroyed the movies and perhaps even our love for them has been repeated so often that it became a neararticle of faith in some cinephile quarters Its a story that begins in the mid1960s when the big studios were gasping their last breath having never recovered from the introduction of television or the governmentforced sale of their theaters Run by doddering old men who catastrophically banked on pricey flops like Doctor Dolittle the studios were rescued by mostly young white male executives and auteurs who beginning in 1967 with Bonnie and Clyde shook up the industry and country with exciting images and a sense of real life that while indebted to European art cinema was essentially AmericanThe release of Jaws in 1975 and Star Wars two years later has often been blamed for bringing an end to these creative good times paving the way for the blockbuster bloat and sequel spectacle that now defines mainstream cinema and for some transforming Mr Lucas from a New Hollywood Anakin Skywalker into the Darth Vader of American cinema Like Star Wars this story is as simple as an old Bmovie shootout except one in which the good guys the likes of Hal Ashby and Robert Towne lose to the bad Mr Lucas Steven Spielberg and the suitsThat doesnt mean theres not some truth in the tale only that its complicated The late 1960s and early 70s had their screen glories but its an era that was as dominated by The Jungle Book and The Trial of Billy Jack as by The Graduate and Chinatown And even as critics and audiences embraced bold visions on screen some of the most significant shifts took place in boardrooms between 1966 and 69 when four of the seven Hollywood studios were bought by nonmedia conglomerates that as the film historian Tom Schatz has suggested were the antecedents to the media giants of today These conglomerates allowed the studios to keep the machine going and they also laid the foundation of the global entertainment industry as it now existsWhen Jaws opened amid a blizzard of advertising in the summer of 1975 in 400 or so theaters a large number at the time it set the course for the contemporary blockbuster And then Star Wars hit Fox was banking on Star Wars but didnt think it would be especially big which may be why it made one of the worst deals in industry history Burned by his experience with Universal while making American Graffiti Mr Lucas demanded  and got  extraordinary control over Star Wars By the time his negotiations with Fox were over he owned the rights to its sequels and the merchandising though the studio did receive a cut of every Darth Vader mask and Chewy figurine Fox has retained the distribution rights to the first film now often known as Episode IV  A New Hope in perpetuityAdvertisementSee More Go to Home Page,movies,"['advertisementif', 'you', 'want', 'to', 'know', 'just',

ubiquitous as they are in say some of the tonier districts of London have become the face of a sharpening debate about the impact of New Yorks piedterre economyAdvertisementThis building has so many Russians its unbelievable said Stratos Costalas a real estate broker with Oxford Property Group who has sold apartments in the buildingThere is evidence of even more Russian owners but their identities are so carefully concealed that The Times was unable to definitively identify themFor example even the longtime renters of Apartment 63B in the south tower do not know the names of their landlords though they believe they are Russian Records show that the legal owner is a company called Daloa Group Holdings but from there the trail goes coldMany of the Russians whom The Times was able to identify at the Time Warner Center were players in the epic deals of the Yeltsin era that privatized vast hulking state companies and created the countrys most powerful oligarchs And quite a few of their stories circle through that of Mr VavilovMr Vavilov did not respond to requests for an interview for this article Nor did he speak up publicly a few years ago when a mysterious media blitz of charges and countercharges broke out involving a longtime adversary a financier and former Russian lawmaker named Ashot Egiazaryan who was seeking political asylum in the United StatesIt turns out that Mr Vavilov was at the center of the byzantine affair Seed money for the media campaign came from bags of cash Mr Vavilov had lying around his Moscow home according to a deposition from a subsequent defamation lawsuit in New York Mr Vavilov was neither plaintiff nor defendant in the litigation but by the time it was over in 2014 he had quietly spent more than 1 million in legal feesMr Vavilov 54 looks every bit the ivory tower economist with closely cropped graying hair and wirerimmed glasses He has a PhD from the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute in Moscow and is a visiting senior scholar in the economics department at Pennsylvania State UniversityAdvertisementIf the path was circuitous it was quite by design that the couple ended up with one of the showiest condos in New YorkAs The Times wrote in the first part of this series while shell companies like limited liability companies and trusts can be used for secrecy they are frequently used for other purposes including avoiding exposure to lawsuits or double taxation They are also used in multiparty real estate transactions This was the case several years ago with family members of a reporter on this project Louise Story And they are used in inheritance matters and  investment strategiesMr Vavilov stated in no uncertain terms that he wished to own the largest and most expensive apartment at the Plaza according to documents filed in a subsequent lawsuit over the saleOne was to redecorate the Airbus jet Another was the redesign of what was to be the couples interim residence while the apartments at the Plaza were under construction  Apartment 70B in the Time Warner Centers north tower The couple had purchased the 3000squarefoot condo in 2007 for 13 million through another shell corporation  TW70B Inc The decoration of 70B was to be a test before Mr Slatkin set out on the largest and final project  decorating the Plaza penthouses that were to be their permanent New York residenceIn late June the couple conducted a walkthrough of the Plaza penthouses before closing It was during this visit that Ms Tsaregradskaya expressed her displeasure complaining that the apartments were not large enough among other things Several weeks later the couple refused to close alleging that the apartments design and construction did not measure up to what had been advertised The developer said it would keep their 107 million security depositIn a lawsuit filed in August 2008 the corporations Penthouse 2009 Inc and Penthouse 2011 Inc complained that the apartments at the Plaza resembled attics with low ceilings unsightly air conditioning units and inferior bathroom tile Their lawyer in a news release accused the developer of a bait and switchAdvertisementMy client was led to believe that it would receive one of the most luxurious apartments in New York history it got far less than what it bargained for the lawyer Y David Scharf saidThe suit was ultimately settled Mr Vavilov and Ms Tsaregradskaya later had a falling out with Mr Slatkin as well and an arbitrator directed him to repay more than 3 millionIn May 2009 deeming the Plaza not up to their standards the couple entered into a 375 million contract for PH78 at the Time Warner Center property records showThe buyer was registered under the name SoutherndownNo one was ever arrested and the blast was never explained But in the brutal political infighting of that time Mr Vavilov was a man with a certain number of enemies a man surrounded by suspicionMr Vavilov had joined the Finance Ministry in 1992 one of a handful of idealistic freemarket economists embracing a capitalist model in the early days of the Russian Federation He was only 31 but was already regarded as a leading expert in finance The year before he had cut short a fellowship at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington to return home and help shape the parameters of a marketbased system for the young republicMr Vavilovs primary portfolio as deputy finance minister though lay elsewhereAs the person responsible for all government expenditures and revenues in foreign currencies Mr Vavilov shouldered enormous responsibility for the daytoday execution of financial transactions He also managed debt issues as Russia sought to renegotiate billions of dollars in loans to international creditors held over from the Soviet Union as well as to collect on debts owed to it by former client statesAdvertisementWhere he wielded the greatest power though was in selecting banks that would win government deposits With the oligarchic bank owners vying for these assets Mr Vavilov was in a position not only to distribute the cash and highyield government notes but also to shape the terms in an emerging market with few regulationsAlthough he played little direct role in the privatization process this access to money was essential for banks in the competition to acquire the gems of the former Soviet stateHe decided how much deposits to place in which banks coincident at the same time with privatization said one person knowledgeable about Mr Vavilovs time in office who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of repercussionsShare your views and submit questions for the reporters Louise Story and Stephanie Saul who will respond to selected reader queriesIn 2001 after the recently elevated Mr Putin began recentralizing industry vowing to eliminate as a class the Yeltsinera oligarchs the Russian Parliament began investigating a host of the former presidents ministers The review included a detailed look at Mr Vavilovs tenure at the Finance MinistryAmong the issues under scrutiny was a 1996 agreement that had permitted Ukraine to pay a natural gas debt to Russia with construction materials Of 450 million in materials supposed to have been shipped to the Russian Defense Ministry to pay off the loan only 123 million worth arrived investigators saidA Russian general was tried and sent to prison At trial he argued that he was being made the fall guy for highranking ministers and he pointed the finger at Mr Vavilov as the signatory on the arrangementMr Vavilov denied wrongdoing and the case against him was droppedSoon after Mr Vavilov left the Finance Ministry in spring 1997 the chairman of Russias Central Bank alleged that the money instead of being transferred directly to the jet manufacturers account had been diverted through accounts at several banks in the form of government bonds known for their particularly beneficial terms to bankersAdvertisementMr Vavilov denied wrongdoing saying the money had been deposited in the manufacturers account and had been spent appropriately The case against him was closed but the allegations festered until 2007 when it was reopened and the Russian Supreme Court upheld charges of fraud and abuse of office clearing the way for Mr Vavilovs arrestBy then however he had become a senator complicating the case because the position confers parliamentary immunity The statute of limitations eventually expired and the case was dropped in 2008You never know whats going on who is guilty or not but they made a very good public case against him said Bernard Sucher an American who worked for 20 years in Russian bankingHe invoked the story of Alexander Hamilton the Treasury secretary in the early days of the American republic who died in a duel with Aaron BurrBecause of my tough position I became the subject of a hysterical and dirty campaign in the mass media that was controlled by the oligarchs Mr Vavilov wrote Duels in modern times are not permitted and there is no place for heroism in the spirit of Alexander Hamilton The only possible response to the insinuations in the mass media was my decision to resign at the beginning of 1997Unexplained in his book was his decision upon leaving government to become president of an affiliate of Uneximbank which had been founded by one of the authors  and chief beneficiaries  of Loans for Shares Vladimir Potanin In 1995 in one of the programs most notorious auctions Mr Potanins bank won virtual control of the mining giant Norilsk NickelDespite Mr Vavilovs close association with the Yeltsin administration much of his wealth was acquired later as Mr Putins government was consolidating the nations oil industry in one stateaffiliated super company RosneftPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersAdvertisementIn an interview with The Times in 2007 Mr Vavilov said of Severnaya Neft It was a big achievement for me from all points of view When I bought the company nobody even took it seriously It became one of the fastestgrowing companies in the countryEven so Mr Vavilovs critics look back over his career and see a classic transformation story of that Russian eraThe issue with Vavilov is that he was one of the reformers who switched to the oligarchic side said Anders Aslund a Swedish economist who is a senior fellow at the Peterson InstituteAt the Time Warner Center Mr Vavilov and Ms Tsaregradskaya needed little introduction particularly in the ultraexpensive top floors where a number of the Russian owners were linked through a tangled  one might even say Dostoevskian  web of relationships and business dealsBefore buying at the Time Warner Center Mr Vavilov had visited the unit of Oleg Baybakov whose family members have owned three Time Warner Center apartments at various times Mr Baybakov made part of his fortune as an executive of Norilsk Nickel the mining company acquired for a fraction of its value in the Loans for Shares program In fact he is one of several Time Warner owners with ties to the Norilsk deal in which one of the winning partners was Mikhail Prokhorov now a visible figure in New York as principal owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball teamMr Baybakov is primarily known in New York through his daughter Maria Baibakova a young socialite and artscene fixture Before helping foster his daughters art career however Mr Baybakov had sought to establish her in the restaurant business After plans for a downtown restaurant called Fum fell apart Mr Baybakovs restaurant company sued his business partner to recoup his investment and collect 75000 left in escrowWhen advised by one of the lawyers that the legal fees might exceed the amount in escrow Mr Baybakov said he did not care I will spend 10 times more and sue you he told the lawyer according to a deposition In the end Mr Baybakov failed to show up for trial and so did his exwife also a partner in the business She also apparently evinced a disregard for the courts process said Justice Louis B York of State Supreme Court dismissing the case according to court recordsAdvertisementThe Baybakovs sold one of their Time Warner apartments 74A in the north tower to a shell company called Ff Property Management for 11 million in 2008 The Times traced the shell company to Maxim Finskiy also a former Norilsk Nickel executive and a partner with Mr Prokhorov in another mining company The apartment was sold for 18 million last NovemberIf Mr Prokhorov was a big winner in the Norilsk deal the loser was Vitaly Malkin whose Rossiyskiy Kredit Bank submitted a higher bid but was shut out on technical grounds At the time though another deal was on the horizon that would benefit him  an agreement to finance Angolas 5 billion debt that generated controversy because of payments to Angolan officials and to middlemen including Mr Malkin At the Russian Foreign Ministry it was Mr Vavilov who signed off on the dealMr Malkins lawyer called his clients 488 million payment a dividend explaining that he had held shares in a company that served as an intermediary in the dealIn 2010 a limited liability company traced to Mr Malkins family paid 1565 million for Apartment 74B a duplex in the Time Warner Centers south towerA member of an administrative council of Mr Malkins bank Vasily Anisimov has a connection to the Time Warner Center as well A penthouse there was purchased in 2004 for 98 million through a trust for the benefit of Mr Anisimovs daughter Anna Anisimova then a student at New York UniversityMr Anisimov made his fortune in aluminum in the 1990s He remains influential in Russia where he has been an associate of Arkady Rotenberg a longtime friend of Mr Putin who was among those sanctioned by the United States after Russias annexation of CrimeaPossibly Mr Vavilovs longeststanding associate in the Time Warner Center is Konstantin Kagalovsky In 1991 the two were members of a group of five who holed up in a dacha outside Moscow to develop an economic platform for the emerging republic Mr Kagalovsky went on to become Russias representative to the International Monetary Fund and later vice chairman of Mr Khodorkovskys company YukosAdvertisementThrough records and interviews The Times established that the Kagalovskys through a shell company are owners at the Time Warner CenterMr Kagalovsky who did not respond to questions for this article has become another of the Time Warner Russians embroiled in recent litigation in New YorkIn a lawsuit in State Supreme Court he was found to have wrongfully wrested control of a Ukrainian television network from his partner Vladimir Gusinski The judge ruled in 2012 that Mr Kagalovsky and his associates had secretly transferred ownership of the company to entities he controlledIn his decision the judge wrote that Mr Kagalovsky and a company executive had agreed that if Mr Gusinski refused to step down Mr Kagalovsky would take over the company using the traditional Russian and Ukrainian methodMr Vavilov was preparing to export his own Russian rivalry to America when he invited a Washington operative to his Moscow home in January 2011Mr Vavilov had recently learned that Mr Egiazaryan the financier and former lawmaker had taken up residence in Beverly Hills after fleeing Russia where he was facing fraud chargesWhile Mr Vavilov hated Mr Egiazaryan according to a deposition from one figure in the later legal case the precise genesis of that antagonism is not clear It might have been related to Mr Vavilovs former oil company Severnaya Neft in which Mr Egiazaryans cousin had once been an investor Or it might have been related to the longstanding allegations about the murky MIG case which included claims that money had disappeared in Unikombank where Mr Egiazaryan was a major shareholderNow tensions had escalated to such a degree that Mr Vavilov wanted the operative Rinat Akhmetshin director of a Washington think tank called the International Eurasian Institute to help derail Mr Egiazaryans application for asylum in the United StatesAdvertisementI remember there was money in like 100 bills bags Mr Akhmetshin would later testify recounting how Mr Vavilov pulled out 70000 or 80000 and handed it over  the first payment in a media campaign to discredit Mr EgiazaryanFor help Mr Akhmetshin turned to Peter Zalmayev who runs the Eurasia Democracy Initiative which describes itself as devoted to promoting democracy and the rule of law in former Soviet statesMr Zalmayev later acknowledged in a deposition that he had been paid 100000 but had not disclosed that he was working at the behest of Mr Vavilov when he approached groups including the American Jewish Committee and the National Conference on Soviet Jewry Both ultimately signed antiEgiazaryan letters to the State Department and the Homeland Security secretaryMr Zalmayevs strategy largely relied on painting Mr Egiazaryan as antiSemitic because of his connection to the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia headed by an ultranationalist By March 2011 Mr Zalmayev had persuaded The Jewish Journal a widely read newspaper in California to publish an opinion article he wroteJewish groups in America and Russia have repeatedly condemned the LDPR and its leader as antiSemitic the article said adding The US government must likewise put antiSemites worldwide on notice You are not welcome in this countryMr Ponomarev later rescinded the letters as a grave mistake and returned the money but not before a staff member of the United States Helsinki Commission a federal agency raised questions in an email exchange with Mr ZalmayevWhos orchestrating this wrote the staff member Kyle Parker after Mr Zalmayev contacted him to suggest that Mr Egiazaryan warranted attention for placement on a no entry listAdvertisementMr Egiazaryan mounted his own public relations campaign denying the charges of antiSemitism and saying he had fled Russia after death threats against him and his familyThe case against Mr Egiazaryan back home involved claims that he defrauded two business partners of 48 million In a recent interview with The Times Mr Egiazaryan said the fraud charges were drummed up by politically connected rivals as part of a corporate raid stripping him of his interest in a joint venture with the city of Moscow to renovate a Stalinera hotel near Red Square All the accusations are built on fabricated documents Mr Egiazaryan saidThe firms fee was 77000 a month plus expenses to develop a global media strategy for Mr Egiazaryan that portrayed him in a favorable light including a Washington program in support of Mr Egiazaryans application to settle in the USA notation with The Journal article did not mention the criminal case saying merely that Mr Egiazaryan was living in the United States for his personal safetyOn April 19 2011 Mr Egiazaryan filed suit against Mr Zalmayev in federal court in Manhattan charging that he had led a malicious disinformation campaign against him Mr Zalmayev countersued and in the end the legal confrontation essentially ended in a drawMr Egiazaryans lawyers had contended that one of their clients rivals in the hotel deal was behind Mr Zalmayevs campaign suggesting that Mr Vavilov was merely a front But documents produced in the discovery process and reviewed by The Times show that in addition to financing the media campaign against Mr Egiazaryan Mr Vavilov was covering Mr Zalmayevs legal costs As of July 2012 nearly two years before the case ended Mr Vavilov had run through more than 114 million in legal feesAdvertisementAt one hearing the federal magistrate Gabriel Gorenstein complained of the lack of monetary restraint on both sides Its mysterious to me as to why this litigation has ballooned to what it is now he said in a hearing Mr Vavilov he later wrote obviously has no interest in the integrity of the United States asylum petitioning process Rather he apparently harbors an independent interest in harming EgiazaryanMr Egiazaryan remains in the United States The Justice Department would neither confirm nor deny Russian news media reports that the United States had turned down an extradition requestAcquaintances say Mr Vavilov who resigned from the Russian senate in 2010 lives as a private citizen of Russia a status that makes him less susceptible to government interference He has no political connection said Sergei Guriev former director of the New Economic School in Moscow where Mr Vavilov has donated money and sits on the boardHis foundation has donated more than 1 million to Penn State where he is a visiting scholar He appears to relish that connection displaying a football signed by Joe Paterno the longtime coach in his Time Warner piedterre according to someone who visited thereThe penthouse was recently put on the market for 68 millionThere are signs that Mr Vavilov may be turning away from the United StatesHe has taken a leave of absence this year from Penn State I think important Russians just in general its the case that people whose business interests are in Russia now they feel very uncomfortable being seen as close to America said Barry Ickes an economics professor there who has worked closely with Mr VavilovIn an interview with the magazine Elle Man Russia which was posted in English in October on his companys Facebook page Mr Vavilov expressed disenchantment with the American people characterizing them as overly strict and hypercompetitiveAs for me born in the Soviet Union and grown up further in Russia in United States was built a cruel system a cruel community and people who are cruel to each other he saidMasha Goncharova contributed reportingTo contact the reporters email

22,AdvertisementIs it the members who vote on the Oscars the films the campaigns behind them or something elseOn Friday the day after the Oscar nominations were announced revealing that all 20 contenders for acting awards were white and that films with black themes had been shut out of the best picture category industry critics were asking how filmdoms top awards could be so narrowcast a second year in a rowBut the truth probably springs from a murkier confluence of factors both sweeping and granular from missteps and misjudgments in awards campaigns in support of individual movies to the systemic lack of diversity in HollywoodThe studios behind two films that focus on black characters Creed and Straight Outta Compton seemed to come late to the realization that their productions were awards contenders or proved unable to win enough votes The Academys preferential voting system also works against films and actors not selected as voters top picks And perhaps the biggest factor of all the industrys overall offerings Many of the 305 films eligible for Oscars did not demographically speaking reflect the lives and complexions of movie audiencesAdvertisementAdvertisementChief among the surprise omissions this year were Idris Elba projected to get a best supporting actor nomination for his performance as an African warlord in Beasts of No Nation Michael B Jordan the shining lead boxer of Creed and the biopic Straight Outta Compton about the seminal rappers NWA The star of Concussion Will Smith had also been considered a possible nomineeMake your Oscar picks and share your ballot with your friendsYet Concussion was overlooked entirely the only nomination for Creed went to a supporting actor Sylvester Stallone and Compton landed just one nomination for its white writers They were handpicked by two of the films producers Ice Cube and Dr DreNearly all potential Oscar films are the subject of expensive monthslong campaigns to woo Academy voters and some said Creeds campaign was too late out of the gate That film was released in late November long after campaigning had begun for other eventual bestpicture nominees like RoomMr Elbas exclusion was the biggest headscratcher not least because Netflix had conducted an extensive campaign including blanketing Hollywood with ads Though the films subject was tough and the fact that Netflix new to the scene was behind the film might have hurt itAcademy members and watchers said chances were voters did not love Compton enough or at least not enough to make it their top choice necessary for a film to advance in the preferential voting systemGangsta rap is also a hard sell to an Academy that in years past failed to give a best picture nomination to the Eminem drama 8 Mile 2002 or the widely praised Boyz N the Hood 1991 which nonetheless earned nominations for John Singleton its writer and directorAdvertisementDid anyone in the marketing department say Straight Outta Compton really has potential with older white men said Marty Kaplan a professor of entertainment and media at the University of Southern California Its a challenge in a group dominated by older white men to make it a contender without buzz among their peersYet this was also the same Academy that awarded best picture two years ago to 12 Years a Slave and named one of its stars Lupita Nyongo best supporting actress Its lead Chiwetel Ejiofor was also up for best actor But 12 Years a Slave had a narrative that resonated deeply with voters and the awards campaign included advertisements that simply read Its timeThe omission of minority actors two years in a row is an aberration in recent Academy history The last time there were only white acting nominees for two consecutive years was for films released in 1997 and 1998Cheryl Boone Isaacs who is black and became the Academys president in 2013 said on Friday that while she found the allwhite nominations unfortunate really disappointing she did not see a trend in the backtoback shutouts I dont think theres any pattern at all she said noting that good work was perennially snubbed at the OscarsPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersPart of Ms Isaacss effort to broaden the voter ranks has involved inviting a younger more diverse crowd to join the Academy which bestows lifetime memberships A good number of the 322 people invited last year were from abroad and one awards campaigner privately suggested that this group could be making it tougher for AfricanAmerican films whose stories might resonate less with international audiences But Ms Isaacs dismissed this notion adding that the international component of the Academy was probably too small to significantly shift awards trends So was this years shutout just an unlucky bounce A bounce I never want to see happen again she saidHollywood Mr Lee said shaking his head

23,AdvertisementOne of the great weapons of a democracyThis was how Harry Belafonte the performer and civil rights activist referred to the street march in a recent interview Mr Belafonte played a critical role in organizing the 1963 March on Washington which helped spur the passage of two major civil rights bills He is also a cochairman of the womens march set for SaturdayWhen thousands of women converge on Washington this weekend they will join a long tradition of rallies in the capital From the suffrage processions of the early 20th century to the Tea Party rallies of 2009 marches have drawn attention to crucial issues occasionally resulted in violence and often prompted opposing gatheringsBut the test of a marchs longterm efficacy she said is whether it energizes participants long after theyve gone home sustaining them through the less exciting aspects of change This is what shell be watching for in the months after Saturdays marchAdvertisementAre they continuing to be fired up when they get back Because there is a lot of unfun unglamorous work to do she saidAdvertisementWe took a look back at several marches in Washington and how they changed  or didnt change  historyOn March 3 1913 a 26yearold named Inez Milholland slipped on her white kid boots threw a cape around her shoulders and climbed onto a borrowed horse to help lead what was then the largest womens march in American history Behind her came businesswomen in blue writers in white artists in pink and musicians in red all calling for their right to voteFive thousand women marched while some onlookers hurled insults and tripped them If my wife were where you are a police officer told one woman according to this newspaper Id break her headWomen had fought for suffrage since at least 1848 But the 1913 march kicked off a series of political actions that swayed the public and male politicians finally pushing them to pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution By 1920 American women had the right to voteOn July 28 1932 Gen Douglas MacArthur and Army troops surrounded a group of protesting veterans in Washington wheeled tanks into position prepared gas bombs and gave the former fighters 30 minutes to disperseThe Bonus Army gathering in which an estimated 20000 World War I veterans demanded the payment of bonuses guaranteed under a 1924 law is among the lessremembered marches in American history The law had said payments would be made in 1945 but veterans reeling from the Depression wanted them earlier The event lasted weeks until President Herbert Hoover ordered the protesters removalAdvertisementArmy troops shot a heavy barrage of tear gas at the veterans according to The Times Two people died during the protestIn The Bonus Army An American Epic the authors Paul Dickson and Thomas B Allen wrote that the march changed the nation pushing Congress to pass the GI Bill landmark legislation that allowed many veterans to go to collegeThe National Mall swelled with people on Aug 28 1963 to urge Congress to pass a historic civil rights bill It was here that the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr gave his I Have a Dream speechAs he arose a great roar welled up from the crowd the journalist E W Kenworthy wrote in The Times When he started to speak a hush fell The paper reported that more than 200000 people had attendedWhen I get back there tomorrow Im going to do whatever needs to be done she told a Times reporter after the protest I dont care if its picketing or marching or sittingin or what Im ready to do itOn Nov 15 1969 antiwar activists streamed down Pennsylvania Avenue calling for a rapid withdrawal of troops from Vietnam Three drummers led the procession followed by people carrying 11 coffins bearing names of the dead Then came rows and rows of marchers 17 abreast shouting Peace now Peace now A police official estimated the crowd to be at least 250000 strong though others have said it was much largerAdvertisementIt was the largest antiwar protest to date But its success was less clear than the 1963 civil rights gathering In the aftermath of that march Nixon escalates the war Professor Mollin saidThe Supreme Courts decision in Roe v Wade which affirmed a womans right to an abortion spurred anger across the country particularly among religious and conservative familiesA year after Roe v Wade on Jan 22 1974 thousands gathered in

resist pressure from the White HouseI will never allow the FBIs work to be driven by anything other than the facts the law and the impartial pursuit of justice Period Mr Wray told senatorsAdvertisementThe hearing was a chance for Mr Wray 50 a private lawyer and former top Justice Department prosecutor to demonstrate that he was the person to lead the nations premier law enforcement agency under extraordinary circumstances Many of the questions from senators centered on how he would deal with Mr Trump referring to Mr Comeys tense interactions with the presidentAdvertisementSenator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont asked what Mr Wray would do if the president requested that he take any steps that Mr Wray believed were illegalFirst I would try to talk him out of it Mr Wray said If that failed I would resignHe also said he had no doubts about the intelligence communitys assessment that Russia interfered in the election a conclusion the president has questioned He pledged that if confirmed he would read the classified portions of the assessment as soon as he was sworn inPressed by Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina on how he would have handled the investigation Mr Wray said he would not have held a news conferenceMr Wray added I cant imagine a situation where as FBI director I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual much less talking in detail about itWhat you need to know to start your day delivered to your inbox Monday through FridayPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the

nationstate or any nonstate actor is the kind of thing the FBI would want to know Mr Wray saidMr Graham who has been critical of Russian interference in the election described the response as a great answerMr Wray said he played no role in approving the legal rationale for those interrogations adding that he did not condone tortureThe FBI is going to play no part in the use of any techniques of that sort Mr Wray said President Barack Obama barred the use of such interrogation techniques in 2009Mr Wray said he had not talked with Mr Comey in years but he recounted a nowfamous episode when he along with Mr Comey and Robert S Mueller III now the special counsel investigating the Russian meddling considered resigning from the Justice Department In 2004 Mr Mueller then the FBI director and Mr Comey who was the deputy attorney general threatened to quit the Bush administration over a controversial surveillance program Mr Wray also offered to join their protest even though he was not read into the highly classified programKnowing those people and having worked side by side with those people and knowing these were hardly shrinking violets in the war on terror there was no hesitation in my mind as to where I stood he said I stood with themAdvertisementFriends and former colleagues describe Mr Wray as lowkey and understated but exceptionally smart and thoughtful But Mr Wray warned those listening to the hearing not to underestimate him because they might view him as boring prompting nods among family members sitting behind himAnybody who does would be making a very grave mistake he said He added that he would resist any political pressure if confirmedI fully understand that this is not a job for the faint of heart Mr Wray said I can assure this committee I am not faint of heartSee More Go to Home Page,election,"['advertisementpresident', 'trumps', 'nominee', 'to', 'be', 'fbi', 'director', 'christopher', 'a', 'wray', 'faced', 'tough', 'questions', 'during',

and Larry Gagosian had this space it was a condo loft in a building on West Broadway By 1 am Id be somewhere like the TriBeCa No Wave club Tier 3 seeing the electronic Berlin band Malaria and then walking over to Daves Luncheonette A lot of the alternative spaces  Franklin Furnace ASpace  had music too Hearing hiphop on the street minimalist new music free jazz  it all added to this fabric that was a landscapeHear Kim Gordon recount her first impressions of New York CityI was still living at home I was just out of high school I was preparing that summer to start my first semester at St Johns University We recorded at a studio called Greene Street Recording Studio on Greene Street between Houston and Prince I will never forget the day because I didnt tell my mother and father that I was going to make a record I just left the house on a Sunday went to make the record And I got in trouble because I didnt get home until like 1 or 2 in the morning When me and Run would go to each others houses and rap together we would go into the attic And when my mother asked me where I was at I just said Oh I was in the atticI felt like I was having the best entertainment of my life because people were going up and down the aisle going Loose joints  People were talking throughout the whole movie going Yo shut up It was just like the kung fu movies  they were the same audience The weekend that it happened I got a call at 2 oclock in the morning from the owner of the theater He goes What the hell are you doing to my theater Someone broke the front glass and stole the poster They put their names all over the mens room The theater had been trashed I said Im very happy for you youre selling a lot of tickets SorryI had a loft downtown on Walker Street one of the first buildings that went on loft strike We didnt pay rent but it was meant to be 300 a month The landlord turned off the plumbing so wed defecate into garbage bags and throw them out the window The first club I did with Shawn Hausman The Club With No Name was on 25th Street After three four months there we decided to turn our loft into a nightclub We blacked out the skylights and windows and painted most of it gold  very Warholian We had a bar and some makeshift situation where people would collect the door charge 5 or 10 maybe Money was secondary to being able to have this playground we could create We were such fashion victims Wed spend hours getting our outfits together  buying stuff at Canal Plastics Center stapling photo booth pictures onto our jackets You couldnt get people to go to a club before midnight You wanted to be there when it was happening and then youd migrate at around 230 to an afterhours club It was a small scene people like writer Stephen Saban Keith Haring JeanMichel Basquiat and Kenny Scharf But preAIDS anyway it was also more diverse It would be drag queens with punk kids musicians and artists  everyone The Mudd Club was right around the corner going full throttle There was a lot of crossover because ours would go to 6 or 7 in the morning  some godawful time Wed go to bed among the broken glass booze and old cigarettesHear Eric Goode remember when he found out about AIDSI enrolled at the Parsons School of Design in 1982 My dormitory was at the corner of East 14th Street and Union Square The room I shared with two other students was on the top floor of the building facing the park Coming from China I was eager to be accepted in this new environment which felt like a monstrous machine  indifferent its frenetic energy fueled by ambition I did not know what my passions or imagination would lead to I tried to focus on my artMy sense of time was completely distorted I had no reason to stay awake or to fall asleep I slept when I was exhausted and awoke when I was refreshed I existed like a soldier preparing for combat But where was the battlefieldI would often wake up in the middle of the night as the city slept Separated from the commotion of the day I would stretch my own canvases and start to paint in the dormitorys common room The quiet and space afforded clarity My habit must have appeared bizarre to my peers Pretty girls in pajamas peeked in on my occupied space They would shy away with confused expressions whispering to their friends Others would drop by out of curiosity and wonder what was on my mindHonestly my mind was empty but I wanted to be consumed by that emptiness I spent a decade in New York City like thatI really had no business buying my loft on West Broadway in those years I had the gallery in LA and I had just bought a house in Venice so I was completely overextended and it worried me But I did it anyway I just wanted to be in New York It felt like there was all this dangerous energy I started spending a third of my time thereThe loft was across the street from Castelli Gallery It was raw It had been a paper storage facility I didnt have the scratch to make it livable but I met this guy named Peter Marino the architect and designer in the elevator who was doing a highend renovation on the top floor and negotiated with him He was in his preppy stage in those days wearing buttondowns which really is hard to imagine now I made a deal for him to do a cheapo job by trading a Brice Marden plus 10000 I made sure there was a hot tub in thereI did shows in there at night including the first solo show David Salle ever had We would go till 4 am Hell we would go past 4 am There would be 200 people in there You could say I was not a considerate neighborI was still riding a little bit high off of the Diana Ross album Diana which had come out in 1980 Even though every single record Id put out up until then was gold platinum or multiple platinum Diana was the first time Id ever worked with a big star Everything was different for me I met David Bowie in 1982 at the Continental on West 25th Street which had just opened I drove up in my Maserati Bora at around 5 oclock in the morning and walked in with Billy Idol who was a buddy of mine And right away we see David Bowie wearing a suit and sitting completely by himself in one of the hottest new clubs in the city Youd think he would have been the most outrageouslooking person there but he looked like a businessman Everywhere else it was club kids and bboys with foxtails hanging from their clothes I had the shoulder pads and the spiky hair and all that In retrospect Bowie was ahead of the curve Nobody was talking to him probably because they didnt recognize him I went over and started chatting with him and we became completely engrossed in this conversation about jazz We did a deep dive into the most avantgarde atonal jazz I couldnt believe he knew the same stuff I listened to as a kid in Greenwich Village My parents were heroin addicts beatniks Thelonious Monk or Nina Simone or Gloria Lynne would stop by to visit them so I grew up around these real bebop superstars And Bowie had no idea that was my background We were just taken with each other Within a few days he came to my apartment which is how I wound up doing the arrangements for Lets DanceWhen I was 15 I was in the clubs I was sneaking out I would get back home from school at a decent hour four in the afternoon By the time midnight came around and I knew my parents were sleeping I would sneak out the window down onto the porch I would be coming back around 4 430 5 oclock  sometimes 6 It all depended on who was playing Sometimes you would want to go to a Police concert but you wouldnt want to tell your friends because they would be like Thats so commercial and gross When it was the Dead Kennedys Ari Up The Slits Public Image Ltd you were all in full agreement I never had to show the clothes I was making to a buyer because they always saw it in the clubs first at Danceteria at Roxy at Kool Lady Blues Fridaynight party Thats where I first met the late streetstyle photographer Bill Cunningham I think The clothes were really like oneplusone big squares with holes basically And then eventually some surface decoration with tucks and treatment  Id take the fabric and just sew in any direction The object was to keep stitching no matter what happened to the fabric They were very basic but super interesting Everything had my initials on it or the name of somebody else on it it was really crazy I didnt know what I was doingHear Rosie Perez talk about her first time at CBGBSix days a week I arrived every morning between 730 am and 8 am I had just moved the gallery to Franklin Street in TriBeCa from West 57th Street I started JAM in 1974 to show the work of AfricanAmerican artists and other artists of color Galleries and museums didnt exhibit their work at that time A group of artists friends and a few colleagues including Marcia Tucker the founder of the New Museum demolished what remained of a former meatpacking company and converted it into JAMs new spaceThe gallery space was on the first floor our offices were in the basement This morning was no different than any other I unlocked the door But something wasnt right It was pitchdark I could feel the presence of someone in the room I knew running back up the stairs was a bad idea Never let on to a dog youre afraid of him my Uncle Charlie would say So I flipped on the light and said Good Morning How you doin this morningHe was young dressed in jeans and clearly shocked He had intended whatever conversation we were having to go in another direction Arent the both of us up early I said It seems we could start later than this Did you come to see the show The gallerys not open so youll have to come back Can you come back later Its a great show We stared at each other for a moment His shoulders dropped and he said Yeah We looked at each other again when I opened the door for him we were each wondering what had just happened Hey I said Have a good day His hands were in his pockets now He slowed and turned around Yeah you tooPM We refused to take a job We said we were artists and artists make art So wed be starving Sometimes I didnt eat for two days We were very very thin This was our morning ritual Wed wake up and if we had 5 on us wed go to the 103 Restaurant on Second Avenue and Sixth Street We could each get a full breakfast  scrambled eggs hash browns whole wheat toast with an endless cup of coffee  for 5 with tip And if we didnt have the money wed go to the matre d  it was absurd because this restaurant was in the middle of the slums  and say Can we pay you tomorrow and theyd let us Or wed go around to try to get breakfast from our friends ringing doorbells to see who was up They were more McDermotts friends because my friends were working in fashion and they were like Oh get a job bitch Dont come ringing my doorbell I remember we would go from person to person Wed say Theyre not up in the morning so dont go to them or They have kids so maybe theyre up because the kids wake up Wed visit people in the morning early Nine oclock was the earliest you could go If they didnt give us any food wed go off to the next personI had this idea I was going to be a writer if I couldnt there would be no point to my life I had reached 30 and was having to face how hard it was going to be It was nothing but rejection My life was spiraling downward I was breaking up with somebody  a long slow breakup We had a studio on Bleecker near Seventh Avenue I also had a tiny place on 12th Street between Greenwich and Washington  the top back room of a fallingapart townhouse that the owner was renting out I would go there every day to write By the end of the relationship I was living there It was all exposed wood and brick and it had a tiny fireplace a futon my books a sink and a stove It had no closets so somebody put up a bar so I could hang clothes The rain came through so the clothes were all messed up by brown streaks I tried to write every single day first thing in the morning 10 am Plodding I would write longhand sit down at the typewriter and type what I had take those pages across the room to a different chair sit down and work between the double spaces do another draft It was a kind of a monks cell I had no student loans and the housing was still affordable You could work then not work for a while get by Thats what I did I didnt want anything to be more important than the writingMy days changed depending on what show I was putting on what sort of rehearsal schedule I had and how late Id been up the night before though I had a rule for myself Always be back before sunrise My primary motive back then was to put on a show and anything that slowed me down from that had to be curtailed By 1981 I was no longer the manager at the East Village performance space Club 57 but I still helped out and performed there a lot The Ladies Auxiliary of the Lower East Side  sort of a punk rock version of my mothers Junior League group which I started with some other girls from the East Village  hosted several events at the club We had a prom a debutante ball a ladies wrestling night In 1981 I suggested a bacchanal  a night of pagan merriment as spring was coming So in April we held the Rites of Spring Fertility Bacchanal We made an altar to a llama and everyone dressed in kind of GrecoRoman outfits  I wore a toga with sequins Wendy Wild made magic mushroom punch We also created a percussive orchestra that was all pots and pans and a lot of racket and that was the debut of the band Pulsallama It was really like a combination of living theater and installation art very communal Thats what happened at Club 57 a lot We told people This is the theme Come be a part of it The doors would open and things would get going by 10 and by midnight it would be raging In the mornings usually around 11 am Id go to one of the coffee shops around the corner on Avenue A Odessa was one and Leshkos was the other People divided themselves into camps based on which one they favored  I liked Odessa better but Id go to both Thats where youd run into people share breakfastThe election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 is sometimes used as a marker of the beginning of the end of the art world as it was then known as if the two were somehow related as if an election ushered in some new aesthetic permission a new vulgarity which is really a kind of negative magical thinking I doubt if many artists experienced it that way Everyone I knew hated Reagan and couldnt wait for him to get out of office I remember being in someones loft  it might have been artist Brian Hunts  with a group of friends watching the inauguration on a little blackandwhite television The silence as they say was deafening No one could believe that this Bactor was about to occupy the White HouseI got up at anywhere from 3 to 5 in the morning and worked as long as I could I worked in my office at home an eightroom walkup on the Upper West Side It was a very different kind of neighborhood from the one I grew up in in Harlem  just starting to be gentrified The apartment was big but the hall was in very bad repair or at least looked it Mom says that your apartment looks like a crack den my daughter told me once A crack den lined with booksAt 11 to 12 Id had a ninehour day I would walk around the neighborhood go down to 42nd Street and do a lot of movie cruising Id go for two three four hours and have a fairly good time There was a theater called the Capri that I went to a lot There were others the Venus and down in the 14th Street area the Variety Photoplays a Spanish one called The Jefferson The Metropol Metropolitan Some of them were open 24 hours a day or they were closed maybe four hours a day for cleaning They were relatively small rundown theaters they tended to have a fair amount of drug use going on A lot of it was crack Before that it had been pot These places were used largely by workingclass men white black and Latino people who thought of themselves as straight and gay many of whom were amenable to sexual things They could be stimulated by the heterosexual pornography that was on the screen This kind of activity is highly socially ordered You dont barge in on other people thats all part of it I tended to feel particularly safe in the theaters AIDS was a very strange situation starting in 82 you knew very little about it and then a few years later you suddenly realized it was the largest killer among your personal friends It cut down a great number of the people who were out there doing it but at the same time the ones who were left were much more intense about it You werent afraid of getting it you were wondering when are the symptoms going to show upI held auditions for Fame the TV show on a Sunday at the New York School of Ballet because thats where I trained and Mr Thomas ballet dancer Richard Scott Thomas was happy to give me a studio I had been starring on Broadway in West Side Story and I had done the movie Ragtime which was also coming out but dance has always been my heartbeat So when they talked to me about playing the character Lydia Grant the dance teacher I said Yes I would be so interested if I could also be responsible for the choreography Because by this time I had been developing as a choreographer working with the Henry Street Playhouse and the New York Shakespeare Festival and I really loved doing it And they said Yeah you can have that  they werent even thinking about it They paid me like a tenth of what they paid me to do the acting and it became my whole life We were shooting the pilot and I was trying to find the best dancers I could They were supposed to be 17 or 18 Some of them were lying about their age and I knew it but I didnt care I said To hell with it Jasmine Guy auditioned she wasnt of age yet Bronwyn Thomas she was like happy feet on her toes She was the ultimate ballerina and she became that on Fame I was excited that I would be able to introduce this new band of gypsies to the Hollywood sceneColumbia Pictures had given me this SX70 camera at a conference and I started documenting life in the Fire Island Pines an area of Long Island known as a haven for gay life which just seemed very important to me Growing up in the suburbs of Chicago a boy like me didnt know there was a place for him in the world like that Very quickly I realized it had potential to be a book Two editors at Simon  Schuster thought it was terrific but they said You have to produce this yourself and we can possibly get you a distribution deal We cant put the money out for something this queer Then writer and editor Bob Colacello saw the project and said Andy Warhol has a threebook deal with Houghton Mifflin He has one book but he doesnt have the next two Maybe he could do your book under that contract So I went to the Factory and stood at a tall table with Andy and Bob and Andy went through the dummy It was almost a surreal experience because I had the feeling that this person is only vaguely here As Andy turned the pages he said things like Oh thats nice Oh that could be larger Oh   At the end of it he said Yes I think we should do your book Ive gotta go to something Bob will call you I took the elevator down to the street and I saw a phone booth and the first thought that came to my mind was Do not call any of your friends and tell them Andy Warhol is doing your book because I dont think thats for real And sure enough he didntI met Kim Gordon through a mutual friend Her upstairs neighbor was artist Dan Graham who I knew through the artistpoet Vito Acconci It was all very small towny She knew I was in dire straits by 1979 my landlord was getting squirrelly We decided to live together at her place 84 Eldridge Street It had a tub in the kitchen a tiny little toilet bowl in a closet of a room one narrow hallway room and a slightly bigger front room  maybe 210In 80 I got a job at Todds Copy on Mott Street Todd Jorgensen ran the Xerox machine in Jamie Canvas the art supply store in SoHo everybody went to It was the only Xerox machine below 14th Street so every artist used it As soon as he opened his own place I started working there alongside Sara Driver the filmmaker and partner of Jim Jarmusch It was sort of 11 to 7 Kim would work one day and Id work the next It was a total nexus Youd establish dialogue with great artists like Lawrence Weiner People like JeanMichel Basquiat would come in who was somebody you knew from Tier 3 and the Mudd Club someone your age I was like Oh cool youre doing art too Bands would put up fliers all over SoHo there were wheatpaste fliers everywhereI decided to start a music fanzine around 82 I called it Killer When Todd wasnt looking Id be running off copies and stapling them together Michael Gira the frontman of the band Swans was on the first cover Todd didnt like the idea that I was doing a fanzine He was very aware I was using a lot of paper that wasnt being accounted for so we came to an agreement that I had to payI got my first loft in what was called Lower Manhattan before it was renamed the Triangle Below Canal which was the realtors term that became TriBeCa in 1967 There were very few artists there I moved to Leonard Street and stayed there until five or six years ago when I was made to leave my rented loftMy first photo lab was called Hy Photo They were on 51st or 52nd between Fifth and Madison I would take my work from that lab  it was already mounted with dimensions like 48 by 72 inches 40 by 60 inches  carry it to the E train down the stairs then get off at Canal and carry it down to Leonard and up my four flights of stairs It was a walkup They had done mostly commercial work and I had to explain to them that this is different than their commercial stuff  to take a different kind of care And Im not a corporate client so please give me a break I couldnt work in color because I couldnt afford to make color printsTo me the 1980s were incredibly liberating I found them very original underivative of the 60s or 70s  they had a cleanness and a strength to them Id been divorced and on my own since 1977  I had started the business with my husband a decade earlier  and it felt like women were waking up There was an interest beyond becoming ladies who lunch Everyone talks about the 1970s as being the birth of feminism but for me the 80s were really about feminism in practical use The silhouette I was doing  broad shoulders and thin hip  was my way of reinterpreting masculine power but with humorWe used to have a TV with a VCR on at all times playing MTV and the guys coming up All the music in the atelier on 125th Street came from the VCR People would bring me their videos to pop in Theyd say Yo Dap listen to that All the hiphop artists came to the atelier there wasnt any other place that catered to rappers Those who set the tone  you had to have an outfit from me Rapping and fashion were being born at the same time One time a girl  a teenager maybe 15 16  came in with her dad She had made a video of herself dancing to LL Cool J Her father said Dap my daughter shes driving me crazy Could you just call LL so she could just say hi Everybody knew I knew all the rappers and everything So I call LL up and I let her speak to him for a few minutes And when she gave me the phone back she went into hysterics LL wasnt used to this kind of attention He said Dap whats she doing I said Shes gasping for air now And I go attend to her And then he asked me again Dap whats she doing Whats she doing now She was like hyperventilating I never saw that before  and hed never experienced that It was before he was onstage and all that he was just starting outThere was a thing I did every Friday night because my boyfriend now husband artist Carroll Dunham worked at Time magazine so I wasnt out looking for guys I would go to this rotary sushi place called Genroku This was every Friday It was on 35th and Fifth and it was a place where the sushi came around on a conveyor belt I had gone to a place when I was a kid called Hamburger Express and the hamburgers used to come around on a little choochoo train And I just loved that experience I loved things coming around and you had to grab them like getting your luggage off a luggage rack And the food at Genroku was really cheap which was the operative word Then I would go to Macys and go to the 10 rack There would be all of the amazing designer clothes that nobody wanted that were too weird I would then either go to work or go to an opening because Macys closed at 845 or something so you had to move on But this was every week And if I missed it I felt really badI remember the first time we went in and read A Soldiers Play out loud we were all just staring at each other going Oh my god this is amazing Two days later Adolph came in threw his script down and said Im ready And we all looked at him like Okay fine So we all threw our scripts down too because everybody had learned the play in like two days Two weeks later we were begging to let people come watch us rehearse And the director Charles Fuller was like No youre not really ready  you just think you are Everybody was anxious to do it for an audience so by the time we opened it was amazing It was packed every night it won the Pulitzer Prize that year Then there were the rumors that they were going to make a movie of the play and naturally we all thought Oh my god were gonna be in a movie But when the time came to make that movie they only took Denzel Larry and Adolph And the rest of us were kinda like Oh man what What the hellI was living at almost the exact point where the Village meets the East Village in the Colonnade Row building right across the street from the Public Theater I had half of the third floor which was sort of the highceilinged fancy room though it had long long since stopped being fancy My contemporary the writer Ed Edmund White had the apartment next door I could wake up in the middle of the night and hear his typewriter goingI invited him to dinner The conversation was very interesting Peter had no small talk at all Then it got to be a habit Hed come around maybe at 7 oclock Wed eat I would drink quite a lot of wine He would maybe drink half a glass of wine Having had an alcoholic mother he did not like being around people who drank much We would sit at this coffee table and listen to records for an hour Silently Or with only a few comments in between That is something I have never done with anyone else Patsy Cline Mozart One of his favorite pieces was the Alto Rhapsody of Brahms sung by Dame Janet Baker Sometimes I would read him the weeks work He had two responses Pretty good was high high praise The other was he wouldnt say anything just shrug  that meant it was a failureEver since I moved out of my parents house in Astoria to live in the city Ive always lived within the same two or three blocks of the Upper West Side In 1981 I lived on 79th and West End it was tiny but very comfortable Ive always been a pretty good cook and I could make these very good dinners in this tiny kitchen The Upper West Side has always been a great place to buy food with terrific places for fish and vegetables The apartment had this old refrigerator that didnt have room for much so in the winter Id keep everything out on the fire escape There was a place called Columbus on Columbus Avenue and 69th Street It was a restaurant  a modest place like an Italian restaurant  but really it was an actors hangout Youd walk in there and all the actors would be sitting around it was almost like a club and youd see all these people Danny Aiello Warren Beatty And then there were athletes and New York characters  a bunch of people who I didnt know what they did I just knew I saw them all the time At night if I was sitting around and wanted to amuse myself Id walk down to Columbus and say helloHear Christopher Walken talk about seeing movies  during the dayOne evening Kenny Scharf and his whole group  which included JeanMichel Basquiat and certainly Keith Haring  were hanging out at the artists studios at the Clocktower Gallery in the former New York Life Insurance Company Building at Leonard Street and Broadway They had gotten the idea that it was a very good headquarters It was on the 13th floor of an old city building and you had to walk up a whole floor from the 12th which was the last floor served by an elevator Certainly at night few people were there and few were there on the weekends So the artists would often have free rein and would sometimes sneak up to the roof especially for the Fourth of July and other events like thatOne night one horrible July Fourth I invited the board members up to the roof and I discovered 40 or 50 people at a party that I think Kenny had organized They were all drunk and wasted and they were happy And they were there illegally It was just shattering but of course I had to pretend that this was the surprise that I had brought my board to seeMy first loss was my partner around the time Grace Kelly died in 1982 I made a short performance called Life Without Grace a kind of eulogy The title was an intentional lure  the work wasnt about Grace Kelly but the painter William Schwedler When he got sick we were in a downward spiral for a year and a half How many spinal taps can you give to someone under a refrigeration blanket whose fever wouldnt break I dont even know if it was named AIDS at that point There were all these conspiracy theories People would drop change in your hands turn their heads when you tried to kiss them We didnt know how the virus transmitted Youd see people that you hadnt seen in months in the street with KS Kaposis sarcoma lesions people would just disappear Wheres Joe Eventually youd realize that he died and his family came and put his artwork in a dumpster Or his family didnt come and the landlord put his work in a dumpsterWhen youre at a memorial mourning the passing of a friend or a lover and theyre really young where do you put that stuff One of my responses was to just keep working I chose a very mournful elegiac orchestral piece of music and I created a grayscale portrait of three heads Bills head in the middle and my two profile heads coming out of either side of his It was at the Pyramid Club just one night October of 1982 before the floodgates opened It was a very quiet audience I went from area to area of the performance space onstage and offstage It was totally improvised like a live prayer Do you know that people are dyingHear John Kelly describe 80s styleRead moreWhat Happened in New

portrait of him tooBut then I glanced over to Renee Murawskis machine  Ms Murawski is the content editor for print  and she showed me the actual letter from the president which I hadnt seen yetThe letter was extraordinary he thought not least of all because of the second paragraph which betrayed Mr Trumps concern over the FBIs inquiries into RussiaI realized that including the letter itself was a much better solution than simply showing a photograph of Comey It helped tell the story in a way that was much more explicitAnd Mr Bodkins distinctive treatment earned high praise from readers many of whom took to Twitter to post photos of the page One such tweet posted by James Corden the host of The Late Late Show earned several hundred retweetsAs for the tradition of drawing the page by hand on green paper That probably dates to the days of Allan M Siegal a former assistant managing editor who is much revered in the newsroomAl always used a green pen when he was marking up copy so that people would recognize the source of his edits Mr Bodkin explained Im guessing thats where the green pad came about  it was his signature colorBut for Mr Bodkin whos been at The Times since 1980 there are also practical reasons for doing it the old fashioned wayI kind of know what this stuff is going to look like he said I dont need to see the page in any higher fidelity in order to visualize it I just need to work out the relative position of elements and scale  and thats much faster with a pencilAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bya', 'few', 'hours',

31,AdvertisementSupported byAfter enthusiastically endorsing an Alabama senators campaign for reelection President Trump distanced himself on Tuesday night from the candidates loss in the most Trumpian way possible He deleted his supportive tweetsMr Strange who was appointed to the Senate early this year after Jeff Sessions vacated his seat to become attorney general under Mr Trump conceded on Tuesday night to Roy S Moore a former Alabama Supreme Court justice whose candidacy was opposed by leading establishment RepublicansMr Trump and Vice President Mike Pence visited Alabama on Friday to attend a rally for Mr Strange The closely watched campaign was seen by many as a barometer of Mr Trumps political sway Mr Strange was the first candidate endorsed by the president to lose an election since Mr Trump took officeAround the same time the president was deleting tweets about Mr Strange he also deleted a tweet congratulating Mr Moore on his victory He later reposted that message and early Wednesday he tweeted about speaking with Mr Moore by telephoneIt is unclear why the president chose to delete the tweets he did Several tweets endorsing Mr Strange whom the president often called Big Luther but which were sent in the weeks before Mr Trumps visit to Alabama remain publicAt a rally for Mr Strange in Alabama on Friday Mr Trump openly wondered whether it was a mistake to campaign for the senator given his flagging poll numbersEven after getting elected president Mr Trump has maintained personal control of his Twitter account He has used his posts to skewer opponents respond to critics and he says to communicate directly to voters without the filter of the news mediaTwitter is a wonderful thing for me because I get the word out he said in a March interview with Fox News I might not be here talking to you right now as president if I didnt have an honest way of getting the word outBut if the presidents tweets are the Digital Age version of quips at the Rose Garden podium what then are we to make of the deletionsAt least two government watchdog groups Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the National Security Archive believe that when Mr Trump deletes a tweet he may be breaking the lawThe groups filed a lawsuit in June against Mr Trump and the Executive Office of the President claiming that deleting social media posts violates the Presidential Records Act a law that requires presidential communications to be archived The groups are also suing to require White House staff members to archive material sent through encrypted messaging apps such as WhatsApp and SignalAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'byafter', 'enthusiastically', 'endorsing', 'an', 'alabama', 'senators', 'campaign',

33,AdvertisementSupported byBEVERLY HILLS Calif  There are downsides to being a longtime actionmovie hero as Sylvester Stallone has found out Hes had four back operations two shoulder surgeries and a spinal fusion that one after he fractured his neck filming The Expendables Over the years expectations of his assumed athletic prowess grew so high that he stopped wanting to play golf or basketball with anyone When opinions about his acting abilities hit their nadir around the time he won a Razzie for worst actor of the century in 2000 he halfagreed with his harshest detractorsWhen you become synonymous with bluntforce trauma Mr Stallone 69 said in an interview here his basso profundo voice sounding like it was rising from the earths core youre not really leaving anyone with thoughtprovoking aftershocks of your performanceFor somewhat of a borderline misanthrope this is incredible Mr Stallone said Its the pinnacle of my life professionally Its so miraculousWhen Sam Jackson called me out on it I totally agreed Mr Stallone said Forgetting to thank the director Believe me Thats the last thing I wouldve doneIf Mr Coogler and Mr Jordan were miffed they hid it well I love the guy Mr Jordan exclaimed at an afterparty that night Then he Mr Coogler and Mr Cooglers fiance headed for the airport and Mr Stallones private plane which spirited them across the Atlantic for the premiere of Creed in London Sly was cracking us up the whole flight man Mr Coogler recalled Itll go down in history something to tell my grandkidsEverything you need to know about the contenders in one quick rundownBy weeks end the awards news shifted to the homogeneity of the Oscar acting nominations which all went to white actors That Mr Stallone received the lone nomination for Creed a film written and directed by a black man and largely about black characters only fueled the controversy making Mr Stallones joy over the recognition bittersweetThis guy here deserved it before I deserved it  this is his baby and I just hung on for dear life Mr Stallone said referring to Mr Coogler When he brought Creed to life he brought me to lifeAs talk of boycotting the ceremony circulated Mr Stallone said that he asked Mr Coogler whether he should not attend the ceremony He recounted this story again at the Oscar nominees luncheon on Monday I really wanted to get his opinion on what he thought my behavior should be Mr Stallone said He said You should go enjoy yourself and represent the filmIn a phone interview Mr Coogler fell silent when questions about the protest OscarsSoWhite were posed but said he was thrilled for Mr Stallone Any good thing that comes to Sly I smile ear to ear Mr Coogler said The movie was such a family affair Whenever anything comes for it it feels like a piece for all of usFor this interview Mr Stallone sartorially impeccable his face looking as hewn from granite as ever went to the fivestar Peninsula Hotel The place was impeccable and after sitting down Mr Stallone who comes across as selfaware selfeffacing and a little silly slid a plate of macarons and petit fours across the coffee table I bought these for you he deadpanned Very sweet of me I knowHe had met Mr Coogler who he described as a fullfledged genius a savant three and a half years ago before Mr Cooglers first feature Fruitvale Station came outThe younger director came up with the idea for Creed when his own father a devout Rocky fan fell gravely ill he has since recovered Mr Coogler wanted to tell the story of the illegitimate son of Rocky Balboas old boxing foe and friend Apollo Creed Set in presentday Philadelphia the film would explore the citys vibrant black culture through the eyes of Adonis Creed who seeks out an aged and ailing Rocky to train himDespite landing a meeting with Mr Stallone Mr Coogler did not think for a moment that the storied actor would agree to the film So en route to Mr Stallones office Mr Coogler stopped at a Best Buy to get a Bluray of Rocky II for Mr Stallone to sign The movie was his dads favorite and Mr Coogler figured he would never see the star againIndeed Mr Stallone was wholly unconvinced at least at first having been happy with the series apparent final installment Rocky Balboa 2006 which he starred in and directed receiving respectable reviews A recipe for premier disaster was how Mr Stallone viewed yet another Rocky film Yet there was a confidence and buoyancy in Mr Coogler that he intrinsically recognized Hes unspoiled hes unfettered with material success and hes hungry Mr Stallone said He reminded me of some other brash young guy in 1975One plot point spoiler alert in the Creed script that gave Mr Stallone extreme pause though was Rockys cancer diagnosis Mr Stallone didnt like it and didnt think his audience would either but Mr Coogler would not budge Mr Stallone said he equivocated until his wife Jennifer Flavin called him out She said Youre afraid to do something youve never done before Thats called being a coward Mr Stallone said leaning back in his chair and laughing She was rightHe figured his grief would be off limits but Ms Chubbuck forced him to drill deep You just feel responsible he said of Sages death That you werent there Here you save all these fictitious people and you cant even save your son Once that floodgate opened he said his emotions streamed out shifting both his performance and his mourning It helped Mr Stallone said I can talk about it now Theres some solace in thatHe has also found deep solace in the acclaim his performance drew from Hollywoods establishment Irwin Winkler who has been producing films with Mr Stallone from the first Rocky on said seeing Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg leaping to their feet to applaud Mr Stallones Golden Globe win was especially gratifyingIt would be a great moment for any actor and certainly it was for Sly Mr Winkler said I dont think they gave him respect for the last 40 yearsLooking back Mr Stallone said hes not sure how much respect he deserved anyway Appearing in action films became for him almost like an adrenaline addiction he said an endurance contest that doesnt challenge your soul at allNow I look at it in the cold light of day and theyre right quite honestly he said of his critics of yore I think the world could have lived without The Expendables without spinning out of orbit I really

After serving as Bridgeports mayor in the 1990s and early 2000s Mr Ganim a Democrat was convicted on multiple charges of corruption and sent to federal prison Seven years later he emerged from his time away as he calls it a changed manHe returned to City Hall as mayor in 2015 vowing to make his mayoral redux squeaky clean  even hiring as a senior adviser the FBI agent who was a key member of the prosecution team that convicted himNow Mr Ganim is hoping to pull off an even more improbable comeback He is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor amid a crowded field of candidates bidding to replace the Democratic twoterm governor Dannel P Malloy who is not seeking reelectionMr Ganim believes that his life experience will resonate with voters across the state and not only in cities like Bridgeport Hartford and New Haven that are troubled by crime unemployment and povertyThere are people in every pocket of Connecticut who are struggling he said Im second chance But there are people who are still looking for their first chance One thing I do bring  imperfect as I might be  is the experience of solving problems in a publicsector environmentNot everyone thinks that Mr Ganim would be an ideal nominee some Democratic leaders fear that his criminal background could damage their partys chance of victory in November even when a huge Democratic turnout fueled by antiTrump vitriol is expected in a state where Democrats easily outnumber RepublicansHe is the guy who did wrong came back and did right and now wants to be redeemed which is a very good story line said Hank Sheinkopf a veteran Democratic political consultant who is not involved in the governors race But he is also the one Democrat whom the Republicans might actually be able to beat come the fall Thats what the panic is aboutYet others believe that Mr Ganim 58 will do well at the partys nominating convention this spring They cite the breadth of his delegate support in Bridgeport a gritty coastal city of 150000 where he has earned praise for attracting development stabilizing finances and bolstering the policeEven if Mr Ganim does not win the partys nomination which requires more than 50 percent of the delegate vote he could garner the 15 percent needed for a spot on the primary ballot Failing that he would have to obtain thousands of petition signatures something he pledges to doDemocrats are saying Holy cow this cant happen  said Peter Spain a Democratic member of Bridgeports City Council and a longtime critic of Mr Ganim Its wrong for someone who totally betrayed the public trust to come back and shrug it off and act like the people of Bridgeport forgave himThat same year Bridgeport conducted a citywide tax reassessment that revealed a sobering trend The value of Bridgeports taxable property had fallen by a staggering 1 billion to 6 billion That  coupled with a 20 million budget deficit left by the previous administration  prompted the city to raise the effective tax rate on properties by nearly 29 percentAs he has traveled the state in recent months Mr Ganim said he found that residents do not necessarily share his critics view that his message only plays in the states urban centers They have a viewpoint that my candidacy may sell in Bridgeport but it wont in Mayberry he said referring to the 1960s sitcom The Andy Griffith ShowMr Ganim said he has been welcomed by many in the states more affluent sections noting that he too is a product of the suburbs hailing from a welltodo family that moved to Easton from Bridgeport when he was a young teenager Its not like Im an alien to the suburbs and my children live there said Mr Ganim who is divorcedIn a field of candidates short on household names Mr Ganims name recognition could in some strange way actually help him Many voters outside the Bridgeport area are unaware of his corruption conviction but might recognize his name just the sameSome 20 candidates from the Republican and Democratic Parties have expressed an interest in running for governorOn the Democratic side they include Susan Bysiewicz a former secretary of state Jonathan A Harris former commissioner of the state consumer protection department Luke Bronin the mayor of Hartford who was a Rhodes scholar and a treasury official under President Obama and Ned Lamont a prominent businessman and perennial candidateOn the Republican side candidates include Mark D Boughton mayor of Danbury Prasad Srinivasan a physician and member of the state House of Representatives Mike Handler chief financial officer for the city of Stamford and David M Walker former comptroller general of the United StatesMr Ganim had raised a total of 200000 mostly from small fundraisers like one on Friday at a cigar lounge in Bridgeport as of campaign filings through the end of 2017By contrast several Republican candidates including Mr Boughton and Mr Walker have already achieved the 250000 donation threshold with contributions of less than 100 each necessary to qualify for millions in grants through Connecticuts campaignfinancing system Another Republican David Stemerman a Greenwich resident who made his money in hedge funds had more than 15 million in his war chestAmong Democrats Ms Bysiewicz had raised just over 140000 and Mr Bronin who began his campaign fundraising late last year raised 113000 between Nov 27 and Dec 31This isnt a horse race its a stampede said William F B OReilly a Republican consultant Republicans should have no business running in this political environment but outgoing Governor Malloys unpopular tax hikes should make the race competitiveRonald Schurin an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut said that even with Democratic voters expected to flock to the polls because of their anger toward President Trump they had a history of splitting their votes between members of both major parties in ConnecticutEven while we were electing Bill Clinton president we were voting for John Rowland a Republican for governor said Professor Schurin who teaches a course on state politicsAs for Mr Ganims chances in the race Professor Schurin said he doubted the mayor would win the partys endorsement given the huge mountain to climb in the general election Its the most improbable scenario I could imagine he said But then I never thought Trump would be elected presidentAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementSupported byBRIDGEPORT CONN  Joseph P Ganim the mayor of Connecticuts largest city is selling a message of imperfection but also

petition signatures something he pledges to doDemocrats are saying Holy cow this cant happen  said Peter Spain a Democratic member of Bridgeports City Council and a longtime critic of Mr Ganim Its wrong for someone who totally betrayed the public trust to come back and shrug it off and act like the people of Bridgeport forgave himThat same year Bridgeport conducted a citywide tax reassessment that revealed a sobering trend The value of Bridgeports taxable property had fallen by a staggering 1 billion to 6 billion That  coupled with a 20 million budget deficit left by the previous administration  prompted the city to raise the effective tax rate on properties by nearly 29 percentAs he has traveled the state in recent months Mr Ganim said he found that residents do not necessarily share his critics view that his message only plays in the states urban centers They have a viewpoint that my candidacy may sell in Bridgeport but it wont in Mayberry he said referring to the 1960s sitcom The Andy Griffith ShowMr Ganim said he has been welcomed by many in the states more affluent sections noting that he too is a product of the suburbs hailing from a welltodo family that moved to Easton from Bridgeport when he was a young teenager Its not like Im an alien to the suburbs and my children live there said Mr Ganim who is divorcedIn a field of candidates short on household names Mr Ganims name recognition could in some strange way actually help him Many voters outside the Bridgeport area are unaware of his corruption conviction but might recognize his name just the sameSome 20 candidates from the Republican and Democratic Parties have expressed an interest in running for governorOn the Democratic side they include Susan Bysiewicz a former secretary of state Jonathan A Harris former commissioner of the state consumer protection department Luke Bronin the mayor of Hartford who was a Rhodes scholar and a treasury official under President Obama and Ned Lamont a prominent businessman and perennial candidateOn the Republican side candidates include Mark D Boughton mayor of Danbury Prasad Srinivasan a physician and member of the state House of Representatives Mike Handler chief financial officer for the city of Stamford and David M Walker former comptroller general of the United StatesMr Ganim had raised a total of 200000 mostly from small fundraisers like one on Friday at a cigar lounge in Bridgeport as of campaign filings through the end of 2017By contrast several Republican candidates including Mr Boughton and Mr Walker have already achieved the 250000 donation threshold with contributions of less than 100 each necessary to qualify for millions in grants through Connecticuts campaignfinancing system Another Republican David Stemerman a Greenwich resident who made his money in hedge funds had more than 15 million in his war chestAmong Democrats Ms Bysiewicz had raised just over 140000 and Mr Bronin who began his campaign fundraising late last year raised 113000 between Nov 27 and Dec 31This isnt a horse race its a stampede said William F B OReilly a Republican consultant Republicans should have no business running in this political environment but outgoing Governor Malloys unpopular tax hikes should make the race competitiveRonald Schurin an associate professor of political science at the University of Connecticut said that even with Democratic voters expected to flock to the polls because of their anger toward President Trump they had a history of splitting their votes between members of both major parties in ConnecticutEven while we were electing Bill Clinton president we were voting for John Rowland a Republican for governor said Professor Schurin who teaches a course on state politicsAs for Mr Ganims chances in the race Professor Schurin said he doubted the mayor would win the partys endorsement given the huge mountain to climb in the general election Its the most improbable scenario I could imagine he said But then I never thought Trump would be elected presidentAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bybridgeport', 'conn', 'joseph', 'p', 'ganim', 'the',

35,AdvertisementSupported byBenicio Del Toro shambling around like a latterday Robert Mitchum is the best reason to see A Perfect Day A serviceable watchable movie set someplace in the Balkans in 1995 this oddity was shot in Spain and features a tight largely Englishspeaking cast  including the American veteran Tim Robbins and two European actresses Mlanie Thierry and Olga Kurylenko  that seems to have been tapped to reach as many film markets as possible This talent sampler fits the movie which primarily registers as a wouldbe business opportunity for investment typesMr Del Toro plays Mambr an international aid worker who tools around the Balkan countryside trying to help locals while also doing his best to stay alive His primary comrade in battleground salvage jobs is B Mr Robbins a character whose cynical yuks suggest that someone here read Kurt Vonneguts SlaughterhouseFive at an impressionable age Mr Robbins tosses around his lines with amiable lightness like the professional he is But hes basically stuck performing secondbanana duties for Mr Del Toro who dominates the movie with his innate je ne sais quoiness a loose gestural performance and nice slow burns that never quite ignite a muchneeded fireTheres not much of a story which wouldnt be bad if there was something other than blasts of music filling the longueurs The action such as it is involves Mambr B a humorless new recruit Sophie Ms Thierry and their interpreter Damir Fedja Stukan driving around doing good works The corpse that early on they try and fail to haul out of a village well becomes the movies guiding visual idea one that the filmmakers return to several times though the resonance of this bloated body remains fuzzy The dead weigh heavily on this land Humanitarian efforts like Mambrs are doomed to failure One lesson is that these aid workers need to carry better stronger ropeA Perfect Day is rated R under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian Guns and trauma Running

37,AdvertisementSupported byBooks NewsOne can understand why Ian Buruma when he was announced as The Reviews new editor in May thought What the hell have I taken on But that only came after a happier intitial reaction I thought it was a challenge I would regret not accepting Buruma said The first feeling was a sense of euphoria of a changed lifeThe Dutchborn Buruma who officially took the reins of the magazine after Labor Day is an awardwinning journalist and the author of numerous acclaimed books At 65 he has little experience editing but a lot of familiarity with The Review to which hes contributed since 1985I felt it was important for someone to know The Review and Ian certainly had that the magazines publisher Rea Hederman said of hiring Buruma He knew Bob almost as long as I didA reviewer once called Burumas writing disarmingly reasonable and calm and this is precisely how he comes across in person We spoke on a hot August afternoon in the magazines headquarters on Hudson Street in the West Village Towers of books teetered throughout but the space was surprisingly airy and lightfilledBuruma sat on a sofa in a communal meeting space looking like someone ready for a laidback weekend in his polo shirt The time he spent in the office over the summer getting to know the staff and terrain might have been technically unofficial but he was busy making assignments contacting potential new contributors and learning the ways of a place that had only known the leadership of Silvers and Barbara Epstein the publications cofounder and editor who died in 2006Asked if he wanted to replicate Silverss herculean office hours which he kept until the end of his life Buruma just laughed Silvers did the vast majority of direct interacting with writers virtually lived at the office and dictated emails that read more like lengthy formal lettersIt was a monarchy and I think perhaps it will be a slightly more democratic operation Buruma said Certainly I think Ill be more collaborative One great strength of The Review at the moment is that it has a number of very very bright young editors who know more about certain things than I doBuruma said he was most daunted by the shift from thinking of the world as a writer  which is a rather selfcentered way of looking at the world Thats a very different mindset from finding other people to do things improving their thinking helping themHederman said he didnt have any trepidation at all about Burumas relative lack of editing experience As a writer Ian was thoughtful about editing He paid attention to the way his pieces were edited by Bob and others He had strong feelings about the kind of editing he liked and didnt likeHederman said Silvers thought of Buruma as a possible editor of The Review but Hederman and others also said that Silvers never expressed strong opinions about what should happen after his tenure Silvers like many who observed him seemed to believe he would be in his perch foreverBuruma intends to feature a more unpredictable ideological roster given the unprecedented nature of the countrys political climateWere not living in the same time as Nixon or Clinton or Bush he said Under Trump the distinctions that used to exist roughly speaking between left and right have become much more fluid People who may never have come within a mile of the pages of The Review 20 years ago might have a place in it now Everything will be looked at with fresh eyesIts kind of like being put in charge of the Parthenon Sam Tanenhaus the former editor of The New York Times Book Review and a contributor to The New York Review said If you change one little figure on the frieze it will be seen as earthshaking by the people who watch it so closely every dayHederman said It will be a different publication it has to be Bob was one person and everything went through BobSome changes are already evident On Aug 23 Elizabeth Drew a longtime contributor to the magazine wrote on Twitter Due to a decision I didnt make Ill not be covering Washington politics for New York Review Youll find my work elsewhereIn response to a request for comment by email Buruma said only We never told Elizabeth Drew no longer to write for the NYRBReached by email Drew said Technically they are correct that no one asked me to stop writing for them But she said unanswered letters and phone calls over the summer and other signs from editors at The Review made it clear to her that her reporting from Washington was no longer wanted I believe that an editor has a right to change writers the wisdom of his decisions will be for others to judge she saidThe blog is part of an increasingly robust online operation at The Review though the magazine remains more firmly anchored to its print product than many of its peers Surprisingly the magazine didnt see the significant increase in subscribers after the 2016 presidential election that other leftleaning publications did But about 130000 print subscriptions are part of a total circulation of about 150000 which has remained steady in recent yearsBuruma said he was enthusiastic about helping to continue strengthen the magazines online offerings He will also institute changes in the subjects covered however gradually I share many of Bobs interests but not all of them he said One area I think we could do more in is contemporary art for example I also think foreign literature could be featured more He hopes to publish more pieces about areas he considers neglected including Latin America and Southeast AsiaDespite potential additions in those areas Buruma provides a clear line of continuity for The Review He is also a white man in his mid60s at a time when the left is especially sensitive to issues of diversity in the media and elsewhereWe would like to be as diverse as we possibly can but the main thing is to maintain the quality of the publication Hederman said We think we can do that and be diverse at the same timeBuruma stressed the importance of featuring writers from various backgrounds but said he also wanted to be careful not to typecast writers by always assigning them to cover authors and subjects based on factors like shared ethnicity or genderMore broadly speaking the naming of a new editor for the first time in the magazines history is a chance for fresh recruitingI think the worst thing you can do as a middleaged editor is to try and secondguess what young people would like to read what interests them and then go off in some awkward way like the minister in a church who whips out a guitar and starts singing folk songs Buruma said I think the way to do it is to find young writers and then youll automatically move to things that theyre interested in and thats one of the ways of rejuvenating the publicationAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bybooks', 'newsone', 'can', 'understand', 'why', 'ian', 'buruma', 'when', 'he', 'was',

38,AdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsWall Street is finally waking up to the reality in Washington The Standard  Poors 500stock index fell 18 percent on Wednesday in the most notable reversal to the socalled Trump rally since last years election Stockholders nevertheless remain too optimistic about any policy upliftThe promise of relaxed regulation corporate tax cuts and investment in Americas crumbling roads and bridges under President Trump and a Republican Congress has excited investors for most of the past six monthsClinging to that cheery outlook required overlooking a plethora of warning signals not least the daily dysfunction in the nations capital and the possibility of detrimental decisions on matters such as trade There were also the slapdash efforts at overhauling United States health care and regular leaks about investigations into potential links between the Trump campaign and Russian meddling into the electionInvestors elsewhere have expressed a good deal of concern about the chances of Congresss passing legislation that might buoy both the economy and corporate bottom lines The United States dollar index is right back where it was in early November The 10year Treasury yield after soaring to 26 percent from under 2 percent has retreated to 22 percentThe biggest market slump since September means equity investors are getting rattled too For that to happen though it took news that Mr Trump had asked James B Comey then the FBI director to end an investigation into the administrations first national security adviser Michael T Flynn  along with the ensuing fallout which has stirred mention of the word impeachment on Capitol HillThere are of course other factors behind the stock market surge For example nearly all S  P 500 constituents have reported firstquarter results revealing average profit growth of about 15 percent according to Thomson Reuters data Interest rates are low and the employment picture is solidEven after Wednesdays wobble however bank shares have jumped by more than a fifth and the broader market is still up by some 13 percent since Mr Trump won at the polls That translates into a valuation of about 25 times earnings a multiple hard to justify without at least factoring in ancillary benefits such as a tax cut It should mean there is a bigger DC discount in storeAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

39,AdvertisementSupported byCarryOnCapt Chesley B Sullenberger III is best known for his successful landing of a US Airways plane on the Hudson River in 2009 an event depicted in the Clint Eastwooddirected film Sully now in theaters Captain Sullenberger is currently the aviation and safety expert for CBS News and he travels around the world speaking on topics related to airline safety and standardsWhen flying for work hes mostly in the passenger seat I still fly myself privately on shortrange business and family trips but Im on the major airlines all the time he said Now retired from his job as a pilot with US Airways when he flies commercial he has no particular favorite airline I travel on whoever has a flight going where I want to go when I want to go nonstop with the largest airplane I can get on Thats my strategy Bigger airplanes with two aisles instead of one provide a better experience overall and I think its more comfortableCaptain Sullenberger has a couple of tips for travelers To start with dont take more than you need That makes it easier for everyone As an airline family weve been through Europe with one rollaboard apiece for a week You just have to pack intelligently and mix and match He also recommends flying early in the day Especially in the summer time before the thunderstorms develop and the weather becomes more of a factor If you take one of the first flights out in the morning typically the airplane and the crew have arrived the night before When youre not waiting on an inbound flight there are fewer delaysWhen asked one of the most controversial questions in air travel hes honest I do recline my seat but not fully Especially if its a tight one or a short flight I wont recline it much at all I envision myself being on the receiving endHeres what he packs on every tripShoesI always bring good running shoes I try to work out time permitting wherever I am And on the plane I try to wear a pair of versatile shoes that are nicelooking enough to dress up and comfortable enough to do a lot of walking inMusicI have a varied collection of music on my phone I like a lot of the popular music that has a really energetic beat to it as well as some classical things These days Im listening to some Adele like Set Fire to the Rain And Azul by a guitarist called Jesse Cook Hes got some fascinating tunes Im also listening to Shut Up and Dance by Walk the Moon and Cake by the Ocean by DNCEPaper mapIf Im going to have time for exploring Ill find a good map of the destination city to take with me I love that It helps to really map where Im going to go and to see the big picture before I start outSunscreenI always carry a good sunscreen Especially with my light complexionFamily journalThis is something Ive done for a while When were traveling as a family I write down the most surprising things that we saw the funniest thing that someone said Its fun especially now that our daughters are a little older to go back and look at trips we took eight or 10 years ago Its kind of a gift that you get to keep enjoying as the years go by Because you forget Your more recent experiences sort of override all the things that you did before and you often forget those things as you move on in lifeAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported', 'bycarryoncapt', 'chesley', 'b', 'sullenberger', 'iii',

41,AdvertisementSupported byCommon SenseFacebook reported dazzling first quarter results last week Net income nearly tripled to 15 billion and monthly active users hit a record 165 billion But its a much smaller number that leapt out at meFifty minutesThats the average amount of time the company said that users spend each day on its Facebook Instagram and Messenger platforms and thats not counting the popular messaging app WhatsAppMaybe that doesnt sound like so much But there are only 24 hours in a day and the average person sleeps for 88 of them That means more than onesixteenth of the average users waking time is spent on FacebookThe average time that users spend on Facebook is nearing an hour Thats more than any other leisure activity surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics with the exception of watching television programs and movies an average per day of 28 hours Its more time than people spend reading 19 minutes participating in sports or exercise 17 minutes or social events four minutes Its almost as much time as people spend eating and drinking 107 hoursWhen you really think about it 50 minutes is a tremendous amount of time  its huge said Ken Sena a managing director and analyst at Evercore who covers consumer Internet companies Usually when a platform expands its user base the average time spent goes down because a lot of new people arent that activeBut the average time people spend on Facebook has gone up  from around 40 minutes in 2014  even as the number of monthly active users has surged And thats just the average Some users must be spending many hours a day on the site prone to the unofficial syndrome known as Internet Addiction DisorderTheyre doing a tremendous job of finding ways to keep people on the site Mr Sena saidFacebooks chief executive Mark Zuckerberg disclosed the 50 minutes metric almost as an aside during the companys earnings call last month But it could well have been the opening slide in his presentation because time has become the holy grail of digital mediaTime is the best measure of engagement and engagement correlates with advertising effectiveness Time also increases the supply of impressions that Facebook can sell which brings in more revenue a 52 percent increase last quarter to 54 billionAnd time enables Facebook to learn more about its users  their habits and interests  and thus better target its ads The result is a powerful network effect that competitors will be hard pressed to matchRanked by average time spent on the platform Facebook has few rivals According to the latest data from comScore the only one that comes close is Alphabets YouTube where users spent an average of 17 minutes a day on the site Thats less than half the 35 minutes a day users spent on Facebook based on comScores data which unlike Facebooks 50 minutes is derived only from users in the United StatesUsers spent an average of nine minutes on all of Yahoos sites two minutes on LinkedIn and just one minute on Twitter according to comScore No wonder Twitter is struggling to attract ad spendingPeople spending the most time on Facebook also tend to fall into the prized 18to34 demographic sought by advertisersGenerally speaking higher usage on Facebook skews to younger users and towards millennials specifically said Andrew Lipsman vice president for marketing and insights at comScore You hear a narrative that young people are fleeing Facebook The data show thats just not true Younger users have a wider appetite for social media and they spend a lot of time on multiple networks But they spend more time on Facebook by a wide marginThe surging popularity of Facebook and other social media naturally brings up some questions What arent Facebook users doing during the 50 minutes they spend there Is it possibly interfering with work and productivity or in the case of young people studying and readingThat data is hard to come by For one thing people dont want to admit in surveys that they are using social media when they are supposed to be doing something elseWhile the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys nearly every conceivable timeoccupying activity even fencing and spelunking it doesnt specifically tally the time spent on social media both because the activity may have multiple purposes  both work and leisure  and because people often do it at the same time they are ostensibly engaged in other activities according to a bureau spokeswomanThe closest category would be computer use for leisure which has grown from eight minutes in 2006 when the bureau began collecting the data to 14 minutes in 2014 the most recent survey Or perhaps it would be socializing and communicating with others which slipped from 40 minutes to 38 minutesBut time spent on most leisure activities hasnt changed much in those eight years of the bureaus surveys Time spent reading dropped from an average of 22 minutes to 19 minutes Watching television and movies increased from 257 hours to 28 Average time spent working declined from 34 hours to 325 Those hours seem low because much of the population which includes both young people and the elderly does not workThe bureaus numbers since they cover the entire population may be too broad to capture important shifts among important demographic groups ComScore reported that television viewing both live and recorded dropped 2 percent last year and it said younger viewers in particular are abandoning traditional live television People ages 1834 spent just 47 percent of their viewing time on television screens and 40 percent on mobile devices Among those 55 and older 70 percent of their viewing time was on television according to comScore So among young people much social media time may be coming at the expense of traditional televisionMr Lipsman of comScore said he was skeptical that social media use could be blamed for stagnating productivity or a decline in educational standards He said comScores data suggests that people are spending on average just six to seven minutes a day using social media on their work computers I dont think Facebook is displacing other activity he said People use it during downtime during the course of their day in the elevator or while commuting or waiting Thats the biggest driver of so much of this engagementFacebook naturally is busy cooking up ways to get us to spend even more time on the platform A crucial initiative is improving its News Feed tailoring it more precisely to the needs and interests of its users based on how long people spend reading particular posts For people who demonstrate a preference for video more video will appear near the top of their news feed The more time people spend on Facebook the more data they will generate about themselves and the better the company will get at the taskAs a company spokeswoman Jessie Baker told me The time people spend on our site is a good measure of whether were delivering value to them The better we do at providing what people most want to see the more likely they are to return to the app and spend timeObviously there are limits to how much time Facebook users can spend since there are only 24 hours in a day But short of that I dont feel theres any upper limit said Mr Sena the analyst Everybody wants to be the platform thats on all day kind of like some people used to have their television on all the time Facebook is probably in the best position because people are already such active usersAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported', 'bycommon',

43,AdvertisementSupported byCurrent Events ConversationIn their comments this week students weighed in on a variety of topics ranging from diversity in Hollywood and the Tide pod challenge to the Super Bowl and dealing with grief But the issue that received the most number of comments was school shootings and in particular the question of whether we are becoming numb to themDefenders of gun violence always compare deaths by automobile to deaths by shooting to rationalize these tragedies So lets peg guns to cars Gun owners must take a class before owning a gun Guns must be licensed and registered annually Guns must be insured and proof of insurance must be kept with the owner You cant drive a dragster on the street so you cant have a high capacity gun There is no absolute right to drive a car provided in our constitution and there is no absolute right to own a gun Guns are not well regulated so lets regulate themIn Boston there are a series of billboards promoting gun violence awareness One reads Americans killed since the massacre at Sandy Hook and has a live count of citizen owned gun deaths displayed I remember walking around a few years ago and being startled at the number When Sandy Hook happened and my mom told me I cried for days Just a few days ago when the notifications showed up on my phone about Kentucky I barely blinked an eye Of course my heart plummeted and I could feel humanitys downfall one step closer but there was no tears at church this weekend there was no announcement no prayer As a country we have normalized school shootings so much made books and movies out of them make offhand comments about how that guy looks like a school shooter that we are rapidly becoming detached to the horror that we call our homeI was in a school club after school just the other day when my phone buzzed I had gotten a News notification about the Kentucky school shooting I was so shocked about it that I shared the news with other people in the club I was expecting a reaction similar to mine but I was so wrong They simply looked at me and said so I was feeling a confusing mix of emotions sadness anger disgust The world is becoming more and more numb to school shootings which deeply saddens me I think that its because 1 it happens so often now and 2 it doesnt affect those outside of the areaAs a student I agree that weve become numb to the news of school shootings in the United States My high school has already had two lockdowns this school year because of students bringing guns onto the campus It happens so often that I think many feel powerless to stop them so the default is to either ignore them or solemnly shake your head in silence In some ways I think its an attempt to not live in constant fear while attending school and receiving an education because no one should have to But in other ways I think some wont take it seriously until it hits close to home If we were taking school shootings more seriously than before then there wouldnt have been eleven incidents already in the first month of this year Very few people take active assailant drills at my school seriously I think that is just an example of denial and how its hard to take something seriously unless it actually happens to you or someone you know Schools can do more than just increasing their security measures and frequently enacting drills They can also invest in the mental health and wellbeing of their students and provide the support some of them need in order to prevent these acts of violenceI feel as if our society as a whole has become a bit numb concerning this subject since it has become all too common ever since the Columbine shootings have taken place The stigma associated with school shootings has become now an option to many misguided and mentally unstable teenagers who want their names in the headlines  whether it to be for them to desperately seek attention good or bad I believe that the remedy for this situation is to provide effective counseling for kids whom exhibit mentally unstable qualities and to always have an emergencyresponding force on campus at all times In addition I believe that the state should mandate stricter rules around families which own guns Whilst I still believe that any family has the right to protect themselves with a firearm it is up to the parental figures to make sure that their children are kept away by all means necessary from any firearms in the house Schools families and firstresponders all have a key role in preventing situations like these from occurring and if the state could imply far more effective rules concerning entrance on campus counseling and school emergency drills I believe that we could see a substantial drop in school shootings across the nationOur warrior society glorifies guns and assault rifles in nearly every TV show and movie so we shouldnt be surprised that we place the constitutional right to own these weapons above the right to life enshrined in our Declaration of Independence We spend more on our military than any other country quite a bit more Taxpayers fund promotions for violent video war games as a military recruiting tool Then we act surprised when someone settles a score using firearms We dont act like we want to deescalate conflicts talk about problems or reach out to someone who is hurting We model a Wild West approach to problems  take ten paces and fire Could we model a peaceful resolution Heroes that use wisdom and conversation to connect and resolve issues A better world is possibleOver the years I have participated in a multitude of active shooting drills The typical procedures are the classroom lights are turned off classroom doors are locked and children are rushed to a side of the classroom that would be difficult for an intruder to spot through a window They have to remain quiet until the entire school has passed the drill However one I remember in particular was when my school was shut down for about an hour The school did not announce if it was a drill so we had to assume there was indeed a threat I was in the seventh grade I remember turning down my brightness on my phone and checking to make sure my ringer was off so I could text my parents and closest friends that I loved them very much just in case However I had an escape plan if I needed to evacuate or the shooter were to enter my classroom My plan was to either jump out the window onto the ground outside or rush to the other door in the back of the room I was terrified but I knew I had to remain calm Eventually the school announced the lockdown was over and I later discovered that there was a robbery at a bank near our school Ultimately I was relievedPredictably students had a lot to say about this latest internet sensationTide pods Who would have thought that teens would start a trend of ingesting chemicals we use for cleaning our laundry Its definitely a sad time in our lives when we have to lock up and monitor teens to make sure they dont willingly consume deadly chemicals There have been so many challenges over the years the ice bucket challenge the mannequin challenge the straight arm challenge the floor is lava the silly salmon etc but this is pushing it way to far Its one thing to raise awareness for ALS or embarrass a friend in public but eating Tide pods is just plain stupid It may start out as a joke but the consequences of eating Tide pods also referred to as the forbidden fruit is not a joking matter Dying due to chemical ingestion all in seek of approval and attention is an absolutely terrible way to die Its a pity our generation has to be associated with theses ignorant and foolish challengesWhen I first heard about the Tide pod challenge it took every tendon muscle and piece of sinew in my body to stop myself from looking up at the sky throwing my palms up in disgust and asking the clouds what in the world has happened to humanity for us to have been brought to a place where we look at pods of detergent and think its a brilliant idea to eat themThe internet finds imbecilic activities to do then challenges other people to do it with them then watches videos of other people doing the challenge and chortles at clip after clip of soandso shoving a spoonful of cinnamon down their throat or stuffing seven saltines into their gullet without any water or sprinkling salt on their wrist and rubbing ice on it We find dumb things to do because it gives us a few precious seconds of fame For an instant we become another challenge video on the explore page or the suggested sidebar on YouTube and the possibility of being Discovered and Liked and Commented On bursts before us like a packet of detergent being bitten openThen there is the other half of the population that doesnt think at all whose brain cells have very likely been replaced by bits of cinnamon and saltine from the previous and equally stupid challenges they have done These are the ones who take it too far These are the kids that went to your elementary school and jumped off of the monkey bars for the sake of Looking Cool and ended up with two broken arms and a chipped toothThe Tide pod challenge is one of the most seemingly innocent yet extremely dangerous challenges circling the internet Teenagers are attracted to these trends because they want to have a sense a belonging They want to be able to relate to people they look up to on social media by replicating their actions Even though most people know that this can be dangerous the sense of belonging skews their judgment for the worseLook this shouldnt be such a surprise to everyone Every year theres some new dangerous challenge that captures the attention of teenagers across the globe The reason being we find the discomfort of others funny Why do you think that fail compilations on YouTube have so many views or why the reality show Americas Funniest Home Videos consists mostly of people falling andor getting hit with something Its what the people want so the internet provides While this Tide pod Challenge makes me question the sanity of humanity slightly more than challenges in previous years its not surprising Its such a ridiculous idea  I mean who eats laundry detergent  that people find it intriguing to watch However this challenge has gained much more exposure than your average dangerous fad because the Tide pod challenge turned into a meme Even those who havent tried to eat Tide pods are posting about it Like the article said many of these memes are about putting Tide Pods on food Ive seen a real life example of this when a local donut shop in my town created a donut that resembled a Tide podThings like making a Tide pod shaped donut arent meant to be harmful and further spread the challenge but they inevitably end up doing so The only way to stop this fad is to stop posting about it because once teens see something has gone out of vogue they no longer want to do the challengeSocial media seems to promote new challenges almost weekly The latest obsession is eating a tide pod because it looks like candy and the liquid explodes into your mouth Let me tell you what else explodes the pain shooting through your body as these pods burn your throat and mouth Is it worth it to risk your life for social media views Last year 10570 children under five years old were said to have had exposure to laundry detergent packets These children see these colorful pods as candy or a treat While young children dont know any better it is just sad that young adults are stupid enough to eat something that could kill them Before you consider eating a Tide pod think about the 40 hospital cases that have occurred this year just in January alone because of teens willingly eating them Many social media sites are banning videos of people eating these pods and I support it all the wayWhile I admit that Im the first to ridicule every facet of our society that I believe to convey how much the intelligence gap is growing the Tide pod challenge is something that I cant completely dismantle in good heart Ive heard more adults ask me why kids are eating Tide pods than Ive heard teens talking about it themselves which is a sure way to know that its being blown way out of proportion I have faith that no one actually believes they can consume laundry detergent and be absolutely fine and those that do probably cant reach the shelf any Tide pods would be stored on The Tide pod challenge is reminiscent of the bleach drinking challenge in that no one with half of a brain would ever consider partaking in the challenge however the idea of both play into the suicide culture unfortunately found in many modern teenagers Not only does this undermine the danger of depression and anxiety it can also encourage impressionable young teens to possibly have thoughts of suicide as well So while I wont scrutinize the Tide pod challenge I do strongly believe that these dangerous challenges can be potentially harmful to the mental health of susceptible young peopleFootball has always had a special place in my heart It is a ritual that me and my dad do every Sunday When one oclock hits we sit watching the TV religiously until the games are over It is something that I love to do and that includes watching the Super Bowl in a couple weeks While I dont agree with the football aspect being out of the spotlight this season this will not stop me from watching the big gameI am most excited to see in this game if Nick Foles can pull off beating the goat Tom Brady Coming in for one of the best quarterbacks in the league Wentz Foles has been able to beat expectations and rise above some of the best defenses in the NFL Even the article believes that Foles is blowing up Absolutely everything is going Nick Foles way Philadelphias backup quarterback has looked like a superstar Even though I believe the Eagles dont have enough to beat the dynastic Patriots I feel like the game will be one for the agesBoth of these games were very exciting and very actionpacked Both teams had to overcome insurmountable odds to get to the point where they are at right now Whether it is losing your top receiver in the middle of the game or losing your rookie quarterback midway through the season getting to the Super Bowl is very hard Of course I am going to watch the Super Bowl because it will a game for the ages I have been watching the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles throughout the season because they have two of the top offenses in the leagueWarning Unpopular Opinion Football is the most overrated sport everIm a sports fan I love to watch basketball and follow tennis matches but you couldnt pay me a million bucks to sit down and watch a whole football game I cant stand the sport It is outdated barbaric and down right deadly It amazes me how despite how far humans have evolved within the last millennia men still injure each other in front of thousands as a form of entertainment Football is no better than a gladiator tournament or the running of the bulls Its a fight to the deathThis years Super Bowl will be no different than the other 51 before it Overpaid jocks will rush around a field carrying an inflated piece of leather as if it were their own child Cult like fans will be glued to their TVs clinging on to every play like their life depends on it And me Ill be in my room hiding from the madness Believe me I wont be anywhere near the TV during the big game except for maybe Justin Timberlakes halftime performanceI have grown up watching my idol Tom Brady Ive been watching since the beginning of his career with my dad I was born the first year of the dynasty of TB 12 and Bill Belichick I have sadly never been to an NFL game I want to see him play before he retires Watching Tom on TV go through so many offensive players and still continue to reign the GOAT is incredible I wish people would stop hating on him Tom is gonna win and lead the organization to his 6th ring The Patriots are like the Chicago Bulls with Michael Jordan Everyone wants to see them finally get taken down Never count the miracle Brady out The Patriots have always been a great second half team I am really excited we have made it again after the tough win against the Jaguars The Eagles are nextBeing a Patriots fan is brutal for 51 weeks of the year Even in the offseason I receive countless remarks mainly on how the Patriots cheated to win their games However Super Bowl Sunday and the following week can bring me the most joy an NFL fan can have Not only can I relish in the victory of a Super Bowl but my joy is impenetrable by any rude retorts Its a winwinwin Plus this year is extra special as Tom Brady can have as many Super Bowl titles as any other NFL franchise Additionally if he wasnt already he will be the GOAT in football and maybe even in professional sports Every year I watch the Super Bowl because in general its good football But when the Patriots are on the big stage I will not be removed from the couch So this year dont contact me from kickoff to the awards ceremony and well be on good terms Good luck to the Eagles but be ready for a beatdownBlindfolded and a duct taped mouth this man is oblivious to the world around him Some people may see that he is closed off to life outside the humming sounds of the red headphonesThey could feel that the headphones are shutting him up and shutting him out With blocked senses he has lost his ability to express himself However though I can recognize this counterpoint I believe that the headphones are actually opening him up to new experiences and new feelings he may never had gone through without them Everything except the headphones in this image is in black and white revealing how monotonous and plain life can end up being without the pop of color His cookiecutter hairstyle and a cleancut suit represent the boxes that society tends to put us in As well the blindfold and his mouth being taped shut adds to the ways life is restricting him from having a voice and truly seeing With the headphones however this man is being brought to life with varied colors emotions and flourishing in a whole different world outside reality In my personal experience headphones and further music has become my escape from reality Though my reality is oftentimes amazing which I am grateful for it can be difficult and hard to deal with Listening to music enables me to reflect as well as enjoy solidarity This piece of art represents a feeling to me a feeling of being trapped but then being able to let go and experience color through a different lens musicWhen first examining this image I wanted to not think solely about the symbolism I wanted to examine the facts about the picture itself One may think at first glance that these are regular headphones meaning he might be listening to something I noticed quite quickly that these are noise cancellation headphones This means he cant speak see or hear It can also be observed that he is dressed like a businessman someone with power After observing I then started to think about what it could be a symbol for I believe the meaning behind this is that this man could represent the managers behind all the powerful men being accused of sexual misconduct as of late The higher ups had to know something yet they allowed their clients to walk free This would mean they chose not to see anything hear anything or say anything Though that theory is very specific I also feel that it could be more general There are so many powerful people who see bad things happen and choose to keep quiet about it due to fear of losing their power When I went to read the article the first paragraph opened my eyes I knew of the Presidents many twitter scandals and I often wondered why he wasnt banned from the social media When initially thinking about the pictures meaning this completely slipped my mind though makes so much sense The use of the word complicit is perfect and is completely in line with my thoughts regarding the picturePersonally I believe that the image is trying to convey the idea that with all of the new forms of media and all that is going on in politics right now people are losing the ability to form their own opinions the just listen to what other people say and do not think for themselves or craft an original idea The fact that the man in the image only has headphones on and his mouth and eyes are covered suggests that all he does is passively listen to the ideas others try to force upon them and do not look at the situation themselves and try to speak their mind I think that this rings true especially nowadays because with the news stations political magazines and other forms of media trying to force their opinion into the minds of their audience the audience members have begun to stop thinking about the situation themselves and just take in what other people have to say about the issue This is very relevant because whenever people try to argue about a topic especially in politics it just seems like everybody is regurgitating the same point made by some news anchor or political analysts and nobody has their own personal view on the situation I think that it is very important that people begin to think for themselves again because without the ability to create an idea for themselves society is going to drift into a mind numbing state were nobody is even able to think for themself any more and there will be no variety in peoples opinionsThe image in the prompt shows a person who is blindfolded and duck taped on mouth that could symbolize many things but I personally thought it represents something like rumors that are shared because you hear a rumor but you havent seen what the rumor is or even discuss with the person to who the rumor relates to As I examine the picture the picture more I seem to realize that the person was wearing a headphone not only that but it was red while the other part of the picture was black and white red could represent our countrys government because it is republican which is red So I thought that the picture here relates to our current government and the steps that they are taking The image could represent that the people who fail to recognize the perspective of the government or are not able to talk about itMy first thought was how many teenagers and kids use headphones constantly and are cut off from society They dont have a voice in todays politics or opinions I disagree with this completely I love to listen to headphones to calm myself down or jam out in the car I think I notice more and I am more attentive with headphones especially in the car while listening to music Its great to notice where I am and whats going on outside I think that the tape over the eyes and mouth are symbols for how teenagers dont have a big of an impact on society as adults do Unfortunately I believe that this is true Let me explain There arent many platforms or places for teens to discuss situations or problems in the real world with adults or politicians Adults either wont listen or think their own ideas or better You could argue that there are social media platforms that teens can access Many adults and politicians arent able to see the comments that are made by teens because teens dont have many followers or social media sites dont show their comments I think there should be a better way for teens to put their voice out into the world and not be blindfolded by adults This is one reason I enjoy commenting in The New York Times because I know that adults and teens alike are able to access my commentsThe first thing that I thought of when I saw this image was that sometimes we are forced to take orders or listen to something that we arent allowed to speak up about We are sometimes forced to receive information and theres nothing that we can do about it We hear these things and we cant see them for what they truly are and we cant voice our opinions on them I find that this relates to changes that are being made today in the world politically The people of our nation most of the time are forced to sit and listen to what our president wants to happen We can try and reach out discussing our complaints but sometimes they go unnoticed We are forced to sit and listen to the new laws of our land without being able to say anything to stop it and without being able to see the long term effectsWelcome to America  home of the blind eye and the closed mouth home of the perpetually open ears perfectly coifed hair and pressed suits Land of the tainted minds and unoriginal thoughts where somehow everyone hears everything but says nothing We absorb We immerse We are always taking in even if we are not aware of it The headphones are a doublesided metaphor They are Americas security blanket  we can choose what we hear and we can make it agree with the little voice in our head and that can be all that we hear if we want it to be They are the buffer between the real world where things arent as perfect and poised as wed like them to be where opinions arent in perfect correlation with ours where there are voices other than the one that we feed our minds with Or they are world itself They are all we ever hear they are all we ever absorb they are all we have ever or will ever know and we let them speak for us The headphones become our voices and soon they become louder than the inkling of conscience inside of us Id like to say that I cant relate that I refuse to let the roaring wildfire of the world overcome the spark in me but I suppose in some ways I can relate I let the voice of everyone else the roar of television and the scream of media overtake me until sometimes I find myself tainted and unoriginal But I suppose in many ways every teenager every adult every American feels that way at some pointSeeing as how the Oscars went last year it would seem as though Hollywood is very much whitewashing the film industry However whitewashing has also died down quite a bit Since the uproar caused by casting Scarlett Johansson in the movie Ghost In The Shell directors have been making more diverse castings in all sorts of moviesFor example the three newest films brought into the Star Wars series gave fans new characters that showed off plenty more races than one In upcoming movies Disney is currently casting characters for a liveaction movie version of The Lion King and Mulan Both of these casting lists so far show only actors and actresses who fit the setting and plot of these movies Also coming up Marvel Studios has been flaunting trailers for their Black Panther movie which takes place in Africa and rightfully sports the African culture all while making an awesome superhero movieThese examples and more show fans that although Hollywood obviously needs some work there are movies and directors out there making an effort to turn Hollywood around and give the people whatwho they want to see on the big screenIn my opinion I think that Hollywood is becoming more diverse especially considering that the past few years of the Oscars have consisted of white nominees and winners However Hollywood is now creating new opportunity for everyone regardless of race recently Priyanka Chopra a Bollywood actor is a known name due to her hit series Quantico Similarly with the coming of the new Marvel movie Black Panther which marks Marvels first black superhero Something very exciting Ultimately people voicing their outrage at the lack of diversity presented in Hollywood has started to bring changeI think that Hollywood is becoming more diverse it is just that actors and actresses of different races are not being nominated for awards and getting the credit that they deserve for the roles that they have played in films And I think this is wrong I have seen many great films with lead actors and actresses that are of ethnic backgrounds but award shows like the Oscars and the Golden Globes are not giving them full credit for their performances Social media is now a place where people share their opinions about how award shows went and a main topic is always race People will point out areas where actors were underrepresented Some actors and actresses like Viola Davis and Denzel Washington seem to be nominated almost every year which is great because the academies are broadening their horizons and nominating more AfricanAmerican actors But many performances go unnoticed and are underrated in the eyes the academiesA generational name is a label given to a mass of millions of individuals that outlines the mannerisms of the people based on the general point in history they were born this may mean wars tech or population changes characterize the population More often than not these names are seen as a complete and utter nuisance Millennials are  unfortunately  seen as lazy people who lack the drive to succeed outside of the home This assertion remains untrue for a majority of the millennials Baby Boomers are blamed for many population issues that their gen unwittingly caused Again this name is fitting for the population trends that occurred but has a negative connotation that is related to problems outside the control of the people in the generation In essence these names are given to masses of people for demographics to pick on one another at the dinner table Millennials have assembled their cohort to blame the USs problems on Baby Boomers and vice versa Gen X Y and Z all call each other out on the eversoslight differences that categorize each group Gens are only understood in retrospect but I believe that the current titling of iGen is fitting as this gen saw Apple storm every market worldwide and completely reshape even the most rudimentary functions of interactionWhat will the group after the Millennials be called This question is one that I think is very important not only to me who is part of this generation but to everyone else too Our of name or label will be how the world will not only see us but what weve done as a generation A name needs to capture the essence of what we are who we are and what we have done This generation is changing the world day by day in every aspect In my eyes I see us as The Shift Generation Although it is not as catchy it is meaningful We have shifted so many parts of the world and did it for the best We have taken these social norms that have been around for years and shifted them Turned them upside down This generation is shifting our history from going down one road and going in a completely opposite direction The Shift GenerationOur generation is filled with individuals who are openminded and strongly believe in equality for all As our generation flourishes we will further realize the importance in becoming self motivated individuals and will thrive in our multicultural society A name that would reflect our diverse society would be the Dynamical GenerationI think the best term would be the Programmers Not only does it allude to our exposure to technology and the internet from a young age it also symbolizes how we are the foundations of times to come Thus we are programming the futureThe best term IMO would be Generation Activism We are passionate We actively seek easy solutions and desire to improve lives We do not care if someone is gay or abnormal We just agree that people are people  and that people deserve to be treated as such We want to protect our values without falling victim to trashy corporate schemesI think Gen Z will sufficeI heard that we should be called Generation Z Actually to me this name brings on a feeling that we are the last generation to survive and the world will be brought down by us I actually think we could be called the Technology GenerationA name that I have heard circulating around the internet is Selfie Generation I think that this is an appropriate name for this generation because social media is indisputably a huge part of the modern world Everywhere we go we are bound to see people with their heads down staring at their phones Older generations often make fun of modern teenagers for staying inside all day using their phones instead of frolicking outside like in the good ol days Their criticisms are valid this is the generation that spends the most time with technology simply because we have access to various types of social media that didnt even exist before Selfie generation doesnt necessarily have to represent the pictures that people post of themselves on social media it can just represent the huge impact of social media on modern society It is almost impossible to avoid social media because even schools and employers are utilizing it for professional purposes Hence I think that this name is suitableDue to the fact that each name recommended can somehow fit our generation and that we cant be fit into a single category I think that the Nameless Generation would fit the best There is no name to describe us and fit each aspect of our diverse and unique generationI recently lost one of my grandparents a little over a month ago It was sudden and was somewhat of a harsh shock when I was told but there was also a slight sense of relief like mentioned in the article My grandmother had been in pain for a long time being told time and time again that she wouldnt live much longer and how the pain her lungs caused her seemed to be getting worse and worse Grief especially when it pertains to someone in your family does not have a negative stigma around it However it is something that everyone must encounter eventually Expressing your feelings is probably one of the best ways to grieve no matter in what format The article talks about great ways of doing this Writing talking to someone or even just expressing those feelings aloud to no one are ways to help you get through the grieving process However being someone who has a friend who is in mourning the best thing to do is to give them space Dont rush them and try to hurry the process along That can and will cause a negative reaction Whenever I have been grieving my friends did just this and I came out of it okayAs stated in the article grief causes many common pitfalls and misunderstandings It is quite hard for me to cope with grief I am the type of person to hold in all of my emotions rather than expressing it I do not like to talk about my feelings of sadness when it comes to grief It takes time to fully heal from grief and the process cannot be rushed Many emotions come with grief such as anger and anxiety  those feelings are all common When I am in the state of constant sadness I allow myself to be sad rather than to hide my emotions behind a mask The best way someone could comfort me is to lend me their shoulder to cry on No words are required or necessary the thought of them being there is very comfortingSadly I have experienced the death of a loved one in my life This person I knew and loved ever since I was born and I had a really strong connection with him I was really sad when he had passed away and I really did miss himLike many say grief takes time and I do agree but time itself will not fix the grief The way I handled the death of a loved one is by staying close to my religion With my religion I understand that I would be able to see this loved one again This gave me hope when dealing with the death of my loved one During that time I surrounded myself with my family and we were able to give each other comfort by providing each other company It has now been six years since the death and I am doing just fine Life does have some sad times but also its happy times Of course I am still going to miss this loved one but I always strive to think of the good times instead of the bad in order to move onIn my opinion the best way to handle someone that is grieving is to always be there for them during that moment of time and to let them know that By doing this it reminds that person that someone is there for them and loves them This gives them hope to get through the sad timesThere are many ways to cope with grief Some usually try to forget and move on while others sit alone away from everyone because they feel like they have no one who will understand What I find interesting about the subject of grief is that everyone experiences it from time to time but we feel as nobody could ever understand us Its a personal psychological process that we must conquer in order to obtain the feeling of happiness again The only problem is how do we accomplish this battle Many go to counseling to talk about their problems Some resort to addiction such as alcohol or drugs which leads to even more pain for themselves and the loved ones who care for their mental and physical health Everyone is different which is why I firmly believe there is no correct way to cope with grief There is no deadline for when all the pain will stop It takes our own mind to overcome the challenges and to test our limits to what we can withstandIn my life so far I have been lucky enough to avoid the grief of losing someone who I was very close with However I am often the friend in the situation who becomes the shoulder to cry on That being said I still often times make mistakes and say the wrong things in certain situations Over the past few years I have learned that it is better to insist that someone is going to be okay rather then asking them if they are If a person would like to discuss their life they will on their own However your job isnt to know what the problem is it is to simply comfort them until they are ready to accept the issue andor move on Ive also found that comparing your issues to theirs when they are sad is a useless tactic and considerably rude A person in pain doesnt want to hear about that time you went through almost the exact same thing five years ago or how they have it easy compared to what you had to go through in the past Letting them know they arent alone is a good route to go but what I have just described is not the way to do it Overall listen to your grieving friends andor family If they dont want to talk about their problems dont make them Often times talking isnt necessary Comforting body language could be all that is needed to make a person feel safe and protectedAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported', 'bycurrent', 'events',

pardoned by Mr Trump would receive immunity from being charged with a federal crime over his or her past conduct covered by the pardon That could contract the scope of the special counsel investigation being led by Robert S Mueller III into possible ties between associates of Mr Trump and Russias meddling in the presidential electionSome legal specialists think so While pardons are widely understood to be irrevocable even if obtained through questionable means some experts think that a president who abuses his pardon power might be subject to prosecutionThis is not clear The only limitation explicitly stated in the Constitution is a ban on using a pardon to stop an impeachment proceeding in Congress and the only obvious implicit limitation is that he cannot pardon offenses under state lawBut some legal scholars think a president cannot pardon himself either because it would be a conflict of interestBut she did not explain what transformed that principle into an unwritten legal limit on the power the Constitution bestows on presidentsThere is no definitive answer because no president has ever tried to pardon himself and then been prosecuted which would give courts a chance to weigh in If Mr Trump did purport to pardon himself and was later indicted anyway it could create an opportunity for the Supreme Court to resolve the questionIn her 1974 memo Ms Lawton argued that it would be lawful for a president to declare himself temporarily disabled receive a pardon from the vice president and then resume his role as presidentUnder such a scenario Mr

45,AdvertisementSupported byFixesThe election of Donald J Trump has highlighted religious tensions in America particularly with Trumps proposals to bar Muslims from entering the country and to create a registry of Muslims living in the United States But these tensions did not begin with Trump In America virtually every form of faith or belief has at some point suffered unfavorable reception by others the victims include Roman Catholics Mormons evangelical Christians Jews and atheists alongside MuslimsDemocracy is not just a place where you elect representatives its a society where you can make personal convictions public And diversity isnt just the things we like It isnt just samosas and egg rolls Diversity is also the things you dont like We have to recognize that expressions of some identities will injure othersThe typical metaphor for this is bridges But bridges dont fall from the sky or rise from the ground The ability to disagree with people on some fundamental things and work with them on others isnt natural for the human psyche or civil society Leaders have to create that and we have to be strategic about creating those leadersIn my book I tell a story about Ruth Messinger who ran the American Jewish World Service and was Manhattan borough president In the 1960s Ruth was assigned to build a foster care network in western Oklahoma While taking her baby for walks she saw signs on houses saying Church of Jesus Christ So she knocked on the doors introducing herself and got invited to attend evangelical church servicesSome of the things said during the services were insulting to her Sometimes a sermon mentioned Jews as Christ killers Many of the people didnt think women should be working outside the home and they were pro the Vietnam War which Ruth strongly opposed But Ruth talked about the kids who needed help and afterward when the pastor stood up and asked Who will partner with Ruth Messinger to help these kids in need half the church would stand up and sign their names And Ruth said that if she had let what they said about feminism and the Vietnam War prevent her from forming that partnership hundreds of kids in western Oklahoma would not have had caring foster homesThats an example of somebody who had the ability to disagree on some ultimate concerns and work on others Because of the relationships and trust she built she was later able to have civil conversations about other disagreements including their views of JewsWhen groups have deep differences  say Reform Jews and evangelical Christians on the question of abortion  people say if you dont address the conflict you are ignoring the elephant in the room My response is If all you do is pay attention to the elephant in the room you miss the other animals in the zoo There are other things that Reform Jews and evangelicals can engage on together that are fundamental and inspiring working against sexual trafficking is an excellent exampleAn interfaith leader brackets disagreements temporarily By bracket I dont mean you never return to disagreements I just mean dont get hung up on them Dont let them prevent you from doing other fundamental thingsFor me if you support a Muslim registry because your knowledge of Muslims comes from the first minute of the evening news and your Facebook news feed and there is a significant possibility that different conversations and information about Muslims would shift that idea I would absolutely engage constructively with you And I think this describes many AmericansWhat Im very wary of is what I would call an educated bigotry that seeks to manipulateIn 1959 and 1960 vast swaths of America feared that the election of JFK would mean that the flag of the Vatican would fly in Washington DC and the Pope would descend on the White House Arthur Schlesinger the historian famously said that the deepest bias in the American people is antiCatholicismLast year I was one of thousands of people holding a Vatican Flag on the south lawn of the White House as Pope Francis appeared with President Obama Its a stunning shift in history And people have almost no memory of the antiCatholic bigotry from two generations ago A lot of Catholics dont even remember itWhy As the social science tells us when people of different identities mix positively with one another they come to like each other and that is the great genius of American civil society Interfaith leaders pay attention to the prejudices that have disappeared in the past and recognize that those same dynamics can be put into place againOr identify unlikely and powerful partnerships in history A classic civil rights example would be Abraham Joshua Heschel and Martin Luther King Jr It seems straightforward now but 50 years ago it was uncommon for an Orthodox Jew to march alongside a black BaptistAnother one Abdul Ghaffar Khan and Gandhi in the Hind Swaraj Indian Home Rule movement At a time of great MuslimHindu tension in India this Muslim from Afghanistan marched and worked with Gandhi for the freedom of the subcontinentBy the way thats everything that was said about CatholicsMy wife and I are adamant that we are not going to blame all Trump supporters for what some extremists are doing Our kids met some neighbors other 9yearolds who casually said theyre Trump supporters We told our kids Youre still going to be friends with them We didnt support Trump for president but its good that you know people who did And you should still play football and baseball with them  the 9yearold version of fundamental concernsWe talk a lot about being proud of being Muslim and being Indian and of the contributions of our communities to America It was a Muslim from Bengal Fazlur Rahman Khan who created the architectural form of skyscrapersWe buy Muhammad Ali books We talk about Mahatma Gandhi as the chief inspiration for Martin Luther King Jr We are building pride in their identities and they are generally surrounded by people who are affirming of thatI dont know how Id feel if I lived 90 minutes outside Chicago Where we live in the city the Trump world is a minority But the last thing I want to do is retreat more deeply into my urban liberal bubbleWhat are ways in which I can understand who my fellow citizens who voted differently are What qualities do they possess that I would admire And what are fundamental things that we can work on togetherThats work on me to doAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,football,"['advertisementsupported', 'byfixesthe', 'election', 'of', 'donald', 'j', 'trump', 'has',

46,AdvertisementSupported byGUADALUPE Calif  Daniel R Small climbed the sand dunes here as carefully as a tour guide scaling ancient Egyptian ruins Up there he said sidestepping a scrap of wood and motioning to a pile of rubble in the distance was where the temple once stood To the right half of a sphinx is still buried in the sandOn a site visit this month he pointed out some shrapnel scattered across the dunes likely from steel cables used to buttress the temple facade He also spotted some concrete chunks that could have been used he speculated for stairs or risers But now that these pieces have been windwhipped or sandblasted for nearly 100 years they look like tablets from Egypt he said Its so bizarre The longer the set is exposed to the elements the more authentic it seems somehowFilling an entire room at the Hammer Museum with artifacts from Guadalupe Mr Smalls work plays with current notions of the artist as archaeologist Its also one of several projects in the biennial digging into the early history of Hollywood seeking some insight into todays imageobsessed cultureThe curators Aram Moshayedi and Hamza Walker said they did not seek out a Hollywood focus for the show the Hammers third biennial devoted to emerging or underrecognized artists in Los Angeles But Mr Walker said the theme makes sense given the porous nature of the artworks we were thinking about  where music fashion film and poetry all rub shoulders with visual artI liked the idea of a black female body with autonomy moving independently through a public space said Ms SymsShe drew on her own absurd experience at the dentist for her version set in presentday Los Angeles The video begins as Ms Syms playing with her smartphone learns only moments after receiving anesthesia that insurance wont cover wisdomteeth removal  prompting her to get up from the dentists chair and stumble home All reallife events the artist said Ms Syms incorporates a biglaugh snippet from The Fresh Prince of BelAir and even turns a clip from the original silent film into a GIF ripe for endless looping and recyclingIn the Made in LA catalog the Los Angeles criticcurator Sarah LehrerGraiwer writes about the impact of todays hyperaccelerated visual culture on the individual arguing that its more than just too many images too fast  its resulting in a fullbody change All is a play of surfaces All is flow We digitize ourselves we circulate and broadcast she writesMs Honda uses the stuff of escapism to opposite effect  an investigation into our own patterns of attention and perception If anything my work is meant to push you back into your body she said You hear your own breathing your chair squeak someones stomach gurglingShe said the extrawide hardtotakeinatoneglance format also appeals to her Theres something about the impossibility of seeing things whole  and the pleasures of only seeing things in your mindHer films will be projected on scheduled dates at the Billy Wilder Theater inside the Hammer Museum Cases containing film reels are arranged on a pedestal in the galleries as sculptureHis project operates like a museum within a museum and an intricate restaging of an elaborate stage set creating a hall of mirrors where visitors can see old Hollywood reflected in the eyes of todays new artistsAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported',

47,AdvertisementSupported byGeorge Kennedy who played tough guys oafs GIs and a bonanza of cowboys as one of Hollywoods most versatile and durable character actors and who won an Oscar as the best supporting actor of 1967 for his performance in the Paul Newman film Cool Hand Luke died on Sunday in Boise Idaho He was 91His death was confirmed by his grandson Cory SchenkelVicious killers bumbling lawmen saddle tramps bank robbers scowling bullies  anybody youd be foolish to mess with or trust in an emergency  Mr Kennedy portrayed them all in more than 200 films and television productions in an acting career that spanned nearly five decadesNo critic ever spoke of a George Kennedy oeuvre Many of his films were hokey with absurd plots and overthetop acting And with the exception of his Academy Award performance and his work in about a dozen other films he was most often a peripheral player a sidekick of the star or the straight man with setup lines for the comedianBut from the early 1960s on hardly a year went by without a Kennedy picture  often there were four or five a year  and he was memorable as the heavy in Charade 1963 with Audrey Hepburn and Cary Grant as an Army major in The Dirty Dozen 1967 as a regular in the Airport pictures and later as Leslie Nielsens dumbstruck captain in the Naked Gun comediesHe was perhaps best known for his role in Cool Hand Luke Dragline a chaingang prisoner whose brutality and compassion as the gang leader not only revealed Mr Kennedys rarely seen range as an actor but also deftly illuminated the character of his tormented fellow convict played by Mr NewmanMr Kennedy typically helped to make other stars look good and he worked with a pantheon of them Bette Davis James Stewart Burt Lancaster Charlton Heston John Wayne Clint Eastwood and many moreOccasionally Mr Kennedy headlined the cast of a Bmovie like The Human Factor a 1975 vigilantejustice film in which he wiped out terrorists who killed his family He also starred in two television series He was a cop turned priest in Sarge seen on NBC in the early 1970s and a patrolman in The Blue Knight on CBS in 197576But his stock in trade was the supporting role and his rugged but bland looks were right for almost any part He was tall and burly with a bull neck eyes that widened with shock or narrowed to menacing slits a disingenuous smile and big ham hands to grip the gun or slap the girl In the mold of Lee Marvin or Lee Van Cleef he was a firstrate thug and his deadpan look was perfect for disaster pictures or comediesIn 1970 he played the improbable rescuer Joe Patroni in Airport a soapy melodrama with an allstar cast about a bomber on a plane an airport socked in by a blizzard and desperation aloft and on the ground He reprised his role in the sequels Airport 75 Airport 77 and The Concorde  Airport 79 He was the only cast member to appear in all fourIn the cult favorite The Naked Gun From the Files of Police Squad 1988 and its sequels Naked Gun 2  The Smell of Fear 1991 and Naked Gun 3313 The Final Insult 1994 Mr Kennedy played Capt Ed Hocken wincing and grimacing at the wreckage wrought by Mr Nielsens bumbling Lt Frank DrebinIn 1991 Mr Kennedy was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Ever since I was a little boy he said my primary heroes were movie starsGeorge Harris Kennedy Jr was born in New York City on Feb 18 1925 the son of George and Helen Kennedy His father a musician and bandleader died when he was 4 and he was raised by his mother a ballet dancer His parents put him on the stage at 2 and he later worked in radio But his entertainment career got off to a late startA military career seemed more likely After graduating from Chaminade High School in Mineola NY he joined the Army fought in the infantry in Europe in World War II and spent 16 years in the serviceHe opened the Armys first office of technical assistance for films and television and in the late 1950s retired and became an adviser to The Phil Silvers Show Soon he was speaking lines on that program and by the early 1960s he was playing roles on shows like Maverick Peter Gunn and Route 66 From 1988 to 1991 he was on the primetime CBS soap opera Dallas playing Carter McKay a rival of the Ewing brothersHe made occasional appearances in films and television shows in recent years In 2014 he was in the film The Gambler starring Mark Wahlberg and Jessica Lange He published a memoir Trust Me in 2011His first marriage to Revel Wurman in 1959 ended in divorce in 1978 He married Joan McCarthy in 1978 She died in 2014In addition to his grandson Mr

49,AdvertisementSupported byHONG KONG  The Chinese government has adopted new regulations requiring companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over secret source code submit to invasive audits and build socalled back doors into hardware and software according to a copy of the rules obtained by foreign technology companies that do billions of dollars worth of business in ChinaThe new rules laid out in a 22page document approved at the end of last year are the first in a series of policies expected to be unveiled in the coming months that Beijing says are intended to strengthen cybersecurity in critical Chinese industries As copies have spread in the past month the regulations have heightened concern among foreign companies that the authorities are trying to force them out of one of the largest and fastestgrowing marketsIn a letter sent Wednesday to a toplevel Communist Party committee on cybersecurity led by President Xi Jinping foreign business groups objected to the new policies and complained that they amounted to protectionismThe groups which include the US Chamber of Commerce called for urgent discussion and dialogue about what they said was a growing trend toward policies that cite cybersecurity in requiring companies to use only technology products and services that are developed and controlled by Chinese companiesAlthough it is unclear to what extent the new rules result from security concerns and to what extent they are cover for building up the Chinese tech industry the Chinese regulations go far beyond measures taken by most other countries lending some credibility to industry claims that they are protectionist Beijing also has long used the Internet to keep tabs on its citizens and ensure the Communist Partys hold on powerChinese companies must also follow the new regulations though they will find it easier since for most their core customers are in ChinaChinas Internet filters have increasingly created a world with two Internets a Chinese one and a global one The new policies could further split the tech world forcing hardware and software makers to sell either to China or the United States or to create significantly different products for the two countriesWhile the Obama administration will almost certainly complain that the new rules are protectionist in nature the Chinese will be able to make a case that they differ only in degree from Washingtons own requirementsThe United States has made it virtually impossible for Huawei a major Chinese maker of computer servers and cellphones to sell its products in the United States arguing that its equipment could have back doors for the Chinese governmentThe documents released by Edward J Snowden the former National Security Agency contractor revealed a major effort by the agency to enter Huaweis systems both to figure out who controls the company and to create back doors that the United States could exploitRecent calls by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James B Comey to assure that the United States has a key to decrypt information stored on iPhones and other devices will doubtless be used by the Chinese to argue that all governments need access to sensitive computer systemsAnalysts said new Chinese policies like the bank rules and an antiterrorism law that is still in draft form would make doing business increasingly difficult in China for foreign hardware and software companiesI think theyre obviously targeting foreign vendors that are operating in China said Matthew Cheung a researcher at the analytics firm Gartner They are promoting the local technologies so that local providers who have the capabilities to provide systems to these enterprises can get more market shareFor instance the bank rules say 75 percent of technology products used by Chinese institutions must be classified as secure and controllable by 2019Though analysts say secure and controllable  a phrase that peppers several new Chinese technology policies  may be open to interpretation a chart attached to the banking regulations shows the troubles foreign companies could have in winning that classification for their productsFor most computing and networking equipment the chart says source code must be turned over to Chinese officials But many foreign companies would be unwilling to disclose code because of concerns about intellectual property security and in some cases United States export lawThe chart also calls for companies that want to sell to banks to set up research and development centers in China obtain permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build ports to allow Chinese officials to manage and monitor data processed by their hardwareThe draft antiterrorism law pushes even further calling for companies to store all data related to Chinese users on servers in China create methods for monitoring content for terror threats and provide keys to encryption to public security authoritiesBanking is the first industry where we are aware a blackandwhite regulatory document was issued said Jeffrey Yao a vice president for enterprise research at IDC In some other industries if you talk to the customers many of them get the pressure to adopt the local brands but in most of the cases they are via internal communications from the top officersSome of Americas largest tech companies could be hurt by the rules including Apple which is making a big push into the country Apple has used new encryption methods in the iPhone 6 that are based on a complicated mathematical algorithm tied to a code unique to each phone Apple says it has no access to the codes but under the proposed antiterrorism law it would be required to provide a key so that the Chinese government could decrypt data stored on iPhonesA growing number of American technology executives have complained about new barriers to access to the Chinese market John T Chambers the chief executive of the network equipment maker Cisco Systems has raised the issue as have executives at the chip maker Qualcomm This week Microsofts chief executive Satya Nadella said his company was working through geopolitical issues regarding ChinaIn the letter the Western companies voiced concerns about a broader cybersecurity review regime under which the Chinese government would assess the security and controllability of hardware software and technology services sold in China through audits and other checks More details about the checks will be sent in February to the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs the committee led by the Chinese president according to a recent report by Xinhua the staterun news agencyThe committee which was created after the disclosures by Mr Snowden is leading the charge in consolidating and streamlining online security efforts in China Analysts said it had most likely presided over or given tacit support to the new policiesThe leadership committee is said to be also trying to wean the country from its reliance on foreign technology a longstanding goal that has gained urgency after Mr Snowdens revelationsZuo Xiaodong vice president of the China Information Security Research Institute said the new policies and the broader push for indigenous innovation were not intended to eliminate foreign companies from the marketWere under the yoke of others If the others stop services what do we do he said noting that many Chinese companies and local governments had to scramble when Microsoft discontinued its support of Windows XP From a security perspective that simply wasnt acceptable Were breaking away from these types of circumstancesEven if Beijing wants it to the banking industry cannot immediately do away with all foreign hardware makers Mr Yao of IDC said Banks purchase billions of dollars worth of hardware and software to manage transactions and Chinese companies cannot yet produce some of the higherend servers and mainframes they rely onMr Yao said 90 percent of highend servers and mainframes in China were still produced by multinationals Still Chinese companies are catching up at the lower endFor all enterprise hardware local brands represented 213 percent revenue share in 2010 in PRC market and we expect in 2014 that number will reach 431 percent he said using the abbreviation for the Peoples Republic of China Thats

51,AdvertisementSupported byI am embarrassed to admit how much Ive enjoyed the Donald Trump vicepresidential search Theres nothing like a bunch of egomaniacs humiliating themselves in public to cheer up a dark dayWe got to sit through a series of very public tryouts  who can introduce Trump at a rally in the loudest most craven manner possible My blue ribbon went to Indiana Gov Mike Pence who hollered that Trump has never forgotten or forsaken the people who work with their hands apparently skipping over all the construction workers hes stiffed in his real estate business Pence has also started twittering like a howling dog We will not rest until we elect realDonaldTrump as the next President of the United States of AmericaWho could resist all that The Trump campaign is sending out signals that Pence is the one although you can never tell with the Donald I say lets continue the suspense until the official announcement on Friday Really theres nothing about Definitely Mike Pence that will improve the quality of your life until thenHowever theres no denying hes the frontrunner On Wednesday the entire Trump crew was in Indianapolis where Pence was visited by a delegation that included Trump Trumps daughter Trumps sons Trumps soninlaw and  oh yeah the campaign managerThen Newt Gingrich flew in for a sitdown with the kids apparently followed by Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions The only major vicepresidential prospect who wasnt in Indiana was Chris ChristieBut Trump and Christie were famously close already despite the fact that Christie once sent Ivanka Trumps fatherinlaw to prison Yes indeed When he was US attorney Christie prosecuted Charles Kushner who wound up spending 14 months in the clink for tax evasion witness tampering and illegal campaign donations One of the case highlights involved a family business feud during which Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brotherinlawKushners son Jared  Ivankas husband  is very influential in the Trump campaign and seems to have gotten over the sendDadtotheclink issue completely You can see why everyone has been comparing the vicepresidential search to a reality TV show All we needed was an announcement that the final four would be competing in a challenge that involves eating raw groundhog liversFor those of us who love obscure political factoids it seemed appropriate that this was all going on in Indiana The state has often been at the center of vicepresidential politics Dan Quayle Nearly a dozen Hoosiers have been nominated for the job since the Civil War Dan Quayle Several have won Dan QuayleFormer Indiana Gov Thomas Hendrickss pull in his home state got Grover Cleveland critical electoral votes he needed to become president after the 1884 election It was one of the very few times that the vicepresidential selection made a big differenceSo stop complaining about the terrible tone of the modern mediaOK enough about Indiana I just wanted to share Ive also been rooting for Senator Sessions to show up in the vetting so I could point out that the only person ever elected to a national office from Alabama was William King the only bachelor vice president who was once a very close friend and sometimes roommate with James Buchanan the only bachelor presidentSee how can you not like this stuffBut about the Trump contenders Each of them has a special something Gingrich like Trump has been married three times Sixwife ticket Bringing Newt back would also allow the nation to revisit his interesting plan to replace unionized school janitors with poor childrenChristie has exhibited a marvelous ability to suck up abuse Trump has made fun of him for everything from being AWOL from the governors office to eating Oreos There are pictures of Trump holding a huge umbrella over his own famous head and letting Christie get wet When youve currently got a 26 percent approval rating in your home state I guess you take whatever they throw at you However Christies office denied reports that Trump once sent him out to get hamburgersI have a theory that women will never vote for a male presidential candidate who yells because it reminds them of their worst boyfriends A TrumpChristie ticket would be like the worst boyfriend sitting in the living room with his thuglike pal watching football with their shoes off and demanding that you cook them pizza from scratchA TrumpGingrich ticket would be a total of 143 years oldNone of the options are really all that terrific But then youve got to be in a pretty bad place to begin with if youre yearning for the spot beneath Donald Trump I just hope that if the decision came down to that livereating contest somebody took pictures Itd be a great feature for the Cleveland conventionAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

52,AdvertisementSupported byImportance of PlaceThe results were deeply disappointing Parents who received the vouchers did not seem to earn more in later years than otherwise similar adults and children did not seem to do better in school The programs apparent failure has haunted social scientists and policy makers making poverty seem all the more intractableThe city is especially harsh for boys Lowincome boys who grew up there in recent decades make roughly 25 percent less as adults than similar lowincome boys who were born in the city and moved as small children to an average placeChildren growing up in some places go on to earn more than they would if they had grown up elsewhereThe places where poor children face the worst odds include some  but not all  of the nations largest urban areas like Atlanta Chicago Los Angeles Milwaukee Orlando West Palm Beach and Tampa in Florida Austin Tex the Bronx and the parts of Manhattan with lowincome neighborhoodsAll else equal lowincome boys who grow up in such areas earn about 35 percent less on average than otherwise similar lowincome children who grow up in the best areas for mobility For girls the gap is closer to 25 percentMany of these places have large AfricanAmerican populations and the findings suggest that race plays an enormous but complex role in upward mobility The nations legacy of racial inequality appears to affect all lowincome children who live in heavily black areas Both black and white children seem to have longer odds of reaching the middle class and both seem to benefit from moving to better neighborhoodsThe places most conducive to upward mobility include large cities  San Francisco San Diego Salt Lake City Las Vegas and Providence RI  and major suburban counties such as Fairfax Va Bergen NJ Bucks Pa Macomb Mich Worcester Mass and Contra Costa CalifThese places tend to share several traits Mr Hendren said They have elementary schools with higher test scores a higher share of twoparent families greater levels of involvement in civic and religious groups and more residential integration of affluent middleclass and poor familiesFor lowincome families a home in places with these characteristics is often a financial stretch Rachelle Hawkins a 32yearold single mother in California rented an apartment in Contra Costa late last year with help from a Contra Costa nonprofit called Shelter Inc which paid her first months rent She moved from a gritty neighborhood near Oakland and was homeless for a time She makes about 29000 as a customerservice agent in online banking and faces an annual rent bill of almost 17000But she thinks the burden is worth it for her children who are 4 and 6 I dont think my kids are going to remember what we went through Ms Hawkins said They are absolutely better off just because of the environmentIn both studies the younger children were when they moved the better they did Children were less likely to become single parents when they grew up were more likely to go to college and to earn more The original research had not been able to follow the economic outcomes of younger children because not enough time had passed Mr Katz saidStill the more extensive nationwide data on moving found that older children were also affected by their neighborhood The effect was what statisticians call linear Each additional year in a different place had roughly the same average effect on a childs adult earnings A teenagers year in a better neighborhood mattered as much as a 9yearolds year  but 9year olds still had their teenage years in front of themSome economists who have seen the new study say that it argues for a new approach to housing policy Current policy often forces the parents of young children onto waiting lists for housing vouchers It also gives tax incentives to developers who build in poor neighborhoods rather than rewarding those who build affordable housing in areas that seem to offer better environmentsIn an interview Friday Julin Castro the secretary of Housing and Urban Development said he was excited by the new data Mr Castro said his department had been planning to reallocate funding so that some people moving to more expensive neighborhoods would receive larger vouchers Currently the value of vouchers tends to be constant across a metropolitan areaThe large county on the other end of the spectrum from Baltimore with the best odds of escaping poverty is DuPage County Ill west of Chicago It contains suburbs where the schools are considered better and where housing costs more than in Chicago and some closein suburbsBriana her daughter was hesitant about leaving her friends but Mrs Polk insisted saying they could still visit them I knew absolutely it would mean better possibilities for my kids she saidMrs Polk earns about 40000 a year at a company that helps clear goods through customs She has been able to afford the move by living in a cramped 1025amonth onebedroom apartment  and with help from a county program that gives them about 2000 a year toward living expensesHer son Jovan graduated from high school last year and is now working while Briana will graduate this spring Both plan to enroll in community college in the next yearAlthough most places with better odds of escaping poverty have higher rent the researchers did identify some counties as upwardmobility bargains These include Putnam County NY parts of the Pittsburgh and Altoona areas in Pennsylvania and if only relative to surrounding areas Contra CostaThe study defined low income as the 25th percentile of the income distribution  a household earning less than threequarters of other households nationally or about 30000 a year for families with children But the analysis covered the full income distribution and the geographic patterns at the 25th percentile were very similar to those for poorer and somewhat less poor householdsThe data suggests otherwise The easiest way to understand the pattern may be the different effects on siblings who have so much in common Younger siblings who moved from a bad area to a better one earned more as adults than their older siblings who were part of the same move The particular environment of a city really does seem to affect its residentsThe data does not answer the question of whether the factors that distinguish highermobility places like better schools and less economic segregation are causing the differences  or are themselves knockon effects of other underlying causes We still need clarity on that Mr Grusky the Stanford professor saidFrom her perspective Ms Hawkins the Contra Costa resident said that the mixing of people from different social classes did make a differenceIts all spread out here she said In her old home in San Leandro Calif entire neighborhoods had high unemployment and crime which led some people who did have jobs to flee causing a downward spiral You dont want to put your kid in harms way Thats just extra stressFor all the benefits that moves can bring they are not a solution to poverty said people who have seen the new paper as well as the researchers themselves Finding ways to improve those neighborhoods for people who cannot or do not want to move is also important researchers and policy makers saidWe cant walk away from them Mr Castro the housing secretary said We need a twopronged approachFor more on this subjectDavid Leonhardt reported from Washington Amanda Cox from New York and Claire Cain Miller from San Francisco Dave McKinney contributed reporting from Wood Dale

53,AdvertisementSupported byInboxRallying Around The AstrodomeTo the Sports EditorRe Game Over for the Astrodome Stadium of the Future  March 8 Houston we have a problem Michael Beschlosss column rightly captures the significance and innovation of the Astrodome in its early years but it calls the end to the stadiums future prematurely While the roar of the Astrodomes crowd is gone today Houstonians passion for the citys iconic landmark remains and the national effort to revitalize and reuse the stadium continues to gain momentumThis month an Urban Land Institute Advisory Services Panel report will offer recommendations on how Houston can reimagine the Astrodome as a civic space that will celebrate and honor both the cultural heritage of the Dome and the citys cando spirit When this panel  which includes experts in architecture land use and real estate development  met in Houston in December to explore the feasibility of reusing and redeveloping the Astrodome it enthusiastically supported saving the historic venue Tearing down the Astrodome would rob Houston of one of its most beloved landmarks and a structure that if given the opportunity still has a bright futureLets not give up on this iconic structure and miss a historic comebackSTEPHANIE K MEEKS WashingtonThe writer is president and chief executive officer of the National Trust for Historic PreservationThe Exploitative Side of FootballTo the Sports EditorRe Struggling in the Streets Amid Former College Players Decline Questions About Role Football Played March 8 Ryan Hoffman is the poster child for all the young men who continue to be exploited by college football While the toptier universities and their coaches make many millions men like Hoffman are chewed up and spit out essentially used as cannon fodder to generate massive TV audiences alumni donations and institutional recognition This sad state of affairs is especially true for a vast majority of players who do not go on to the NFL and receive no ongoing insurance benefits or support for injuries sustained while playing for the old alma mater I would encourage you to continue to chronicle and quantify the extent of this gross injustice until the institutions that reap so many benefits  universities TV networks sponsors etc  step up and do the right thingWALTER B ROSE San Anselmo CalifLets Get Back in the GameTo the Sports EditorRe Your Move Grandmaster To the US Please March 11 That the United States is trying to entice Italys top chess player with a large sum of money to cross the sea and play for us in the World Team Chess Championship had me wondering does this speak to a larger problem With a population of only 143 million Russia can fill long rosters with worldclass chess players We have 318 million people yet we are struggling to find five internationally competitive players This is a barometer for intellectualism we have fallen behind while Russia has put us in check I applaud efforts to keep chess alive in the United States Lets reclaim the intellectual curiosity prowess and tenacity on which this country was founded Could we perhaps start with a game of chessALETHEIA DONAHUE

55,AdvertisementSupported byIt also shined a bright light on something more commonplace the FBIs practice of keeping careful contemporaneous notesFor law enforcement officials like Mr Comey who was fired last week as the director of the FBI documenting sensitive conversations is a reflex  and in keeping with the habits of diligent lawyers Mr Comey was a federal prosecutor and corporate counsel before he took over the FBIIn sensitive investigations as well as in routine matters it is standard for people who work in law enforcement to keep detailed phone and meeting logs Lauren C Anderson a former top FBI official saidThats the culture of the FBI  you habitually document everything you do Ms Anderson a 29year veteran of the bureau said As a rule youre not taping every conversation so your ability to recall details in a way that can be maintained and relied on is absolutely criticalThe instinct to preserve possible evidence goes beyond the FBIThe same is true in the CIA Ms Anderson said Theyre meticulous in their documentation of both formal and informal communicationsMemos such as Mr Comeys help reflect a level of detail documented while events are still fresh in the writers mind In court they can serve to corroborate testimonyInteractions with people who may in some way figure into an investigation  regardless of what may be discussed  could be pertinent to an inquiry and later serve as evidenceMemos give you the flexibility to report facts as well as atmospheric impressions Ms Anderson saidIt goes to his credibility she said of Mr Comey The fact that he wrote it when it happened lends weight to it Its not like he wrote something last weekend and backdated itMr Comeys memos were not the standard forms that FBI agents use to summarize the facts of interviews they conduct called FD302s or 302s in bureau parlance They were a more informal way to document not just the facts of an interaction but also personal impressions and analysis to help put those facts into contextIn 2007 the typewritten notes of Robert S Mueller III the FBI director at that time helped resolve a dispute over the Bush administrations warrantless surveillance programMr Comey as it happens was also involved He testified in 2007 before a congressional committee about a series of meetings and phone conversations about the surveillance program he had in 2004 when he was deputy attorney generalDemocrats have used Mr Comeys memo to push again for an independent panel to investigate ties between Mr Trumps associates and Russia and some even pressed for the impeachment of Mr Trump though many expressed caution on calling for such a drastic stepMany legal questions need to be answered first said Representative Adam B Schiff of California the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee including establishing Mr Trumps intent if he did ask Mr Comey to end the inquiry into Mr Flynn which the White House deniesIt cannot serve as a method to nullify the election by other means Mr Schiff said of possible impeachment proceedingsRepresentative Justin Amash a Michigan Republican with a history of speaking out against his party said that if Mr Comeys account was accurate he believed it to be grounds for impeachmentThe Senate Intelligence Committee and House Oversight Committee separately requested documents related to Mr Comeys interactions with the president leaders of both committees also said they were poised to issue subpoenas to obtain Mr Comeys memo if necessary The Senate committee also invited Mr Comey to testify openly and behind closed doorsThe White House has expressed skepticism of Mr Comeys characterization of his interactions with Mr Trump insisting that the president never asked that the Flynn investigation be shut downThe president is confident in the events that he has maintained and he wants the truth in these investigations to get to the bottom of the situation Sean Spicer the White House press secretary said Wednesday There are

in the interview So you never know whats out there But I didnt tape and I dont have any tape and I didnt tapeWhen the Fox interviewer suggested that the possible existence of recordings might have made sure Mr Comey stayed honest in those hearings Mr Trump paused before responding Well it wasnt very stupid I can tell you that He also said that once Mr Comey faced the possibility that tapes of their conversations existed I think his story may have changedBy Friday evening Mr Trump had shifted his frustration in the election inquiry  upon which his critics have seized and which he sees as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency  toward the Obama administrationHes very very good friends with Comey which is very bothersome Mr Trump saidMr Trump said theres been no collusion no obstruction  and virtually everybody agrees to that and he added that some of Mr Muellers legal team had supported Mrs ClintonThe president closed on a more positive note saying Robert Muellers an honorable man and hopefully hell come up with an honorable solutionAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'byive', 'been', 'reading', 'about', 'it', 'for', 'the',

59,AdvertisementSupported byMOSCOW  Seeking to calm growing fears of an economic meltdown the Russian government on Wednesday introduced a package of measures to reduce pressures on banks and urged the public to stay calmIt seemed to work at least temporarily By Wednesday evening amid indications of a government intervention in the currency markets the ruble had recovered more than 11 percent of the previous days lossesPrime Minister Dmitri A Medvedev met with the leaders of Russian business energy exporters like Rosneft and Gazprom and others pledging government support for business and the rubleAnd President Vladimir V Putin is on deck scheduled to hold a nationally televised news conference on Thursday in which he is expected to address the recent financial turmoilThe Central Bank and the government have worked out a package of measures to stabilize the situation Mr Medvedev said according to a government transcript We will act in a coordinated way here What we are seeing today is mostly playing on emotionsIt was a notable turnaround from the previous evening when Russians with rubles in hand fanned out to foreign currency exchanges and electronics stores looking to beat looming price increasesOpponents of Mr Putin lined up to declare that his title as a guarantor of economic stability had been proved falseThe Russian authorities are finally beginning to join up the dots and think collectively to try and reassure markets said Timothy Ash head of emergingmarket research at Standard Bank in an investors note on Wednesday afternoonPublic opinion in support of measures had reached a fever pitch as the ruble plummeted to 80 to the dollar on TuesdayThis is a very dangerous situation we are separated from a fully fledged run on the banks by just a few days Vedomosti the countrys leading business broadsheet wrote in an editorial on Wednesday morning If the currency market is not reassured right now the banking system will require large external supportThe economic turmoil has nurtured a dark humor Ivan Urgant a 36yearold comedian akin to Jimmy Fallon spoofed recent advertisements for the Google mobile operating system on his latenight show with a skit called OK RubleBetter not to go anywhere the robotic voice in his telephone responds when he asks where to ring in the New Year When he asks what the exchange rate for the ruble will be tomorrow the phone suggests watching a video of kittens playingThere were other signs that the government was making entreaties to Russias business community On Wednesday evening Russian prosecutors unexpectedly freed Vladimir P Yevtushenkov the oligarch owner of the Sistema conglomerate from house arrest during an investigation of what critics dismiss as trumpedup charges of embezzlement The accusations and seizure of Bashneft an oil producer that he acquired in 2009 had been seen as a significant blow to property rights in RussiaHe was not freed however before Bashneft was nationalizedThe announcement drew parallels to Mr Putins unexpected pardoning a year ago of Mikhail B Khodorkovsky the jailed Russian oligarch considered the countrys most famous political prisoner at his annual news conferenceWith Mr Putin set to speak tomorrow his spokesman Dmitri S Peskov said on national television Wednesday that there was cause for some optimism for the Russian economyIn 2008 if you remember Putin came out and said It is a crisis I am assuming responsibility everything will turn out right  Mr Peskov said Did it turn out right It did Lets hope for the best this time

61,AdvertisementSupported byMr Caro is working on the fifth and final volume which focuses on Johnsons presidency including the disaster of the Vietnam War But now hes taken some time out for a somewhat unexpected role inspiration for a 10week citywide cultural festival organized by Carnegie HallCarnegie Hall has its own rich 60s history including debuts by Sviatoslav Richter 1960 Lenny Bruce 1961 Bob Dylan 1961 the Beatles who played there twice in one day in 1964 Leontyne Price 1965 and Joni Mitchell 1969 Dr King gave what would be his last public speech there on Feb 23 1968 during a centennial celebration for WEB Du Bois Several weeks later the civil rights activist Robert Moses stepped onstage before a performance by Duke Ellington and His Orchestra to announce that Dr King had been shotPeople talk a lot about the 60s Mr Caro said but they dont really realize what they areThis week he talked about the festival the decade and the homestretch of his biography Here are edited excerpts from the conversationYouve spent decades minutely chronicling American politics How did you get involved with a festival viewing the decade through the lens of art and cultureClive Gillinson Carnegie Halls executive and artistic director and I have lunch and generally wind up talking about politics and government One day about two years ago he said to me Do you have an idea for a festival Go home and think about it I said I dont have to think about it The 60sWhen you read the paper every night so much of what is under assault right now  womens rights gay rights voting rights Medicare and Medicaid a more open immigration policy  got started or reached a new intensity in the 1960s In my book Im writing about Johnson passing all these bills while on the front pages every day they are trying to dismantle these bills This is an era where there is so much thought that government is bad Im writing about a time when people thought government was a force for goodThis is the first time Carnegie Hall has turned to a figure outside of the musical world to help plan one of its festivals What are some of the artistic moments from the 60s that have stuck with youTo me its the protest music Ive written about what to me is the supreme moment showing the power of music to create social change which was when Johnson took the title of the most important anthem in his 1965 televised address to Congress a week after the Selma march when he called for passage of a voting rights act Its not just Negroes he said but really its all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice And we shall overcome The president of the United States takes the key line of the anthem and uses it to help push the bill through Thats the power of musicWe associate the 60s with the counterculture and protests against government But that was also when the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities so often under attack in recent years were establishedJohnson was the moving force behind both of those agencies Obama knows my books and when he put the National Humanities Medal around my neck in 2010 I thought There are two people in this room who know how this got startedIm going to ask you to give me a pass on that I havent written that chapter yetAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported',

62,AdvertisementSupported byMr Comey depicts Mr Trump as a man engrossed to the point of distraction with political rivalries and fears that bureaucrats and government officials including in the FBI were trying to undermine his legitimacyHere are six takeawaysMr Trump denied the episode had taken place and appeared to Mr Comey to be defending himself Mr Comey replied that the allegations could have been made up but that the job of the FBI was to protect the president from efforts to coerce himThough Mr Trump ended the meeting genially the accusations clearly stuck with him Mr Comeys memos showed At least twice more in the ensuing weeks Mr Trump laid out a timeline for Mr Comey and claimed that it showed that such a tape could not existAccording to the memos the president told Mr Comey in a oneonone dinner at the White House later in January 2017 that he had spoken with several people who had been on the trip with him Mr Trump said those people reminded him that he did not stay overnight in MoscowMr Trump said that he had arrived in the morning attended a series of events then went to a hotel to shower and dress for the pageant leaving Russia afterwardIn a February 2017 meeting in the Oval Office Mr Trump told Mr Comey the hookers thing is nonsense but that President Vladimir V Putin of Russia had told him that the country had some of the most beautiful hookers in the worldMr Comeys decision to brief Mr Trump on the dossier was based at least in part on the fact that American intelligence agencies had corroborated parts of the dossier according to the memosI explained that the analysts from all three agencies agreed it was relevant and that portions of the material were corroborated by other intelligence Mr Comey wrote in a memo in February 2017 describing how he responded to a question from Mr Priebus about why he told the presidentelect a month earlier about the dossierParts of the memo are redacted but appear to say that information in the dossier was consistent with and corroborated by other intelligence and that the incoming president needed to know the rest of it was out thereMr Trump also raised on several occasions Mr Comeys deputy at the FBI Andrew G McCabe according to the memos Mr McCabe had been the subject of rightwing attacks over his involvement in the investigation into Hillary Clintons handling of classified information while secretary of state His wife Jill received hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations for her failed Virginia State Senate campaign from a political committee run by a longtime Clinton allySome conservatives insisted that Mr McCabe should have recused himself from the Clinton investigation to avoid bias and Mr Trump joined in those attacks on the campaign trailAccording to the memos Mr Trump asked Mr Comey during their January dinner whether Mr McCabe had a problem with the presidentI was pretty rough on him and his wife during the campaign Mr Trump ventured Mr Comey tried to smooth over the issue by explaining that FBI agents and officials pride themselves on being apoliticall explained that Andy was a true professional and had no problem at all Mr Comey wrote I then explained what FBI people were like that whatever their personal views they strip them when they step into their bureau roles and actually hold political people in slight contempt without regard to partyThe president broached the subject again during dinner and the FBI director repeated his responseI again affirmed Andys ability and professionalism and said the president would come to see and benefit from both Mr Comey wroteIn an Oval Office meeting weeks later Mr Trump brought up Mr McCabe againHe asked as he had at our dinner whether my deputy had a problem with him and recounting how hard he had been on the campaign trail saying The No 2 guy at the FBI took a million dollars from the ClintonsMr Comey said he again explained that Mr McCabe was a pro and had never mentioned Mr Trumps attacksAt their dinner Mr Trump gave contradictory explanations about whether Mr Priebus knew they were meetingEarly on as they discussed whom Mr Comeys point of contact should be at the White House Mr Trump said that Reince doesnt know we are having dinner but that Mr Comey should plan to go to himBut as Mr Comey was preparing to leave the White House that night Mr Trump told him Reince knows we are having dinner the opposite of what he said earlier according to one memoMr Comey neither explained nor speculated why Mr Trump contradicted himselfIn their own meeting on Feb 8 2017 Mr Priebus tried to ask Mr Comey whether the FBI was wiretapping the national security adviser at the time Michael T FlynnWeeks earlier reports had emerged that Mr Flynn was overheard on a wiretap talking with the Russian ambassador to the United States about sanctions being imposed by the Obama administration as punishment for its election interference The calls raised concerns among senior law enforcement and intelligence agencies that Mr Flynn might have been working to help the RussiansMr Comeys answer was redacted in the released version of the memos But it is widely believed that Mr Flynn was overheard on the wiretap because American intelligence agencies routinely listen in on the calls of foreign ambassadorsMr Comey said he then explained how such questions should be routed from the White House counsels office to the Justice DepartmentI explained that it was important that communications about any particular case go through that channel to protect us and to protect the WH from any accusations of improper influence Mr Comey said using shorthand for the White HouseIn one February conversation the two men discussed leaks in the news media at length By then Mr Trump had endured several embarrassing disclosures of classified information including transcripts of his calls with foreign leaders in which he was short with the leaders of American allies including Australia and MexicoIn his memo Mr Comey explained how he hoped to catch one of the leakers to set an exampleI said I was eager to find leakers and would like to nail one to the door as a message Mr Comey said I said something about it being difficult and he replied that we need to go after the reporters and referred to the fact that 10 or 15 years ago we put them in jail to find what they know and it workedMr Trump then mentioned Judith Miller a former reporter for The New York Times In 2005 Ms Miller was jailed for 85 days for refusing to testify and reveal her confidential source about the identity of a former CIA operative Valerie Plame before relentingI explained that I was a fan of pursuing leaks aggressively but that going after reporters was tricky for legal reasons and because DOJ tends to approach it conservatively Mr Comey said The president he said suggested he speak to Attorney General Jeff Sessions about being more aggressive in prosecuting leaksEileen Sullivan contributed

team last week  described it as a productive effort to reopen negotiations over a possible interview that the special counsel Robert S Mueller III is seeking with the presidentAt this stage of an investigation itd be highly unusual to let an ordinary client testify Mr Giuliani said However he added This isnt an ordinary client This is the president of the United StatesHe said that they were trying to assess whether Mr Mueller and his staff are truly objective particularly in terms of Mr Comey Obviously if theyve already made up their minds wed be stupid to do thatMr Trumps legal team is not united on precisely how to deal with Mr Muellers office going forward But a person familiar with the discussions said that they expected to visit with Mr Muellers team in the next few days as they try to find a path forwardMr Giulianis longtime law partner Marc L Mukasey is likely to join the team after a success this week in a trial in Connecticut two people close to the team saidMr Trump has expressed different views at different times about whether he wants to sit for an interview with Mr Mueller But some people on the presidents team believe that the only way to wind down the special counsel investigation is to negotiate an interview or something in its place that would satisfy the questions Mr Mueller hasMr Trump has denounced that investigation and he has maintained that there was no collusion between his campaign and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election But Mr Giuliani is a wellknown name who was willing to take on Mr Trumps case and he has a personal relationship with Mr Mueller from his own days working for the Justice DepartmentSome of Mr Trumps lawyers believe that the existing law does not allow for the prosecution of a sitting president meaning that Mr Mueller is most likely to simply issue a report to Congress regardless of whether Mr Trump takes part in an interviewMichael S Schmidt contributed reportingAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

65,AdvertisementSupported byMr Jordan plays a talented lightheavyweight whose rapid ascent in the sport is fueled by an identity crisis Even his name is in question The love child of Apollo Creed Rockys erstwhile nemesis and eventual best friend the young man is unsure whether to embrace or spurn the legacy of a father he never knew He calls himself Adonis or sometimes Donnie Johnson and his background is a complicated tangle of deprivation and privilege He grew up in foster homes and juvenile detention centers before being adopted by Apollos widow Mary Anne Phylicia Rashad who raised him in Los Angeles opulence and kept him away from the boxing ringA look at what Times critics had to say about the original Rocky 1976 and the new Creed the latest entry in the franchiseRocky was the story of a Great White Hope and also a fable for an era of racial backlash Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers was the heavy in that movie and Rocky was the noble underdog Later they set aside their differences and faced a common Soviet enemy as the series turned its attention to Cold War geopolitics By then Apollo was the sidekick and the sacrificial friend an injustice that Creed by its very title seeks to redressThe movie is also a Hollywood rarity a boxing movie with a black hero It is bizarre  though hardly surprising  that a sport dominated for decades by AfricanAmerican and Latino athletes looks more like ice hockey on screen And Creed like Fruitvale Station embeds its drama in the perils and pleasures of black life in America Adonis is a complex character with a complex fate He is at once a rich kid and a street kid the proud carrier of an illustrious heritage and an invisible manHis relationship with Rocky is complicated too The older fighter is a mentor and a father figure to be sure but he also needs someone to take care of him especially when illness adds a melodramatic twist to the plot Rocky has reconciled himself to loss The people he loved  Paulie Mickey Creed and Adrian  are all goneIts too simple to say that Adonis teaches him to care again One of the most surprising things about Creed is how gentle and easygoing it is notwithstanding the effective brutality of the fight scenes It is a pleasure to watch Mr Stallone amble through a movie with nothing much to prove He is at his best when he works comfortably within his limitations as an actor Mr Jordans limitations in contrast have yet to be discovered With every role he seems to delight in the unfolding of his talent and to pass his excitement along to the audienceWhich partly explains the applause that is likely to echo through multiplexes this Thanksgiving Creed is a dandy piece of entertainment soothingly oldfashioned and bracingly uptodate The punches fly the music soars hiphop along with Ludwig Goranssons variations on the old Bill Conti brass and the ground is prepared for Creed II Well see how that goes But for now it is sweet to have this lesson in the importance of fast footwork brute power and brotherly loveCreed is rated PG13 Parents strongly cautioned Literal blood metaphorical guts and discreet sex Running time 2 hours 13 minutesMovie data powered by

66,AdvertisementSupported byMr McCabe is a 21year FBI veteran who joined the bureau out of law school and rose to its No 2 position in 2016 The deputy director is essentially the FBIs chief operating officerHe oversaw two of the most politically charged cases in FBI history the investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email server and the investigation of Donald J Trumps campaign ties to the Russian governmentMr McCabe was questioned as part of a wideranging internal inquiry into the FBIs handling of the Clinton investigation and other matters During the internal investigation Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Mr McCabe lacked candor  including under oath  on multiple occasions That is a fireable offense and Mr Sessions said that career apolitical employees at the FBI and Justice Department agreed that Mr McCabe should be firedAt issue is whether Mr McCabe was forthcoming with investigators about what Mr Sessions said was an unauthorized disclosure to the news mediaMr McCabe authorized an FBI spokesman and lawyer to speak to The Journal to rebut suggestions that he had put the brakes on the investigation These types of interactions between journalists and government officials  known as background calls  are common in all federal agencies and administrations as officials try to correct inaccuracies or provide details and nuance before reporters publish informationThe Journal ultimately reported that while Justice Department officials did not authorize subpoenas the FBI in fact had pressed ahead with the case  a detail that if anything was damaging to Mrs Clinton not Mr TrumpNo As a career civil servant Mr McCabe is not a political appointee who can be summarily dismissed by the president But this is where the situation gets complicated Mr Trump has repeatedly used his Twitter account to attack Mr McCabe Months before the firing he taunted Mr McCabe about his pensionAnd he goaded Mr Sessions into taking action against Mr McCabeOn the eve of Mr McCabes firing the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called him a bad actor Taken together this unusual level of White House commentary created a political backdrop to what should have been an independent government personnel decision Mr McCabes lawyers seized on that as evidence of improper influenceThat is one of the big unknowns FBI disciplinary matters can drag out for extended periods and it is not uncommon for officials to retire during that process That did not happen here and it is not clear why The workings of the FBIs disciplinary office are kept confidentialMr McCabes lawyers say they were given little time to read and respond to the final report and were still receiving new evidence two days before his firing Why the rush they ask if not to make sure that Mr McCabe was firedThis concerted effort to accelerate the process in order to beat the ticking clock of his scheduled retirement violates any sense of decency and basic principles of fairness Mr Bromwich saidMr Trump has seized on the fact that Mr McCabes wife Jill ran for a Virginia State Senate seat as a Democrat and received hundreds of thousands of dollars in campaign donations from a political ally of Mrs Clinton He says Mr McCabe never should have been allowed to oversee the Clinton investigation He says the campaign donations are proof that a proClinton bias within the FBI explains why Mrs Clinton was never chargedMr Trump brought up Mr McCabes wife on several occasions including a facetoface meeting in which the president called her a loserYes and no Mr McCabe did not begin supervising the Clinton investigation until after his wife had lost the race and records show that he sought ethics and legal advice inside the FBI before deciding not to recuse himself But some in the FBI believe he should never have been involved because of his wifes campaign donationsWhen he ultimately recused himself late in the investigation it only fueled the argument that he should have stepped aside from the beginningMr Trumps theory of Mr McCabe as a proClinton partisan however is on far shakier ground Mr McCabe has identified himself as a lifelong Republican and did not vote in the 2016 election The newspaper story that Mr McCabe authorized FBI officials speak about was not a positive one for Mrs ClintonAnd perhaps most importantly in the months before the election when the FBI publicly disclosed information about its work on the Clinton investigation it never revealed the existence and scope of a fullthroated investigation into the Trump campaigns Russia tiesLike so much at the FBI Mr McCabes firing has become inextricably entangled in presidential politics and the investigation by the special counsel Robert S Mueller IIIMr McCabe was one of only a handful of FBI officials involved in the Russia investigation from the first days He supervised it at every step and was involved in the decision to seek a wiretap on Carter Page a former Trump foreign adviser That wiretap application was approved by senior Justice Department officials was reapproved by Mr Trumps own Justice Department and was signed by a federal judge based on evidence that Mr Page was a Russian agent Mr Trump has declared that wiretap to be improper however and points to it as evidence of political surveillance by the FBIMr McCabe also worked alongside the FBI director James B Comey who accused Mr Trump of seeking a loyalty oath and pressing him to end the investigation Those conversations are now part of an obstruction investigation Mr McCabe kept memos on his conversations with Mr Comey which could help investigators corroborate Mr Comeys accountFrom a political standpoint if Mr Trump discredits Mr McCabe he can raise questions about everything Mr McCabe has touched  including the Russia investigation Mr McCabes allies have come to his defenseWhat we know right now is that Mr Sessions found repeated examples in which Mr McCabe lacked candor And career officials  not Trump appointees  recommended dismissal Mr Sessions accepted that recommendationThe FBI expects every employee to adhere to the highest standards of honesty integrity and accountability Mr Sessions saidMr McCabe denies being untruthful He says he answered every question honestly and when he was misunderstood he reached out to the investigators to correct the recordWe wont be able to assess the allegations or Mr McCabes defense until the inspector generals report is released That is expected sometime this spring Mr McCabe has seen it but cannot discuss it until it is public When it is released his lawyers say he has a pointbypoint rebuttal to offerAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bymr', 'mccabe', 'is', 'a', '21year', 'fbi', 'veteran',

67,AdvertisementSupported byMr Trump has made clear that his frustration with Mr Sessions the former Alabama senator who was one of his earliest campaign supporters stems from the attorney generals decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russias interference in the 2016 election and whether Mr Trumps associates conspired with RussiaThe pattern has fueled suspicion that Mr Trump is trying to bully Mr Sessions into resigning  and might fire him if he does not leave voluntarily  in order to clear the way for a replacement who would take control of that investigation Here is a breakdown of possible legal and procedural paths such a maneuver could takeIf Mr Trump were to order Mr Mueller fired and Mr Rosenstein refused  and then resigned or was himself fired by Mr Trump  it could set up a repetition of the socalled Saturday Night Massacre of 1973 in which Richard M Nixons search for a Justice Department official willing to fire the special counsel investigating the Watergate scandal prompted a cascade of resignations That would increase political risks for Mr TrumpA new attorney general who is not recused from the TrumpRussia investigation would take over from Mr Rosenstein as the overseer of the special counsel investigation and could fire Mr Mueller  either by declaring that Mr Mueller has overstepped in some way or by first modifying Justice Department regulations to eliminate the rule protecting special counselsA new attorney general could also declare that the regular Justice Department can handle the investigation after all disbanding Mr Muellers staff And he or she could direct investigators to swiftly wrap up their work while narrowly interpreting their jurisdiction such as limiting their ability to scrutinize whether Mr Trumps interactions with James B Comey the former FBI director fired by the president amounted to obstruction of justiceIt could If the chamber goes into a formal recess before leaving Washington next month for its annual break Mr Trump could make recess appointments while senators are on vacationYes Congress can prevent presidents from making appointments during its breaks by holding socalled pro forma sessions in which a senator comes into the otherwiseempty chamber every few days and bangs the gavel That technically breaks up a long recess into a series of short ones  each too brief to trigger appointment powersThat is not clear The Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer Democrat of New York called upon Republicans on Tuesday to use pro forma sessions in August to prevent Mr Trump from appointing someone during the August recess who will fire Special Counsel Mueller and shut down the Russia investigation He also vowed that Democrats would try to do that on their own if Republicans refusedBefore the Senate adjourns for more than three days Congress adopts a concurrent resolution giving it the authority to do so That is normally routine but Democrats are discussing whether to try to block any upordown vote on such a resolution by offering an unlimited series of amendments to its date and time for reconvening If the Senate gives up and leaves town without such a resolution the Constitution would require pro forma sessions every three days blocking recess appointmentsAlan S Frumin who served as the Senates chief parliamentarian from 1987 to 1995 and from 2001 to 2012 said Republicans could quash such a filibuster by amendment using what some call the nuclear option to change the rules Under that scenario if a majority of senators vote to deem the Democrats amendments dilatory they could adjourn in a way that leaves Mr Trump free to make recess appointments But if at least three Republican senators break ranks the Senate would need to meet every three daysThe Constitution also says that if the House and Senate disagree when to adjourn the president may adjourn them to such time as he shall think proper That suggests Mr Trump might be able to force the Senate into a lengthy recess But no president has tried to exercise this power and it is not clear what would constitute such a disagreement Mr Frumin said that the House typically gives its consent for the Senate to adjourn for more than three days but does not order the Senate to do soThis would be an enormous political and constitutional danger he said If he can force them into adjournment he can in essence terminate CongressFiring Mr Sessions and Mr Mueller would be a shocking moment for Washington where many Republicans in Congress have expressed support for Mr Mueller and conservatives like Mr Sessions But Republicans have also shown no appetite for impeachment proceedings to replace Mr Trump with Vice President Pence and it is an open question what if anything it would take to change thatOn Tuesday House Speaker Paul D Ryan Republican of Wisconsin was asked about Mr Trump apparently laying the groundwork to fire Mr Sessions and make a recess appointment of someone who could fire Mr Mueller He was asked if he was concernedLook the president gets to decide what his personnel is Mr Ryan replied adding He determines who gets hired and fired in the executive branch Thats his prerogativeEileen Sullivan contributed reportingAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bymr', 'trump', 'has', 'made', 'clear', 'that', 'his', 'frustration', 'with',

69,AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisThe shifting statements also illustrated starkly why some of the presidents lawyers have urged him not to submit to an interview by the special counsel Robert S Mueller III who is investigating whether Mr Trumps campaign cooperated with Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president obstructed justice to thwart that investigation Those lawyers have said Mr Mueller is setting a perjury trap for Mr Trump What they do not say publicly is that they worry the president would be unable to avoid contradicting himselfUnder the unforgiving glare of federal prosecutors however misrepresentations carry far greater jeopardy In nearly a year on the case Mr Mueller has shown that he is more than willing to charge associates of Mr Trump with lying to investigators independent lawyers have said it would be reckless for the presidents lawyers to allow him to be interviewed Even supporters who maintain that Mr Trump is essentially a truth teller acknowledge that he can be loose with detailsFor Mr Trump it is about creating a narrative that suits his desired image and dictating the terms of his own life  in media coverage in his business in politics even in his medical care But he now risks losing his grip on the story line he has long sought to control in part because of his own treatment of associates like his doctor and the lawyer who paid the porn starThis weeks revelation about the true origin of the doctors statement may not have surprised many When Dr Harold N Bornstein released a letter in December 2015 saying that Mr Trump would be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency few believed it was authentic It contained the exact language about strength and stamina that the candidate often used to describe himselfFrom complete denial to acknowledging involvement what President Trump and his lawyers said about the 130000 paid to the pornographic film actressBut in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday night Rudolph W Giuliani the former New York mayor now serving as a lawyer for the president said Mr Trump had reimbursed Mr Cohen for the moneyIn a followup interview on Thursday morning Mr Giuliani said Mr Trump did not actually learn the specifics until recently He didnt know the details of this until we knew the details of this which was a couple weeks ago Mr Giuliani said Maybe not even a couple  maybe 10 days agoMr Giuliani seemed less concerned with explaining Mr Trumps previous denial than with emphasizing that it was the candidates personal money and therefore could not be a violation of campaign finance law He said the payment to Ms Clifford as part of a nondisclosure agreement was made in October 2016 only to protect Mr Trumps family from a false allegation not to influence the election less than two weeks laterWhile others might think paying 130000 to someone who was making a false allegation was hard to fathom for a wealthy man like Mr Trump it was not quite pocket change but its pretty close to it Mr Giuliani saidWhen Cohen heard 130000 he said My God this is cheap  they come cheap Let me get the thing signed up and signed off Mr Giuliani addedOn Fox News Mr Giuliani attributed the decision to Mr Comeys refusal to publicly exonerate Mr Trump in the Russia investigation He fired Comey because Comey would not among other things say that he wasnt a target of the investigation Mr Giuliani said Since then Mr Muellers office has told the White House that Mr Trump is a subject though not a target of the investigationBut some still wondered whether it was an unscripted comment especially given that it came up almost casually at the end of a long interview with Sean Hannity the Fox News host Mr Giuliani and Mr Trump have a long and deep relationship The former mayor has the presidents ear  and understands how to communicate with him  in a way that few others doStill Mr Giuliani is a former big city mayor accustomed to being an executive and his ability to simply carry out orders without adding his own flair has always been in questionEither way the last few days have shown that Mr Trumps narrative is now at least in part in the hands of others  his lawyers his friends his doctor his accusers lawyer even his investigators And for a man who prefers to craft his own story line that is not a comfortable situationMaggie

70,AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisWASHINGTON  Lost in the showdown between President Trump and James B Comey that played out this past week was a chilling threat to the United States Mr Comey the former director of the FBI testified that the Russians had not only intervened in last years election but would try to do it againWhat started out as a counterintelligence investigation to guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed into a political scandal about what Mr Trump did what he said and what he meant by it Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the FBI director he fired with cascading requests for documents recordings and hearingsBut from the headquarters of the National Security Agency to state capitals that have discovered that the Russians were inside their voterregistration systems the worry is that attention will be diverted from figuring out how Russia disrupted American democracy last year and how to prevent it from happening again Russian hackers did not just breach Democratic email accounts according to Mr Comey they orchestrated a massive effort targeting hundreds of  and possibly more than 1000  American government and private organizations since 2015Its important for us in the West to understand that were facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons to do us harm said Daniel Fried a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year Whatever the domestic politics of this Comey was spoton right that Russia is coming after us but not just the US but the free world in general And we need to take this seriouslyMr Comeys willingness to discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart As FBI director he supervised counterintelligence investigations into computer breakins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House and that penetrated deep into the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Yet President Barack Obamas administration did not want to publicize those intrusions choosing to handle them diplomatically  perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort to manipulate American politicsMr Comeys special agents failed to react aggressively to evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young informationtechnology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organizations emails Only when emails from Hillary Clintons presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operationIn October Mr Comey declined to sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election  not because he doubted the evidence aides later said the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem too political so close to Election Day Now many members of Mr Obamas national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlierAnd there is no evidence that the Russians have stopped The NSA suspects that a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers which has published tools used by the agency to breach foreign computer networks is a front for Russia probably the GRU the military intelligence armThe Homeland Security Department is also looking at new evidence of computer code buried in the electrical power grid Russia is believed to be behind two major attacks on Ukraines grid and there are warnings that those techniques could also be turned on the United StatesThe strategys central concept she said refined in attacks on Eastern European countries is that it is better to collapse a country from withinEric S Edelman who was an under secretary of defense under President George W Bush said Russian information warfare capabilities were highly developed In the Cold War the Soviet efforts in this regard were hamhanded and could be countered with relative ease he said Today the Russians are much more sophisticated and they see things like disinformation propaganda and what we used to call active measures as part of a suite of capabilitiesGraham Allison a longtime Russia scholar at Harvard said Russias cyberintrusion into the recent presidential election signals the beginning of what is almost sure to be an intensified cyberwar in which both they  and we  seek to participate in picking the leaders of an adversary The difference he added is that American elections are generally fair so we are much more vulnerable to such manipulation than is Russia where results are often preordainedIn Washington however the issue has become partisan because Mr Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as fake news generated by Democrats to explain their defeatHe repeated that during a news conference on Friday That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldnt have lost he saidMr Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russias role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday Mr Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing to protect against future Russian interventionThere should be no fuzz on this whatsoever Mr Comey said The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle They did it with purpose They did it with sophistication They did it with overwhelming technical efforts And it was an activemeasures campaign driven from the top of that government There is no fuzz on thatHe added Thats about as unfake as you can possibly get and is very very seriousWhat we didnt talk enough about was the purpose we were there about Russias involvement and Russias intent how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue to keep trying and hitting on us to change how we do business in America how we elect our officials the confidence we have in our government Senator Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia said Friday on Morning Joe on MSNBCSimilar warnings have been issued by others in the intelligence community led by James R Clapper Jr who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as director of national intelligence I dont think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing he said recentlyBut few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams  they started a scandal that has consumed the American political processThey can win two ways Senator Sheldon Whitehouse a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee said Thursday They can do it trying to influence votes or they can get caught doing it and undercut confidence in the American electoral systemFollow Peter Baker and David Sanger on Twitter peterbakernyt sangernytAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

71,AdvertisementSupported byNight OutThe 730 pm show had already started and there were no seats left But Mr Fowler 29 who has sleepy eyes a wayward smile and hair that looks like fireworks in midexplosion wasnt in a hurryWearing a customdesigned denim jacket with Ya Got Spirit Kid lettered on the back he bopped around the sidewalk catching up with the clubs managers and security Before he moved to Los Angeles last year for the TV show which also stars Judd Hirsch Mr Fowler was a regular at the Comedy CellarThe managers and bouncers teased him about his Jermaine Hendrix hair and having gone all Hollywood and waitresses stopped by for hugs He hadnt seen them since August when hed stopped in on the way back from his mothers funeralMr Fowler started doing standup at 17 and moved to New York from Hyattsville Md about nine years ago The Comedy Cellar was one of the first clubs to give him a regular slotAfter his 10minute routine he loped upstairs to the comedians table and downed a few sips of a fruit juice blend heavy on the maraschino cherries Mr Fowler doesnt drink much ever since an incident about five years ago outside a nearby 7Eleven when he and a couple of fellow comics were inebriated and got into a brawl with a group of men over a misunderstanding about a taxi A brick was thrown and they ran away before the police arrivedAfter that I was like no more appletinis he saidHe had more old friends to see so he slipped into the Comedy Cellars sister club the Fat Black Pussycat on nearby West Third Street stopping to remind the bouncer Steven King that hed ordered a bunch of Girl Scout cookies from his daughter and never received them Mr King who chuckled when another bouncer greeted Mr Fowler as Sideshow Bob did not seem especially racked with guiltThey ordered fried dumplings sesame pancakes and an orangeade The worst of the Snapples said Mr Fowler who was shocked to see that Vanessas now takes debit cardsMr Fowler showed off photos of his 3monthold Then the conversation turned to anime bad action movies and whether Mr Keneally should get a tattoo There was more teasing about Mr Fowlers hairHe headed out toward the subway observing how much had changed It hadnt been that long since Mr Fowler had lived in New York but as he came to the corner of Broome Street he lost his bearings His friends tried to point him the wrong way but he was on to themThey set off toward Union Square passing graffiti that read Laugh Even When Its Not Funny It was questionable advice And as Mr Fowler walked on telling jokes about pizza that tasted like tomato paste and Ovenglow no one needed to take itAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,movies,"['advertisementsupported', 'bynight', 'outthe', '730', 'pm', 'show', 'had', 'already', 'started', 'and', 'there',

mineAfter Congress passed the 19th Amendment in 1919 ratification needed to occur in 36 states for womens right to vote to become federal law By July 1920 the possible 36th state  or the place where the amendment would die after 70 years of strenuous activism  was Tennessee Thus for several weeks that summer in and around Nashvilles statehouse a frenetic pageant of political organizing lobbying demonstrating and doublecrossing unfolded among the Antis who opposed the amendment and the Suffs or suffragists who supported it As one legislator declared The entire world today has cast its eyes on TennesseeWeiss presents a panoramic view of the proceedings which are alternately juicy accusations of libel and bribery abounded and in spite of Prohibition the whiskey and bourbon were freeflowing and procedural Weiss also provides national and international context World War I had ended less than two years earlier and both the war and its aftermath had jumbled established norms of gender race and employment In the United States a physically ailing Woodrow Wilson occupied the White House and two Ohioans Warren Harding and James Cox were vying to replace him which raised the stakes of the 19th Amendments passage Though women in some states could already vote it was unclear how enfranchising all 27 million American women in time for the falls presidential election would influence national politicsIn addition to offering contemporaneous perspective Weiss goes back several decades to the roots of the womens movement and the efforts of Susan B Anthony Elizabeth Cady Stanton and others Weiss celebrates their persistence and courage but does not sugarcoat their racism Despite early unity with abolitionists uppermiddleclass white women willing to sacrifice racial equality for gender equality is nothing new During the ratification in Nashville Carrie Catt the New Yorkbased president of the National American Woman Suffrage Association and the successor to Susan B Anthony made calculated decisions to distance her groups interests from those of black men and women After all much of the Anti reluctance to grant women the vote was tied up with not wanting black women to voteWeiss details the tribalism within the womens movement as personified by Catt and the more militant and provocative Alice Paul who led the National Womans Party Though Paul was short on money and didnt travel to Nashville for the special session she dispatched the native Tennessean Sue Shelton White an activist who could with her very accent dispel accusations about meddling outsiders Weiss depicts another native daughter of Tennessee this one a committed Anti Josephine Pearson who presided over multiple Anti groups and believed that in fighting against ratification she was obeying both

73,AdvertisementSupported byOn WashingtonWASHINGTON  Appalling Disturbing Partisan Completely puzzlingNow Democrats are embracing Mr Comey a man many of them blame for Mr Trumps election as a star witness in the investigation into Russian election meddling and potentially problematic behavior by the presidentI have long disagreed with Comey about surveillance about encryption about secret legal interpretations said Senator Ron Wyden the Oregon Democrat and Intelligence Committee veteran But I continue to believe the timing of the decision to fire James Comey just stinksDemocrats do not intend to dwell on the awkward past at Thursdays hearing which is conjuring a level of anticipation associated only with that most riveting of Washington set pieces a televised congressional hearing reaching into the Oval Office Instead they say they simply want to determine whether Mr Trump took steps to thwart Mr Comey in overseeing an investigation into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia related to the electionI just want to know whether this administration or this president ever tried to interfere with him doing his job said Senator Martin Heinrich a New Mexico Democrat and member of the Intelligence Committee I didnt always agree with his judgment but that is different from trying to interfere with his daytoday operations at the FBIDemocrats have not always been so restrained in their assessment of Mr Comey Many were apoplectic over his announcement  just days before Novembers election  that he had resumed a federal inquiry into whether Mrs Clinton mishandled classified information through her use of a private email server as secretary of state Some Democrats were already fed up with Mr Comey after he announced in July that he would not recommend charges against Mrs Clinton while delivering a stinging critique of her conduct Lawmakers and many in the Justice Department concluded Mr Comey had acted outside his authorityHarry Reid then the Senate Democratic leader suggested Mr Comey had broken the law and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California then the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee spoke for many of her colleagues when she called his actions shocking and appalling Others were even more stridentThe difference in tone was not lost on Senator Mitch McConnell the Kentucky Republican and majority leader in response to Democratic outrage at the firing of Mr Comey in early MaySo what we have now Mr McConnell said at the time is our Democratic colleagues complaining about the removal of an FBI director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticizedDemocrats say that despite their reservations about Mr Comey they see him as a dedicated public servant who performed in a variety of difficult roles and deserved better than his treatment by Mr TrumpThose who have assailed Mr Comey in the past say it is perfectly legitimate to now defend his efforts to get to the bottom of the presidents actionsIt is possible to both think that what Comey did last year is really terrible and that he shouldnt be fired for conducting an investigation into the presidents campaign said Matthew Miller a former Justice Department spokesman who has been sharply critical of Mr ComeyWashington always oversimplifies everything he said Comeys good or Comeys bad But the reality is more complex I think what he did last year was a firing offense but that doesnt mean the president can fire him for something different when doing it is potentially obstruction of justiceIf there is a loose string I will try to pull on it Mr Heinrich said What we are talking about is whether or not the Russians were manipulating our election cycle and what role the president may or may not have had with interfering with this investigationThis Mr Wyden said is an opportunity to get on the record what the status of the investigation was at the time of his firing The president would do well to remember that in America the truth always comes outDemocrats have a complicated history with Mr Comey But in this case their connection is as simple as this old saying The enemy of my enemy is my friendAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

74,AdvertisementSupported byOpEd ContributorsEmily Bazelon a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the Truman Capote Fellow at Yale Law School and Elizabeth Goitein the codirector of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan center watched James B Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee today where the former FBI director discussed the investigation into Russian interference in the presidential electionMoving forward if this hearing is any indication Trumps defenders will be trying to portray Trumps pressuring Comey to drop the Flynn investigation as an isolated incident a president who simply didnt know any better going a bit too far trying to get a friend off the hook It will be up to lawmakers journalists and others to keep the focus on the bigger picture and keep pushing for answers on the nature of Trump associates ties to RussiaBut lets take a real step back to the very beginning Last summer and fall a hostile foreign power used hackers to try to get a candidate Donald Trump elected The FBI determined there was sufficient evidence that Trumps campaign colluded with Russia in this effort to open an investigation which continues to this day The president asked Comey then the FBI director to pledge his loyalty and to shut down one part of the investigation When the director didnt comply he was fired And the intelligence committee hearing on all of this proceeded like it was just another partisan fight about tax cuts The word surreal comes to mindThe full conversation that they had during the hearing is belowOf course the key questions going into today were all about influence and pressure and how much of each the president can legitimately exert over the FBI director who was investigating his campaign and key players in his administrationLiza what did we learn from the released statement yesterday that mattered most I saw Trumps defenders and critics both doubling down Is that because we are in a grey area in which we see the president tromping all over norms of FBI and Justice Department independence without necessarily seeing clear indictable proof of the crime of obstruction of justice Or is that the wrong standard since what matters is the political bar for obstruction which means its up to Congress It seems as if these shouldnt be partisan questions Yet they areTheres no serious argument that this is appropriate behavior from an American president Imagine for a moment testimony that President Barack Obama or a hypothetical President Hillary Clinton had a similar conversation with an FBI director The entire conservativemedia world would erupt in outrage and rightly so The FBI director is a lawenforcement officer loyal to the Constitution not the presidents consigliereComey said he had no regrets about his decision last July and October to publicly discuss the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons private email server What he did broke with Justice Department practice Democrats have intensely criticized him for itI dont really think Trump was drawing conclusions in the way that Lowry implies It seems more likely that the president was just trying to get what he wanted But is there something to the underlying idea that Comey himself scrambled the rules for what should and shouldnt be public in the context of a highly politicized FBI investigationAnd by the way how telling is it that the former director of the FBI testified that he felt he needed to document every encounter with Trump because given the nature of the person he felt Trump might lie He actually used the L word Its a relief to hear after listening to all the tortured synonyms reporters come up with to try to avoid calling it what it is Its not just a personal foible and acknowledging it isnt an ad hominem attack When the president lies it undermines the workings of democracyTrump is right about the cloud hanging over him Comey set a bad precedent last summer and I hope the FBI ditches it Though with Washington leaking like a sieve its very hard to imagine how the agency could start investigating Trump personally and keep it a secret But really its for Congress  in particular the Senate Intelligence Committee to give a public accountingBut moving on weve repeatedly heard suggestions today that if Trump was only trying to get the FBI to back off from one person Flynn thats not a big problem But of course it is For one thing we have no idea how central Flynn might be to the larger Russia investigation as I mentioned before Even more important this goes to the heart of one of the most dangerous attributes of this president His lack of respect for the rule of lawAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported',

75,AdvertisementSupported byOscarsSoWhite meet OscarsSoContriteHe came with his ax sharp Mr Rock had been signed to host the awards before the controversy but it was a lucky pairing of host and subject You have to wonder if the academy was anticipating it less with dread than with relief If Mr Rock flogged Hollywood properly enough the Oscars  along with the academys reforms  might come across as a kind of public penanceChris Rock provoked Spotlight stunned  and not every joke landed quite right Here are some of the most memorable moments of the nightMr Rocks set which he had been trying out at the Comedy Store in Los Angeles went straight at it welcoming the audience to the ceremony otherwise known as the White Peoples Choice Awards19 PhotosMonica AlmeidaThe New York TimesMr Rock in other words wasnt about to let anyone off the hook  including people who had called on him to quit the gig in protest The last thing I need is to lose another job to Kevin Hart His set managed to be evenhanded without being wishywashy He reassured the crowd that Hollywood wasnt burningcross racist but  as he deftly put it  it was sorority racist Its like We like you Rhonda but youre not a KappaNor did the critique end with the monologue Mr Rock and the shows writers made it the narrative engine for an awards show that had few urgent rivalries or tossups Though there was a surprise best picture winner Spotlight A brilliant followup sketch integrated some lilywhite scenes in notable movies Whoopi Goldberg pushing a mop in Joy Tracy Morgan in The Danish Girl Mr Rock introduced the shouldabeen nominee Michael B Jordan of Creed56 PhotosNoel West for The NYTThe jokes didnt always work  a cameo introducing the minority outreach official Stacey Dash a conservative actress who had criticized Black History Month on Fox News seemed to perplex much of the audience and perhaps also Ms Dash And one of the few acknowledgments of Asians in the broadcast was an awkward gag in which Mr Rock introduced three Asian children as the PricewaterhouseCoopers accountantsBut others landed like a visit to a Compton movie theater where Mr Rock asked moviegoers if theyd seen nominated movies like Bridge of Spies A bit of trivia Mr Rock did a version of the bit the last time he hosted in 2005  but in that years monologue he noted that there were several black acting nominees History repeats but it doesnt always progressAnother bit of repeating history was that though the show was energized by Mr Rocks comedy it still dragged with oddly staged bits like a performance by the Weeknd of Earned It that featured an aerial performer Simpler and more powerful was Lady Gagas singing Til It Happens to You from the documentary The Hunting Ground surrounded by survivors of sexual assaultAs a TV show at least the Oscars seemed to be aware both that a lack of diversity was a flaw it needed to address and that paradoxically the controversy and Mr Rocks response made the broadcast interesting His performance was an example of something the industry is still trying to learn that you can achieve both inclusion and entertainment by giving the right person just the right

76,AdvertisementSupported byPARIS  Mario Draghi the European Central Bank president strongly signaled on Friday that he and his colleagues were preparing a new round of powerful monetary stimulus to jolt the flagging eurozone economyWhile slowing growth was the reason for Beijings move in Europe the big concern is a worrisomely low inflation rate that is both a symptom and cause of the 18nation euro currency unions inability to achieve any sustainable growth at allSpeaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt Mr Draghi said the European Central Bank would do what we must to raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possibleIf the banks current policies which include some purchases of corporate bonds do not end the threat Mr Draghi said we would step up the pressure and broaden even more the channels through which we intervene by altering accordingly the size pace and composition of our purchasesAt issue is whether the European Central Bank will follow its peers around the world including the Federal Reserve in the United States the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England in buying government bonds on a large scale a policy known as quantitative easingWith interest rates around most of the developed world having been effectively cut to as low as they can go conventional monetary policy has reached its zero lower bound While there is no consensus on the effectiveness of quantitative easing many economists point to the relatively strong British and American recoveries as evidence that it worksThe risk Mr Draghi now runs is that unless the central banks actions keep pace with his words he can lose credibility Many economists have been pushing for most of this year for the central bank to take more aggressive stimulus steps while Mr Draghi in his monthly news conferences has been saying the equivalent of stay tunedIf after Fridays statements Mr Draghi is unable to announce significant new measures when he and his governing council meet in early December the financial markets could register their disappointment Some analysts immediately predicted though that Mr Draghi was simply trying to buy more timeMr Draghi will find himself even more on the spot at the December meeting if a closely watched report on eurozone inflation next week shows prices falling furtherMr Draghi spoke Friday as the worlds central banks are increasingly concerned that very low inflation will tip into outright deflation  a selfreinforcing condition in which consumers and businesses put off purchases and investments in the expectation that prices will fall Deflation can also crush fragile borrowers by raising the real interest rate on their loans which would load weak banks with a new round of defaults on loansEurozone consumer prices rose just 04 percent in October far below the central banks target of close to but less than 2 percent In fact some member states have already begun to experience deflation Mr Draghi and his peers are afraid that consumers and investors will increasingly see low inflation as the new normal creating a selffulfilling prophecyThe European Central Bank in September cut its main interest rate target to a rockbottom 005 percent and reduced its deposit rate to minus 02 percent effectively charging banks for leaving unused funds at the central bank The bank has been buying privatesector loan assets since early October And it has announced longerterm lowinterest loans to banks in an effort to restart lendingSo far that has not been enough Recently Mr Draghi has said the central bank intends to expand the size of its balance sheet  that is to inject money into the market  by 1 trillion euros or about 125 trillion Economists say the current measures fall far short of what is needed to hit that levelMichel Martinez chief eurozone economist with Socit Gnrale noted that Mr Draghi had not provided much detail about his inflationfighting plans Mr Martinez said he expected the central bank to increase its purchases of privatesector assets including packages of housing loans known as covered bonds as well as of debt issued by agencies like the European Investment BankBut when you do the math you make a rough assumption that the ECB takes 20 percent of all those available assets Mr Martinez said Thats barely 400 billionIf Mr Draghi is going to hit his target Mr Martinez added obviously the answer is to purchase government bondsExpectations that the central bank will increase the supply of euros in the market led investors to sell the European currency in favor of dollars particularly as the Federal Reserve has begun reining in its own bondbuying The euro fell about 1 percent to 12438 in afternoon trading The Euro Stoxx 50 index gained 297 percent Yields on Spanish and Italian 10year bonds fell roughly 1 percentAnd yet the path to employing wholesale bondbuying is not an easy one There is significant opposition to such a policy in Germany for example and even if the political hurdles are overcome economists say they wonder whether the eurozone  in which each country rather than the bloc as a whole issues bonds  is the appropriate venue for quantitative easingTwo of Germanys gatekeepers on the question of quantitative easing  the governments finance minister Wolfgang Schuble and the German central banks president Jens Weidmann  addressed the same conference on Friday but declined to comment on Mr Draghis speechIn any case Mr Martinez said he was not convinced that Mr Draghi was ready to act in the near term perhaps not before next summerThe ECB is buying time in the hope that the outlook improves he saidGuntram B Wolff who follows the European economy as director of the Brusselsbased research institute Bruegel agreedMy take is that it will still take some time before Mr Draghi commits to buying government bonds Mr Wolff said My sense is that the German government is moving toward the position that this may have to happen at some point to prevent a catastrophe in terms of prolonged low inflation or even deflation It has serious implications for Germany tooAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,banking,"['advertisementsupported', 'byparis', 'mario',

77,AdvertisementSupported byPlaylistAt the Thanksgiving Day LionsVikings football game Aretha Franklin took the national anthem to church and kept it there for four lavishly unhurried minutes The instrumental lineup  Ms Franklin on piano backed by an organist  should have been a tipoff that deep gospel was in store This wasnt a song to get out of the way before the game could start This would be an anthem treated like a classic spiritual taking the time to contemplate every word and every phrase with deep concentration and improvisational abandon Ms Franklin made the song a patient circuitous ultimately spectacular ascent from a husky inwardlooking start to an airborne finale through husky assurances and bluesy sufferings through grainy determination and powerful purity The last line of the verse is a question  Does that starspangled banner yet wave  but Ms Franklin turned it into a flatout affirmation It is the land of the free the free she sang We are the home of the brave JPOf Garth Brookss many modes perhaps his most convincing  in this the late middle of his career  is dad mode Theres something in the way he declaims it connotes certainty sympathy and resignation This approach is at its most intense on Ask Me How I Know from his strong new album Gunslinger which in the hands of a lesser singer would be a scold but is instead a reassuring arm around the shoulder And when you start to fall you hung on to your prideStart building up your walls and never let her get insideYoull push her away cause thats all you know how to doIm messing up all of Drakes wordson purpose Chance the Rapper sings midway through this cover of Drakes Feel No Ways a song about feeling the sharp lash of recrimination from someone you once loved Chances version is both brighter and more insular his band backs him with spare cushioning synthesizers When he sings I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do the exultation matched by bright synth dollops is a shift from Drakes resentment Chance also changes a few words and adds a few lines that feel perhaps aimed at a specific person whos done him wrong We need to breatheTheres more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to meWe had to let go of us to show ourselves what we could be JCThe experimental alto saxophonist and composer Matana Roberts didnt release an album this year but that doesnt mean she wasnt busy  touring at home and abroad organizing residencies forging new collaborations Last month she settled in for a few days at Caf Oto in London working with English partners including the pianist Alexander Hawkins the trumpeter Byron Wallen and the electronics artist Leafcutter John The results sparked with exploratory frictions as you can hear on the sanctioned bootlegs that Ms Roberts recently posted online three roughly 40minute improvisations all well worth hearing though maybe not backtoback NCTease comeon and afterglow merge in Maniac which finds a percussive path to sensual bliss You just made love to a maniac Ms Aiko reminds a partner Like a longevolved descendant of Princes Erotic City by way of Janet Jackson and fka twigs the production is all plinks ratchets whooshes and twitches virtually every bit of harmony comes from Ms Aikos many vocals She raps crisply through verses that hop in and out of double time as they juxtapose desire and demands Anywhere everywhere you turn me to addictIf you love me like you say you do then get it tatted And then she glides into choruses that hover and coo offering the promise of sweet proud insatiability JPWhat sort of suave is Aloe Blacc On his new single Real Slow he ventures the most conflicted sort of comeon proposing intimacy as a shield against worldly troubles Do you feel like theres a place for you and me in the home of the brave and the land of the free he asks in a ratatat stream The tracks terse hiphop background is the work of DJ Khalil who also produced most of Aloe Blaccs 2013 album Lift Your Spirit The silky assurance of the singing helps sell the feeling of a confiding almost clandestine seduction We can dance with our eyes closed the suitor suggests before spinning out the

78,AdvertisementSupported bySo what about Nancy PelosiOne of the more dramatic sidelights in that dramatic congressional election in Pennsylvania was the way Republicans attempted to turn the whole campaign into a Pelosi referendumIf you lived in the Pittsburgh area you saw multitudinous ads warning that Democrat Conor Lamb would join Pelosis liberal flock if he won People there will probably spend the spring wandering around muttering Nancy Pelosi and Conor Lamb Are Still Opposing Your Tax CutYou cannot watch TV at any time of the day or night without seeing the mudslinging campaigns one reader complained to the Pittsburgh PostGazette Its tough all the advertising overkill that comes with a tight election Those of us who live in districts where the typical contest is a 12term incumbent versus anything the opposition can dig up  a woman who just moved into the state a guy who just got out of prison on an arson conviction a 12yearold Chihuahua  are so luckyFor Pelosi the only downside to Lambs victory was the part where he promised hed never vote to keep her on as leader My take is if these people have been around for several years and they havent solved these problems that have been hanging around its time for someone new to step up and get it doneSo what does this all meanA Pelosi loses How many other Democrats in tough races will promise to replace her Its a hell of a lot easier than balancing the budgetB Pelosi wins Look she would have been perfectly happy to have Lamb call her a voodoopriestess puppykiller if it got her another seatC Republicans selfimmolate People who bet their political fortunes on the presumption that voters care whos the House minority leader deserve what they getOK its very possible that your average voter is not all that obsessed with Nancy Pelosi But I know youre different concerned citizen And she really has been through a lot David Barker a government professor at American University thinks the Republican effort to portray Pelosi as an ubervillain may be unique historically speaking And the reason Barker adds has to be at least partially related to genderPelosi doesnt really love the idea that the Republicans hatred is about sexism I dont think its because Im a woman Its because Im an effective leader she said in a phone interviewOr it could be both Pelosi is famous as a behindthescenes tactician When the Democrats controlled the House and Barack Obama was president she singlehandedly dragged the Affordable Care Act to passage like a firefighter rescuing a comatose 300pound fifthfloor resident from a burning building And as a fundraiser shes a veritable vacuum cleanerShe sounds as if she wants to stay I wouldnt give that up lightly she said of her job Nor do the women of the country want me toBut the Democrats in the House arent all enthusiastic Some have been saying they want a leader whos younger more open to new ideas less likely to become a political meme for the opposition I do think its time to pass the torch to a new generation said Representative Linda Snchez 49 in a recent TV interviewYou do have to admit the Democratic leadership is looking a little  nonfresh Pelosi turns 78 this month The next two people in line  Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn  are equally seniorAnd why is it that the only one being pressured to leave is a woman demanded one of Pelosis friendsWell probably because shes on top Although if she was replaced by the 78yearold Hoyer that would be pretty embarrassing And some of the younger Democrats who are mentioned most often as possible successors  like 56yearold Representative Joe Crowley of Queens  arent exactly new broomsThe ideal solution  except for the other Democrats who are eyeing her job  might be for Pelosi to come back with a new message Maybe she could follow the Republican lead and impose term limits on committee leadership jobs giving junior members a chance to shine The Democrats havent done this because of opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus which argues that the current seniority system is good for minority members Its certainly good for the veteran minority members who have important posts they can keep forever But the younger ambitious black House Democrats are stuck in the same clogged system as their white counterpartsIf the public thinks Pelosi is less than inspiring thats probably because making messy political bargains and fundraising arent exactly celebrated skills these days Polls show House Speaker Paul Ryan is equally unpopular And hes now being Pelosied by a Democratic super PAC with a new ad showing a man whos supposed to be Ryan drinking champagne admiring his hair and working out in the gym in the most selfobsessed manner possible Whoever Speaker Ryan thinks about  it probably isnt you the narrator warnsPlus theres that election in November Right now it seems as if nothing can save the Republican majority Not even promising to get rid of Paul Ryan Although it probably wouldnt hurtGuess Pelosi winsAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'byso', 'what', 'about', 'nancy', 'pelosione', 'of', 'the', 'more',

79,AdvertisementSupported byStar Trek DiscoveryWe would have helped you get home if you had asked Burnham tells Lorca right before he is killedInstead Mirror Lorca went on an odyssey back to the mirror universe with a plan that required a great many things to fall exactly into place He needed to retain command He needed no one to realize that his behavior was different from the nonmirror Lorca He needed the spore drive  an untested technology  to work to perfection He needed the Klingons to not kill him He needed others to not kill him He needed Burnham And he needed a certain type of Burnham for his plan to wholly succeedSo much of the 43minute episode left me scratching my head At times it seemed like the writers themselves did the same A couple minutes in Mirror Landry Welcome back Rekha Sharma says to Lorca I dont know how you got here or how you got us all out alive Its a good point and we dont really get an answer to this  setting a tone of confusion right from the start How did Lorca walk unscathed and free all his supporters who of course happen to be on the ship right after murdering someone and escaping the AgonizerAnd the ending of the episode  that the Discovery crew has time traveled within their normal universe  is another big twist though it was hard to care much about it at least for now Too many plot twists come and go in this show without satisfying resolutions the characters dont even seem that interested in shocking news anymore When Saru finds out that Lorca isnt you know Lorca he reacts as if hes told that the mess hall is out of puddingDiscovery is a bottomline show Its more concerned with plot ends than with the narrative means This leaves viewers with the sort of basic questions that shows answer organically when they dont opt for cheap plot twists over careful story development1 The fight scenesThis week lets raise our glasses to Glen Keenan the shows cinematographer Georgious containment field was eyepopping and the choreography in the superb fight scenes were unlike anything weve seen in Trek Whatever the other flaws Mr Keenans work is a bright spot2 Rekha SharmaIt was wonderful to see Ms Sharma back in action Like many characters this season Landry was killed off far too early wasting an interesting character in the process Along with Georgiou Culber TKuvma and othersWhere to beginThe Star Wars ripoffThis one is slight  but it was enough to get me to shake my fist at the television When Mirror Lorca says to Mirror Stamets Your lack of vision continues to disappoint me it was way too close to Darth Vaders I find your lack of faith disturbing in Star Wars A New Hope It is one of the most famous lines in cinematic history You cant pull off a line like that unless its a direct homage And Lorca is no Darth VaderSo many Wait what momentsMore important there were way too moments during the episode where I was baffled  either by character actions or exposition in the plot An incomplete and notsoshort list Early on Lorca frees his followers from a room of Agonizers Why were they alive to begin with In previous episodes even allies are killed with impunity in the Terran Empire Enemies are shown being beamed into space There is no real incentive for Evil Georgiou to not execute a group trying to pull of a coup An ion storm pushed Mirror Lorca out of his own universe This is a classic Trek plot device We need a way to get from Point A to Point B Get me an ion storm Update Multiple readers have pointed out that an ion storm is how the original Enterprise crew led by Kirk ended up in the mirror universe They are correct so Ill offer a mea culpa on this one I forgot I will however stand by an ion storm being a classic Trek plot device If you understood how Stamets recovered fully and is able to operate the spore drive with no issues you are a more attentive viewer than me Same if you can understand why the spore drive is no longer instantaneous which is the entire point of the thing or why the Terrans bad faith use of the mycelium network would effect other universes Why does Georgiou want Lorca to be brought to her alive She thought he was dead this whole time until Burnham brought him back Why is it important to her that she gets to kill him Boy Burnham is sure able to walk around empty areas of Georgious ship for long periods of time exactly when she needs to even though many people are trying to find her So Burnhams plan when she and Georgiou get to the throne room was to kick the guards And why didnt Lorca just immediately shoot a defenseless Georgiou Uh does anyone know what happened to FrankenTylerVoqenstein Why does Georgiou assume shes a fallen emperor She put down Lorcas coup again Why cant she eliminate his supporters since they have no one to followWhile Im not very invested in the time travel plot thats coming up I am slightly intrigued Saru is captain now More Doug Jones Yes please Im curious about how the writers will approach a world where the Federation has hit a worstcase scenario  having lost a war This has happened before if rarely Things looked bleak in Deep Space Nine during the Dominion War In First Contact the Borg

80,AdvertisementSupported byState of the ArtSnap Inc the parent company of the popular photomessaging and storytelling app Snapchat is having a productive autumnAnd yet even when its grabbing headlines it often seems as if Snap gets little respectThis is all wrong If you secretly harbor the idea that Snapchat is frivolous or somehow a fad its time to reexamine your certainties In fact in various large and small ways Snap has quietly become one of the worlds most innovative and influential consumer technology companiesSnap which is based far outside the Silicon Valley bubble in the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles is pushing radically new ideas about how humans should interact with computers It is pioneering a model of social networking that feels more intimate and authentic than the Facebookled ideas that now dominate the online world Snaps software and hardware designs as well as its marketing strategies are more daring than much of what weve seen from tech giants including AppleSnap is still relatively small its 150 million daily user base pales in comparison to Facebooks 12 billion and its success is far from assured In its novelty it can sometimes veer toward the bizarre and inscrutable And its not obvious that all of its advances are positive For instance Im not sure that its always better for our relationships to lose a record of our chats with friendsYet its no wonder that Facebook and its subsidiaries appear obsessed with imitating Snap As a font of ideas that many in the tech industry hadnt considered before Snap isnt just popular but also increasingly importantRegardless of what happens theyve reshaped the social media landscape said Joseph B Bayer a communications professor at Ohio State University who has studied Snapchats impact on how people communicate Theyre making risky moves trying to rethink what people want online as opposed to taking whats already been done and adding a new flashTechies value disruption and its difficult to think of another online company that has shuffled the status quo as consistently as Snap has over the past few yearsBefore Snapchat the industry took for granted that everything users posted to the internet should remain there by default Saving peoples data  and then constantly reexamining it to create new products and advertising  is the engine that supports behemoths like Google and FacebookThe diminution of personalization algorithms and virality also plays into how Snapchat treats news Snapchats primary format is called a Story a slide show of a users video clips that are played in chronological order This too is an innovation before Snapchat much online content from blogs to tweets was consumed in reverse chronological order from the most recent to the oldest Snapchats Stories which have since been widely copied ushered in a more natural order  start at the beginning and go from thereA few years ago insiders at Snapchat noticed that Stories were an ideal vehicle for relaying news They could be crowdsourced If a lot of people were at a concert or sporting event or somewhere that breaking news was occurring a lot of them were likely to be snapping what was happening If Snapchat offered them a way to submit their clips it could spot the best ones and add them to a narrative compilation of the eventWhile Silicon Valley was shunning editing and curation done by humans and instead relying on computers to spot and disseminate news Snapchat began hiring producers and reporters to assemble clips into indepth piecesThe company calls these Live Stories and they have been transformative unlike any other news presentation you can find online Every day Snapchat offers one or several stories about big and small events happening in the world including football games awards shows and serious newsFor instance this summer while the rest of the media were engulfed by Hurricane Trump Snapchats news team spent days following the devastating floods in Louisiana That in itself was unusual but Snaps presentation was also groundbreaking Rather than showing the overhead shots or anchor standups that are conventional on TV news Snapchat offered video from inside peoples houses from shelters from schools It mixed the macrostory of an impending natural disaster and the governments response to it with the microtragedies of personal loss and even the lighter moments of humor and boredom in betweenSnapchat has said that it thinks of itself as a camera company rather than a social network This sounds like marketing puffery after all it only just started making its first actual camera Spectacles but I think its determination to set itself apart from the rest of the tech industry is important to noteSnap can free itself from Silicon Valleys accepted norms because it doesnt think of itself as just another Silicon Valley tech company Its time we all started to see it that way tooAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

82,AdvertisementSupported byTech Were UsingHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives Michael de la Merced a DealBook reporter for The Times based in London discussed the tech he is usingYou cover mergers and acquisitions Whats your favorite tech tool for doing your jobWhats so great about the iPhone XAs a gadget nerd I obviously find it satisfying to have the latest and greatest toy and its much faster than my old iPhone 6S with a better camera But to me its also a remarkable evolution of the smartphone where the technology seems to melt into the background a little bit more and it feels like youre just interacting directly with data photos movies and so onBut its all glass Do you fear breaking itOnly about every other minute I do keep it in a case Even though Id prefer to admire the design of the phone itself Id like to avoid shelling out hundreds of dollars in repairsAre there any special tools like websites filtering tools or apps that you use to stay on top of MA newsThere are specialized sites and tools like Standard  Poors Global Market Intelligence which once was called Capital IQ and a really pricey Bloomberg terminal

Francisco How do you use technology differently thereThats not a bad thingWhat tech trends do you see emerging in London or Europe in generalWhen youre not working what tech products are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life Whats so great and what could be betterNot a day goes by that I dont ask the household Amazon Echo something Alexa whats the forecast Then in a much more exasperated tone because the Echo willfully ignored my request Alexa whats the forecast Alexa I didnt ask for the weather in that town 20 miles away And so onIm also weighing getting a GPS tracker for my dog because a Im curious about how much she runs around on her daily walks with her dog walker and b Ive spent way too much time in San FranciscoIf I knew the answer to that that would probably

85,AdvertisementSupported byThe filmmaker Beth B was 13 in 1969 the year the fraught event occurred that would become a family secret That was when her mother Ida Horowitz checked herself into the mental ward of Mercy Hospital in San Diego Ida was then a Chevydriving mother of four and a struggling artist who kept a suicide contingency plan  a plastic bag just the right size to fit snugly over her head  at the bottom of her purseIncoherent Ida spent much of her six weeks at Mercy Hospital drawing what would become her salvation over 100 fantastical images in which abstract forms  some recognizable as Ida  collide float somersault and are engulfed by others an emotional reckoning in India ink watercolor and pastel Her daughter Beth struggled to understand the sudden disappearance of the mother she knewFive years later Ida Applebroog as she christened herself burst onto the New York art scene at the age of 45 eventually becoming a feminist boundarybreaker Her technical prowess as a painter has been accompanied by a fierce commitment to questioning business as usual the clichd concepts of female beauty and sexual pleasure the power dynamics between men and women the violence that percolates like bubbling lava through ordinary life Anchored in dark humor her work resides in the collections of the Whitney the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern ArtIts very difficult to see a film about yourself  plus by a daughter Ms Applebroog said on a recent morning wigs from one of her digital art projects poking out from the bookshelves I was positive it would be something that Beth would put out after Im gone It never occurred to me shed say Oh I finished the filmFor Beth  the B is a homage to Bmovies  the process has finally brought an appreciation for her own difficult history I think I spent a lot of my childhood protecting my mother she said sitting in a white room at the School of Visual Arts where she teaches The backdrop set off her vivid blue hairThe pair share many of the same preoccupations almost telepathically But Beth B had not seen the Mercy Hospital drawings until they looked at them together before the camera What a profound treasure she said It was like seeing the shell of who my mother was when I was 13 then looking at her today as this powerful strong artistAt one point Ms Applebroog asked to be involved in the editing hoping her daughter could omit material that made her uncomfortable After several sleepless nights Beth B said no I was interested in portraying Idas mind her passion and yes sometimes her insanity she explained I think thats what makes her such a fascinating artistI was there she added So I knew what happenedBeth Bs father Gideon Horowitz to whom the film is dedicated was a Vienneseborn psychotherapist who died of cancer last summer Ms Applebroog whose maiden name is Appelbaum met him when she was 15 and they were married for 60 years Both had lost family members in the Holocaust The artist grew up speaking Yiddish in an Orthodox household in a Bronx tenement I didnt have to wear a burqa but I had to follow the rules she said Which she did  usually I would sneak out to a luncheonette and order bacon sandwiches she recalled I should have been struck deadMs Applebroogs father was an imperious furrier who terrified the household And unlike her beloved older sister Frieda she was not a fighter Until recently when she became a geriatric as she puts it the artist was shy to the point of near paralysisTheres not a peaceful day as a child when you are shaking in your boots and afraid to enter the house she said Her mother who was illiterate was a crazed creative figure Ms Applebroog recalled who added fur accents to her daughters handsewn clothes Her mother would spend hours staring out the window Did I mention she was depressed Ms Applebroog inquiredAttuned to gender expectations early on Ms Applebroog recalled working for her father modeling fur coats for buyers Those sons of bitches would feel me up pretending to stroke the pelts she saidHer gift for drawing has always been effortless She compares the ease to making instant coffee She attended commercial art school and after moving to Chicago with her young family she made the bold decision to go back to school at the Art Institute a renegade move in an era when finding a balance between motherhood and being an artist was next to impossibleIn 1968 the family moved San Diego where Ms Applebroogs mental health began to unravel Like many women who had nipped their creative potential in the bud she felt trapped  like an empty house inhabited by hungry tenants she would writeThe film by Beth B takes a nuanced look at her mothers triumph over depression combining a daughters impressionistic images with her mothers journal entries to convey the depths of her harrowing descent It was triggered in part by Ms Applebroogs residual grief over Friedas death from rheumatic heart disease 20 years earlierIn a series of devastating poems called The Green Dress Ms Applebroog recalls the dress she wore the morning everything started to fall apart as she drove her two young sons to the zoo  unable to distinguish traffic lights and guided by two tiny voices in the back seat She committed herself to Mercy Hospital that dayBeth cried while editing passages from The Green Dress My mothers illness was hidden from us she said Depression was a taboo subject the siblings were told their mom had a bad back My most vivid memory is sitting by my mothers bedside trying to talk to her but not getting any response she added A great sadness was palpable but unexplainedWhen Ms Applebroog left the hospital for good she moved alone into an apartment Her priority became her art There was of course a sense of loss and confusion Beth B said My mother was searching for herself in a place that was foreign to me Yet on some deeper level she understood and supported her She too knew she wanted to be an artistWomens gender roles and the tipping points of power remain searing touchstones of Ms Applebroogs work Mona Lisa 2009 sketches of her vagina have the delicacy of Asian brush painting and Modern Olympia Scrolls 19972001 a fivepanel riff on Olympia douard Manets controversial nude celebrates womens freedom to revel in the pleasures of their bodiesAs a filmmaker Beths major challenge was to capture her mothers tenacity and fearlessness as an artist while persuading her to be open about her past At times tension crackles between the women Yet the painter knew that Beth Bs talent for revealing the melancholy truths beneath lifes placid veneer was learned at the foot of the masterMs Applebroogs increasing physical frailty is poignantly illustrated She no longer climbs ladders to paint relying on assistants to position the canvases Yet she continues to enthusiastically embrace new media and is steeping herself in taxidermy for her current project  an Applebroogian twist on John James Audubons Birds of America series to be called Angry Birds of America She is poring over taxidermy catalogs full of long needles and other tools I havent told anybody because it would be

86,AdvertisementSupported byThe plaintiffs have accused Arab Bank of providing services to terrorists responsible for the attacks The bank asked the Supreme Court to intervene and reverse an unusual ruling that will affect a coming trial in Federal District Court in BrooklynMr Verrillis brief spends 14 pages arguing that lower court rulings against the bank erred in several significant respects and overlooked vital American foreign policy interests Nevertheless the brief concludes with three pages arguing that the Supreme Court should not intervene because the problems can be reviewed later if the bank losesIts very schizophrenic said Mark S Werbner the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs Obviously the government is trying to have it both waysThe lawsuit Arab Bank v Linde which was filed a decade ago accuses Arab Bank of providing services to terrorists responsible for killing 39 Americans and injuring 102 during the second intifada The bank contends that it did not knowingly do business with terroristsThe crux of the dispute involves a judges decision to penalize the bank for refusing to turn over financial records as potential evidence The bank said that doing so would be a crime under Lebanese Jordanian and Palestinian Authority banking secrecy lawsIn 2010 a trial judge in Brooklyn said jurors would be instructed that they could infer that the bank knowingly and purposefully provided banking services to terrorists and the bank would be barred from citing the foreign bank secrecy laws in its defenseThe bank appealed saying that undergoing a trial under the sanctions order would be unfair and damaging But a federal appeals court declined to interveneFor the Obama administration the dispute raised thorny legal and policy tradeoffs involving an unusual constellation of issues including diplomatic efforts to stabilize the Middle East the rights of American victims of terrorism and an otherwise unrelated effort by the United States to tear down Swiss bank secrecy laws that have long aided tax evasionIf the Supreme Court decides not to hear the appeal the trial is scheduled to begin Aug 11AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY

87,AdvertisementSupported byThe preparations  described by top aides as businesslike  are part of a deliberate White House strategy to ignore the fact that Republicans have refused to even consider his nomination Mr Obamas aides and Judge Garlands allies have concluded that acting as if the Supreme Court nomination is going ahead is the best way to maximize pressure on their adversariesThat means maintaining a brisk schedule of oneonone courtesy meetings with senators for the next month a period that White House officials consider phase one This week Judge Garland will meet privately with two Republican senators and on Thursday Mr Obama will travel to the University of Chicago where he taught constitutional law to press for more Republicans to meet with his nomineeAlso this week liberal groups are flying in about 40 constituents of Republican senators from Iowa Nevada New Hampshire Pennsylvania Ohio and Wisconsin to lobby their lawmakers and hold a news conference on Capitol Hill The Republican constituents include two former staff members of Senator Charles E Grassley of Iowa the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee who would oversee confirmation hearings if they ever took placeWhite House officials say they remain optimistic Despite initial reports that Republican senators were united in their opposition to even talking to Judge Garland 16 Republican senators have said they are willing to at least meet with him in person Mr Obamas advisers and his allies on Capitol Hill view that as an early victoryThey also point to polling that suggests that the majority of the population believes that Republicans should treat Mr Obamas nominee as the way they have previous court picks  with a hearing and a voteThe judges courtesy calls this month will be followed by phase two when he will fill out a version of the extensive legal questionnaire that has become routine in Supreme Court confirmations The White House plans to submit the questionnaire to the Judiciary Committee even if Mr Grassley and the committees Republicans do not ask for oneMr Obama will spend the late spring and summer daring Republicans in speeches interviews and other public events to block a hearing aides said If Republicans relent and hold a hearing phase three will be an allout public relations campaign aimed at demanding a final upordown vote on Judge GarlandThe ones who are not meeting with him are going to be a smaller and smaller number said Neil Eggleston the White House counsel who has been gaming out the moves and countermoves I think its going to be harder and harder for them not to accord the basic fairness first of a meeting and second of a hearingIn part that assessment relies on the belief that Judge Garlands record offers no ideological targets that Republicans could use to distract from the Democrats demands for a fair process He does not have grand statements of policy or things like that in his opinions Mr Eggleston said Its a classic judges craftBut on Saturday two Republican senators Jerry Moran of Kansas and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska revoked their support for confirmation hearings saying they oppose Judge Garlands nomination and saw no need for the process to continueAnd Republicans are building a powerful opposition by lobbying Republican senators and rallying important interest groups Carrie Severino the chief counsel and policy director for the Judicial Crisis Network which is working against Judge Garlands confirmation said in a statement on Friday that she was confident that even the Republican senators who met with Judge Garland would never agree to hold a hearing or vote to put him on the Supreme CourtThe White Houses attempt to manufacture Republican disunity is engaging in wishful thinking and confusing courtesy with weakness Ms Severino saidWhite House officials acknowledge that if the months pass with no movement from Republicans it might be difficult to keep the publics attention focused on Judge Garlands nomination particularly in the midst of the circuslike atmosphere of the presidential campaignBut the Supreme Court strategists inside the West Wing said they expected to get a lift in attention from the court itself which will issue important decisions on abortion affirmative action and health care by the end of June Those decisions will highlight the need to confirm Judge Garland they insistedIf the court splits 4 to 4 on some of those cases the president and his team will be able to use the legal stalemate to press Republicans to relent One adviser said the image of a court with a structural institutional problem would help the White House make its caseThe group of presidential aides and lawyers helping to prepare Judge Garland for his Capitol Hill courtesy visits includes Brian Deese a senior Obama adviser who manages the study sessions Eric Schultz the deputy White House press secretary and Susan Davies a former White House deputy counsel who led the confirmation process for Justice Elena Kagan in 2010An outside group is also helping to advise the administration but is not part of the sessions with Judge Garland Among its members are Ron Klain a former chief of staff to Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr Karen Dunn a lawyer at Boies Schiller  Flexner and a former clerk for Judge Garland and Cynthia Hogan the National Football Leagues top lobbyist who was chief counsel on the Judiciary Committee when Mr Biden was its chairmanFor now the group has decided to follow the process that worked in previous confirmation fights In recent weeks Judge Garland has played the part of the conventional Supreme Court nominee remaining silent as he walked past rows of reporters During this time he has recused himself from cases on the appeals court but has continued to carry out administrative dutiesWhite House officials will not say if they might one day break with tradition by letting Judge Garland do interviews or give speechesThe officials are also counting on the Constitutional Responsibility Project run by former Obama officials and the myriad liberal groups that have made it their mission to help Judge Garland win confirmationThe groups have generated hundreds of editorials in newspapers calling on Republican senators to give the nominee a fair look They have sent representatives to speak up for Judge Garland at townhallstyle meetings around the country Some groups have begun targeted advertising calling for senators to do their job and give the judge a hearingWe just got started said Brad Woodhouse the president of

88,AdvertisementSupported byThe president repeatedly said that the raids were part of a witch hunt against him that has been conducted since he took office and he mused about the possibility that he might soon fire Robert S Mueller III the special counsel in the Russia inquiryWell see what may happen Mr Trump said as he began a meeting with senior military officials to discuss responses to a chemical attack in Syria Many people have said You should fire himThe president railed against Jeff Sessions the attorney general for recusing himself in the Russia investigation and he blasted the FBI for failing to investigate Hillary Clinton where there are crimes He also lashed out at Rod J Rosenstein the deputy attorney general who is overseeing the Russia investigationMr Trump delivered the emotional tirade hours after federal officials raided Mr Cohens office and hotel room seizing business records emails and documents including information related to a payment that Mr Cohen made to a pornographic film actressThe raids were in part the result of a referral to federal officials by Mr Mueller Mr Trump called Mr Muellers team the most biased group of people and said that it contained mostly Democrats and some Republicans who worked for President Barack ObamaThat is really now in a whole new level of unfairness Mr Trump said of the raids involving Mr Cohen Officials said the White House learned about the raids from Mr Cohens lawyer after they were carried out but before they became public knowledgeBut the aggressive move by federal officials against Mr Cohen the presidents longtime personal lawyer appeared to strike a particularly sensitive nerve Mr Cohen who works for Mr Trumps private company has long been considered one of the presidents closest business confidantsMr Trump reacted to the raids without any prompting from reporters who had been brought into the Cabinet Room where the president was meeting with Jim Mattis the secretary of defense John R Bolton the new national security adviser and other military officials to discuss the situation in Syria As the cameras began rolling Mr Trump immediately condemned the actions against Mr CohenSo I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys a good man and its a disgraceful situation he said Its a total witch hunt Ive been saying it for a long time Ive wanted to keep it downIt was unclear what Mr Trump meant by saying he wanted to keep it down He went on to criticize Mr Muellers team for examining the presidents associatesThey only keep looking at us So they find no collusion and then they go from there and they say Well lets keep going and they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning and I think its a disgrace Mr Trump saidHe criticized Mr Rosenstein for having signed a FISA warrant apparently a reference to the role Mr Rosenstein played in authorizing the wiretap of a Trump associate in the Russia inquiry Republicans have been highly critical of the warrant saying the FBI persuaded judges to authorize it on false pretensesThe presidents suggestion that he might fire Mr Mueller drew swift condemnations from Capitol Hill where Democrats and Republicans alike have warned that doing so would cross a dangerous political and legal lineIf the president is thinking of using this raid to fire Special Counsel Mueller or otherwise interfere with the chain of command in the Russia probe we Democrats have one simple message for him Dont said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the Democratic leaderSpecial Counsel Mueller a Republican has uncovered a deep and detailed pattern of Russian interference in our elections that has led to indictments and guilty pleas Mr Schumer added It has also led to the Trump administration itself leveling sanctions against Russian individuals for meddling in our elections proof that its not a socalled witch huntThomas Kaplan and Eileen Sullivan contributed

89,AdvertisementSupported byThe search warrant carried out by the public corruption unit of the United States attorneys office in Manhattan sought information about Karen McDougal a former Playboy model who claims she carried on a nearly yearlong affair with Mr Trump shortly after the birth of his youngest son in 2006 Ms McDougal was paid 150000 by American Media Inc The Enquirers parent company whose chief executive is a friend of Mr TrumpsStephen Ryan Mr Cohens lawyer said that it was Mr Mueller who referred evidence to the federal authorities in New York who carried out Mondays raids In an email on Tuesday Mr Ryan repeated his assertion that the raids were inappropriate and unnecessaryMr Trump has been dogged for months by accusations that women with whom he is said to have had affairs were paid to keep quiet before the election  charges that the White House has repeatedly said he deniesMs McDougal has claimed that she had a 10month consensual affair with Mr Trump 12 years ago American Media which is owned by David J Pecker agreed to pay Ms McDougal 150000 for the rights to her story in August 2016 but did not publish it in a practice known as catch and kill Ms Clifford who told her story about an affair with Mr Trump to CBSs 60 Minutes last month is aggressively challenging the nondisclosure agreement she agreed to in October 2016 receiving 130000 in returnIt is unclear exactly why the New York investigators are examining the payments But critics of the president have claimed that they amount to illegal campaign contributions because they helped Mr Trump win the White House by suppressing politically damaging storiesThe FBI also searched for records related to Mr Cohens New York taxicab business apparently a separate line of inquiry unrelated to Mr Trump Mr Cohen is a longtime owner of taxi medallions at one point operating a fleet of more than 200 cabs in ManhattanBesides enraging Mr Trump the earlymorning searches associates said also led him to privately wonder whether he should fire Rod J Rosenstein the veteran prosecutor appointed by Mr Trump to serve as deputy attorney general Mr Rosenstein personally signed off on Mondays FBI decision to raid the office of Mr Cohen several government officials saidJustice Department regulations require prosecutors to consult with senior officials in Washington but not necessarily the deputy attorney general before conducting a search of a lawyers files which is among the most delicate steps federal prosecutors can take in an investigationAs Mr Trump has stewed over the developments he has cast blame in many directions Privately people close to the president said he has blamed Mr Cohen for acknowledging the payments to Ms CliffordOn Monday evening Mr Trump called the courtauthorized raids an attack on our country  unusually harsh language that he has not used to describe Russias attempts to influence an American election through hacking and propaganda  and the raids are likely to complicate Mr Trumps negotiations with Mr Mueller over the terms of a possible interviewMr Trumps lawyers have warned that such an interview would be incredibly risky but Mr Trump had been confident in his ability and was eager to sit for one People close to the president said the raids could change that thinkingThe presidents reaction has deeply unsettled aides current and former Justice Department officials and lawmakers from both parties who believe the president may use the raids as a pretext to purge the team leading the Russia investigationNow is the time for officials in the executive branch and Congress who care about the rule of law to counsel against any effort to undermine the special counsels work said David Laufman a former top Justice Department official who oversaw the Russia investigation before Mr Muellers appointmentAdding to the concern among Mr Trumps aides about his mood is the release next week of a book by James B Comey the former FBI director which is expected to be sharply critical of the presidentThe involvement of Mr Rosenstein and top prosecutors in New York in the raids of Mr Cohens office and hotel room makes it harder for Mr Trump to argue that his legal problems are the result of a witch hunt led by Mr Mueller In addition to Mr Rosenstein all of the top law enforcement officials involved in the raids are Republicans including Mr Mueller and Christopher A Wray Mr Trumps choice to succeed Mr Comey as director of the FBIGeoffrey Berman the interim United States attorney for Southern District of New York which oversaw the raids has been recused from the case according to one person with knowledge with the matter The precise reason was not clear but under Justice Department guidelines a United States attorney must report any issue that could require recusal as a result of an actual or apparent conflict of interestMr Berman who worked as a volunteer lawyer on Mr Trumps campaign was the choice of Donald F McGahn II the White House counsel to be the United States attorney in New York according to a person with direct knowledge of the appointmentWhile Mr Trump is focused for the moment on Mr Rosenstein many of the presidents advisers and allies are fearful that the president also intends to fire Mr Mueller in an attempt to end the Russia investigation Asked by reporters on Monday night whether he intends to do so Mr Trump said Well see what happensDespite Tuesdays assertions by Ms Sanders many legal experts believe the president cannot fire Mr Mueller himself and would have to direct Mr Rosenstein to do so Mr Rosenstein has told Congress that he would dismiss Mr Mueller only for cause and people close to Mr Rosenstein have indicated that he would resign if he were ordered to fire Mr Mueller by the presidentBipartisan legislation has been introduced to protect Mr Mueller with senators urging Mr Trump to let the inquiry go forward without impediment Republican leadership has dismissed such legislation as unnecessaryThe prospect that Mr Trump might still find a way to fire Mr Mueller elicited angry responses from Congressional Democrats and some Republicans who warned that such a move would be disastrous for the White HouseSenator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said Tuesday on Fox Business Network that it would be suicide for the president to want to talk about firing MuellerOn Monday Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the House Democratic leader called Mr Trumps attacks on Mr Mueller and his team a grave reminder of his utter contempt for the rule of law Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the Senates top Democrat urged the president Dont do it do not go down this path For the sake of our country

90,AdvertisementSupported byThis instinct to humiliate when its modeled by someone in the public platform by someone powerful it filters down into everybodys life because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing she said Disrespect invites disrespect violence incites violence And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all loseHere is Ms Streeps speechPlease sit down Thank you I love you all Youll have to forgive me Ive lost my voice in screaming and lamentation this weekend And I have lost my mind sometime earlier this year so I have to readThank you Hollywood Foreign Press Just to pick up on what Hugh Laurie said You and all of us in this room really belong to the most vilified segments in American society right now Think about it Hollywood foreigners and the pressBut who are we and what is Hollywood anyway Its just a bunch of people from other places I was born and raised and educated in the public schools of New Jersey Viola was born in a sharecroppers cabin in South Carolina came up in Central Falls Rhode Island Sarah Paulson was born in Florida raised by a single mom in Brooklyn Sarah Jessica Parker was one of seven or eight kids in Ohio Amy Adams was born in Vicenza Italy And Natalie Portman was born in Jerusalem Where are their birth certificates And the beautiful Ruth Negga was born in Addis Ababa Ethiopia raised in London  no in Ireland I do believe and shes here nominated for playing a girl in smalltown VirginiaRyan Gosling like all of the nicest people is Canadian and Dev Patel was born in Kenya raised in London and is here playing an Indian raised in Tasmania So Hollywood is crawling with outsiders and foreigners And if we kick them all out youll have nothing to watch but football and mixed martial arts which are not the artsThey gave me three seconds to say this so An actors only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like And there were many many many powerful performances this year that did exactly that Breathtaking compassionate workBut there was one performance this year that stunned me It sank its hooks in my heart Not because it was good there was nothing good about it But it was effective and it did its job It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter Someone he outranked in privilege power and the capacity to fight back It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still cant get it out of my head because it wasnt in a movie It was real life And this instinct to humiliate when its modeled by someone in the public platform by someone powerful it filters down into everybodys life because it kinda gives permission for other people to do the same thing Disrespect invites disrespect violence incites violence And when the powerful use their position to bully others we all lose OK go on with itOK this brings me to the press We need the principled press to hold power to account to call him on the carpet for every outrage Thats why our founders enshrined the press and its freedoms in the Constitution So I only ask the famously wellheeled Hollywood Foreign Press and all of us in our community to join me in supporting the Committee to Protect Journalists because were gonna need them going forward and theyll need us to safeguard the truthOne more thing Once when I was standing around on the set one day whining about something  you know we were gonna work through supper or the long hours or whatever Tommy Lee Jones said to me Isnt it such a privilege Meryl just to be an actor Yeah it is and we have to remind each other of the privilege and the responsibility of the act of empathy We should all be proud of the work Hollywood honors here tonightAs my friend the dear departed Princess Leia said to me once take your broken heart make it into artAnd here is Ms Daviss introduction for Ms StreepShe stares Thats the first thing you notice about her She tilts her head back with that sly suspicious smile and she stares for a long time And you think Do I have something in my teeth Or does she wanna kick my expletive  which is not gonna happenAnd then shell ask questions Whatd you do last night ViolaOh I cooked an apple pieDid you use Pippin applesPippin apples what the hell are Pippin apples I used Granny Smith applesOh Did you make your own crustNo I used storebought crust Thats what I didThen you didnt make an apple pie ViolaWell thats because I spent all my time making my collard greens I make the best collard greens I use smokedturkey chicken broth and my own special sauceSilence I shut her downWell they dont taste right unless you use ham hocks If you dont use ham hocks it doesnt taste the same So hows the familyAnd as she continues to stare you realize that she sees you And like a highpowered scanning machine shes recording you She is an observer and a thief She waits to share what she has stolen on that sacred place which is the screen She makes the most heroic characters vulnerable the most known familiar the most despised relatable Dame Streep Her artistry reminds us of the impact of what it means to be an artist which is to make us feel less alone I can only imagine where you go Meryl when you disappear into a character I imagine that youre in them patiently waiting using yourself as a conduit encouraging them coaxing them to release all their mess expose to live You are a muse Your impact encouraged me to stay in the lineDame Streep I see you I see you And you know all those rainy days we spent on the set of Doubt Every day my husband would call me at night and say Did you tell her how much she means to youAnd I said No I cant say anything Julius Im just nervous All I do is stare at her all the timeHe said Well you need to say something Youve been waiting all your life to work with this woman Say somethingI said Julius Ill do it tomorrowOK you better do it tomorrow because when I get there Im going to say somethingI havent said anything But Im gonna say it now You make me proud to be an artist You make me feel that what I have in me my body my face my age is enough You encapsulate that great mile Zola quote that if you ask me as an artist what I came into this world to do I an artist would say I came to live out

91,AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  For Hillary Clinton the sudden fall of James B Comey is wrapped in multiple layers of ironyMrs Clinton blames Mr Comey for tilting the presidential election against her in the closing days of last years campaign by announcing that the FBI might reopen its investigation of her email practices while she was at the State DepartmentYet her satisfaction at seeing him lose his job friends said is offset by worries that it could derail the FBIs investigation of ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officialsMrs Clinton these people said puts no stock in President Trumps stated rationale for dismissing Mr Comey as the FBI director  that he mishandled the bureaus investigation of her email case  even though she fundamentally agrees with that damning assessmentOne person who spoke with Mrs Clinton after the White Houses announcement said she has a mixed mind about his firing While Mrs Clinton believes that Mr Comey interfered with the election this person said taking him out of his job at this point only reinforces the point that he was on to somethingMrs Clinton has said nothing publicly about the FBI directors dismissal In her most recent Twitter post on May 7 she celebrated the victory of Emmanuel Macron in Frances presidential election which she said was a defeat to those interfering wdemocracyTop officials from her campaign said there was no joy in Hillaryland at Mr Trumps startling decision They worry that the president will nominate a more pliable figure than Mr Comey to run the FBI that Mr Trump will be able to muscle that person through a Republicancontrolled Senate which needs only 51 votes to confirm the nominee and that the new FBI director may not pursue the evidence in the Russian investigation as aggressively as Mr Comey didThere is no one I have encountered in Clintonworld who views this as a positive development said Jennifer Palmieri the campaigns former communications director When I heard the news my first thought was They must be getting closeOne potential benefit she said is that the furor surrounding Mr Comeys ouster may put a greater spotlight on Russias meddling in the election The Clinton campaign struggled before the election to generate interest in Russias role beyond core Democrats Ms Palmieri saidHow big a role Mr Comey played in Mrs Clintons defeat is a subject of debate even within her inner circle In the immediate aftermath of the vote she told donors Our analysis is that Comeys letter raising doubts that were groundless baseless proven to be stopped our momentum She has continued to emphasize the FBIs role Her friends say she believes that but for Mr Comey and the Russians she would be presidentIn a recent interview Mrs Clinton was asked how she felt when watching Mr Comey tell Congress he believed it was inappropriate before the election to disclose the FBIs investigation of the Trump campaigns ties to Russia which began in July She responded dryly That was one of the high points of the last weeksOther officials however said the FBI intervention was one of a torrent of negative developments for the Democratic campaign including the release of campaign emails by WikiLeaks that sapped its momentum in the weeks after the third debate between Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump We had a lot coming at us and it was one too many things Ms Palmieri saidIn recent conversations Democratic officials have faulted the Clinton campaigns message and her use of a private email server as secretary of state They have also cited structural impediments like gender bias and Mrs Clintons identity as an establishment figure in a change electionWhatever the other factors Mr Comey has become a singularly baleful figure to people who worked on her campaignWhen Mr Comey testified last week that he felt mildly nauseous at the idea that he might have swayed the election John D Podesta who was the campaigns chairman wrote on Twitter The American public is getting mildly nauseous listening to Jim ComeyJake Sullivan who was Mrs Clintons senior policy adviser said he was still assessing the implications of Mr Comeys dismissal Most see it as a transparent abuse of power he said Im not sure what to make of it or what its implications will beAs news of Mr Comeys dismissal spread other veterans of the campaign reacted on social media with a mix of lingering bitterness about the email case and foreboding about the futureTwilight zone Robby Mook the former campaign manager said on Twitter I was as disappointed and frustrated as anyone at how the email investigation was handled But this terrifies meBrian Fallon a campaign spokesman wrote on Twitter early Wednesday The descent into authoritarianism does not announce itself with the blaring of

92,AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  Investigators working for the special counsel Robert S Mueller III recently asked the White House for documents related to the former national security adviser Michael T Flynn and have questioned witnesses about whether he was secretly paid by the Turkish government during the final months of the presidential campaign according to people close to the investigationThough not a formal subpoena the document request is the first known instance of Mr Muellers team asking the White House to hand over recordsIn interviews with potential witnesses in recent weeks prosecutors and FBI agents have spent hours poring over the details of Mr Flynns business dealings with a TurkishAmerican businessman who worked last year with Mr Flynn and his consulting business the Flynn Intel GroupThe company was paid 530000 to run a campaign to discredit an opponent of the Turkish government who has been accused of orchestrating last years failed coup in the countryInvestigators want to know if the Turkish government was behind those payments  and if the Flynn Intel Group made kickbacks to the businessman Ekim Alptekin for helping conceal the source of the moneyThe line of questioning shows that Mr Muellers inquiry has expanded into a fullfledged examination of Mr Flynns financial dealings beyond the relatively narrow question of whether he failed to register as a foreign agent or lied about his conversations and business arrangements with Russian officialsPresident Trump has publicly said Mr Mueller should confine his investigation to the narrow issue of Russias attempts to disrupt last years presidential campaign not conduct an expansive inquiry into the finances of Mr Trump or his associatesMr Flynn declined to comment Ty Cobb special counsel to Mr Trump said Weve said before were collaborating with the special counsel on an ongoing basisIts full cooperation mode as far as we are concerned he saidInvestigators are also examining the flow of money into and out of the Flynn Intel Group  a consulting firm Mr Flynn founded after being forced out as the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency  according to several potential witnesses who have been interviewed by prosecutors and FBI agentsTaking money from Turkey or any foreign government is not illegal But failing to register as a foreign agent is a felony and trying to hide the source of the money by routing it through a private company or some other entity and then paying kickbacks to the middleman could lead to numerous criminal charges including fraudMr Flynn has now had to file three versions of his financialdisclosure forms His first version did not disclose payments from Russialinked companies He added those payments to an amended version of the forms he submitted in March This week he filed a new version adding that he briefly had a contract with SCL Group the parent company of Cambridge Analytica a datamining firm that worked with the Trump campaignThe new forms list at least 18 million in income up from roughly the 14 million he had previously reported It is unclear how much of that money was related to work Mr Flynn did on Turkey issuesMr Flynns campaign to discredit the opponent of the Turkish government Fethullah Gulen began on Aug 9 when his firm signed a 600000 deal with Inovo BV a Dutch company owned by Mr Alptekin the TurkishAmerican businessmanMr Gulen a reclusive cleric lives in rural PennsylvaniaThe contract with Mr Alptekin was brought in by Bijan R Kian an IranianAmerican businessman who was one of Mr Flynns business partners Mr Kian who served until 2011 as a director of the ExportImport Bank a United States federal agency is also under scrutiny according to witnesses questioned by Mr Muellers investigators A lawyer for Mr Kian declined to commentMr Muellers investigators have asked repeatedly about two payments of 40000 each that the Flynn Intel Group made to Inovo said witnesses who have been interviewed in the caseThe investigators have indicated that they suspect that the payments were kickbacks and in one interview pointed to the suspicious timing of the transfers The first payment back to Inovo was made on Sept 13 four days after the Dutch company made its first payout under the contract sending 200000 to the Flynn Intel GroupOn Oct 11 Inovo paid the Flynn Intel Group an additional 185000 Then six days later the Flynn Intel Group sent 40000 to InovoMr Alptekin said that both payments were refunds for work that the Flynn Intel Group had not completedEkim maintains that all payments and refunds were for unfulfilled work and that they were legal ethical and above board said Molly Toomey a spokeswoman for Mr Alptekin She described the reimbursements as a business decisionLike many Americans rolling up their sleeves in 911 to do something I decided to do something Mr Alptekin saidHe scoffed at the suggestion that he was a front for the Turkish government Inovo he noted was registered in the Netherlands where it is difficult to mask the ownership of a company A clear paper trail linked the payments between his company and the Flynn Intel Group he saidIf we were trying to hide he said youd think wed be good at itAdam Goldman contributed reportingAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS,election,"['advertisementsupported', 'bywashington', 'investigators',

93,AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  On the 140th day of the Trump presidency  one for each allotted character on the executive Twitter feed that stayed conspicuously silent all Thursday morning  a very tall man with a very strange place in this very bewildering moment in American history strolled into Hart Senate Office Building 216 shot a quick glance at the masses arrayed behind him and presented a seenitall city with something unusualFor about two and a half hours the room fell into an anxious hush punctured sporadically by audible emissions of surprise at the remarks of a deposed FBI director with a collection of Trumpbranded knives in his reputational torsoSenators settled into their telegenic gazes steely but approachable often whispering to one another as the witness held forthPhotographers clicked with impunity descending on every twitch a wave of the hand a cock of the head a woman delivering glasses of ice water to Mr Comeys table before he arrivedAnd the headliner summoned a theatrical swagger to match the moment assuming a role with little precedent a dispatched federal employee  hero villain Shakespearean character in the 2016 election and early Trump administration  staring into the cameras and talking to the president who had fired himSo much about the Trump era has scrambled Washingtons sense of itself as promised In the haze it can be difficult to tease out which baffling elements arrived with this president and which were preexisting conditions already endemic to an industry town with a Trumpian selfobsession long before he moved inInside the room on Thursday these dual forces seemed to hurtle into each other fusing in real time Echoes of scandals past  Irancontra Anita Hill Monica Lewinsky  wafted overhead visiting the memories of Senate veteransA modest walk away the proceedings were aired above the bar at the Trump International HotelAt the Capitol attendees took stock of the ubiquity and wondered A Trump supporter Patrick Wells 49 who had traveled from Massachusetts to support the president marveled that the hearing had knocked The Price Is Right from its broadcast perch They usually only do that if its an assassination or a terrorist attack he saidMr Wells eyed the slithering line for public admission warily before resigning himself to an overflow roomEven the lawmakers seemed taken by the spectacleWest Virginia is very interested in this hearing that were having today the states Democratic senator Joe Manchin III said dryly at one pointWest Virginia had companyRestaurants opened early for the main event with Russian vodka specials on offer Taxis swore off smooth jazz and Top 40 for audio feeds from the Senate Intelligence CommitteeOff camera wandering senators often loath to endure full hearings for even their own committees slipped into the room to watch their colleagues workFor much of the morning boldfaced names dotted the crowd at least by Capitol standards spawning the sort of dialogue that might translate poorly in most corners of the countryMostly though attention rarely strayed from the witness chair where Mr Comey held his audience with an uncommon skill set for a veteran law enforcement official a novelists instinct for narrative and occasionally levityHe likened reporters to sea gulls on the beach He used fuzz as a hardtotrack metaphor and quoted Englands Henry IIHe defended his credentials as a reader of people with Ive had a lot of conversations with humans over the yearsAnd he appeared inclined to win support among viewers inside the building and out with an implicit contrast in style to Mr Trump reaching often for notes of humilitySlightly cowardly he said of his own behavior in one interaction with Mr TrumpI dont want to make you  sound like Im Captain Courageous he mustered laterWhen Senator Kamala Harris Democrat of California thanked him for coming Mr Comey reminded her that his employment status had opened up his calendar Im between opportunities now he saidOthers on hand arrived without a formal invitationJoe Noser 19 had camped out overnight at the Capitol to secure a prime spot in line He invoked the Lewinsky affair from the late 1990s the period of his birthIts not a sex scandal but its still important he said of Thursdays events It will be the coolest thing to tell your grandkids down the road I was able to see the Comey hearingNearby Victoria Herring 20 who also stayed at the Capitol on Wednesday night to reach the room before dawn waited among the congressional pilgrimsThe line stretched down hallways and around corners Most people would never even sniff the room Perhaps Ms Herring suggested Mr Trump would appreciate the sceneHe loves drama she saidAnd he loves a show with big ratings or used

95,AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  President Trump rejected for now at least a fresh round of sanctions set to be imposed against Russia on Monday a course change that underscored the schism between the president and his national security teamThe presidents ambassador to the United Nations Nikki R Haley had announced on Sunday that the administration would place sanctions on Russian companies found to be assisting Syrias chemical weapons program The sanctions were listed on a menu of further government options after an Americanled airstrike on Syria retaliating against a suspected gas attack that killed dozens a week earlierBut the White House contradicted her on Monday saying that Mr Trump had not approved additional measuresWe are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary said in a statementSpeaking later with reporters aboard Air Force One as Mr Trump headed to Florida Ms Sanders added that the president has been clear that hes going to be tough on Russia but at the same time hed still like to have a good relationship with themAnother White House official who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations said Mr Trump had decided not to go forward with the sanctions Mr Trump concluded that they were unnecessary because Moscows response to the airstrike was mainly bluster the official saidRussia analysts said the whipsaw policy shift once again highlighted an administration struggling to find a coherent and consistent voice in dealing with Russia which in the past four years has annexed Crimea intervened in eastern Ukraine sought to influence the American election in 2016 allegedly poisoned a former Russian spy living in Britain and propped up the murderous government of President Bashar alAssad in SyriaTrump seems to think that if he accepts what his advisers recommend on even days of the month and rejects their recommendations on odd days the result will be a strategy said Stephen Sestanovich a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations and Columbia University who served as ambassador to former Soviet states in the 1990sBy and large other governments dont know whether to laugh or cry at all this Mr Sestanovich said But in Russia laughter is getting the upper handMr Trump was annoyed with Ms Haley for getting out in front of the policy the administration official said and the presidents decision to reject sanctions left her hanging in public with her credibility on the lineMs Haley has been one of the strongest critics in the administration of Russias behavior around the world often speaking far more harshly than Mr Trump would but she has rarely been reined in publicly this way She made no comment on MondayAdministration officials said new sanctions could still be imposed at some point if Russia takes further action justifying themBut absent such a scenario the officials could not explain how Mr Trump would make Russia pay a big price for enabling Syrias use of chemical weapons as he promised to do last week after a suspected gas attack killed more than 40 people and sickened scores more outside Damascus on April 7The strike against Syria that Mr Trump announced late Friday in Washington was limited to a single night and to three targets linked to chemical weapons facilities It sought to punish President Bashar alAssad of Syria for the suspected gas attack but avoid provoking Russia into a responseRussian forces stationed in Syria have helped Mr Assad gain the upper hand in the countrys sevenyear civil warRussia responded harshly to the news of sanctions before learning that Mr Trump had canceled them The sanctions drive against Russia is becoming an obsession Dmitri S Peskov the Kremlin spokesman told reporters at his daily briefing in Moscow Were convinced that any economist can see open attempts to squeeze Russian companies out of global marketsCritics said the presidents decision not to follow through on Ms Haleys announcement would sap American authority around the worldI am outraged that President Trump pulled back sanctions on Russia for its support of the Assad regime said Representative Eliot L Engel of New York the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee This sends a message to governments around the world that they can support brutal criminal behavior without serious consequencesPresident Trump is out of step with the American people American values  and as this situation has made clear his own administration Mr Engel saidThe aboutface on sanctions came a day after ABC News broadcast an interview with James B Comey the former FBI director fired by Mr Trump last year in which he said he thought its possible that the president had been compromised by Russia A protester waiting for Mr Trump in Florida on Monday held a large banner that read Russian stoogeMr Trump has heatedly and repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia during his 2016 campaign calling such suggestions a hoax perpetrated by Democratic sore losers desperate to explain an election defeatRussia did not respond militarily to the Friday strike but American officials noted a sharp spike in Russian online activity around the time it was launchedA snapshot on Friday night recorded a 2000 percent increase in citing the hashtag isupportsyria on Russian troll networks according to a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security who was not authorized to discuss the issue by name and spoke on condition of anonymity Additionally the official said the known Russian hashtag SyriaStrikes had a 4443 percent increase in activity while another Damsucs saw a 2800 percent jumpIn hitting the Barzah Research and Development Center a chemical weapons research lab in greater Damascus and two storage facilities and bunkers near Homs Pentagon officials insisted that they dealt a critical blow to Mr Assads weapons program But Friday nights strike delivered via 105 missiles was not quite double the 59 missiles used last year when Mr Trump ordered the military to strike a Syrian airfield from which planes engaged in another chemical weapons attack took offDefense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed hard to limit the strikes to proven weapons facilities in the hopes that a more limited strike would not prompt retaliation from RussiaThe lab at Barzah in Damascus was on the receiving end of the biggest barrage  some 76 missiles a combination of Tomahawk cruise missiles and Joint airtosurface missiles The rest of the bombs  29 fired by American French and British warplanes  struck and destroyed the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility near Homs and the Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker facility around five miles awaySyria tried to hit back but by the time its air defense system was deployed the American warplanes were on their way home and the war ships had completed their mission military officials said They disputed Syrian claims to have shot down dozens of American missilesWe assess that over 40 surfacetoair missiles were employed by the Syrian regime Lt Gen Kenneth F McKenzie director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon told reporters on Saturday Most of these launches occurred after the last impact of our strike was overHe called the Syrian retaliatory missiles largely ineffective and said they clearly increased risk to their own people based on their indiscriminate response  when you shoot iron into the sky without guidance it will inevitably fall to

96,AdvertisementSupported byWASHINGTON  When the Obama administration imposed sanctions on individual Russians last month in response to Moscows armed intervention in Ukraine one of the targets was a longtime partowner of a commodities trading company called the Gunvor GroupHis name Gennady N Timchenko meant little to most Americans but buried in the Treasury Department announcement were a dozen words that President Obama and his team knew would not escape the attention of Russias president Vladimir V Putin Putin the statement said has investments in Gunvor and may have access to Gunvor fundsFor years the suspicion that Mr Putin has a secret fortune has intrigued scholars industry analysts opposition figures journalists and intelligence agencies but defied their efforts to uncover it Numbers are thrown around suggesting that Mr Putin may control 40 billion or even 70 billion in theory making him the richest head of state in world historyFor all the rumors and speculation though there has been little if any hard evidence and Gunvor has adamantly denied any financial ties to Mr Putin and repeated that denial on FridayBut Mr Obamas response to the Ukraine crisis while derided by critics as slow and weak has reinvigorated a 15year global hunt for Mr Putins hidden wealthNow as the Obama administration prepares to announce another round of sanctions as early as Monday targeting Russians it considers part of Mr Putins financial circle it is sending a notverysubtle message that it thinks it knows where the Russian leader has his money and that he could ultimately be targeted directly or indirectlyIts something that could be done that would send a very clear signal of taking the gloves off and not just dance around it said Juan C Zarate a White House counterterrorism adviser to President George W Bush who helped pioneer the governments modern financial campaign techniques to choke off terrorist moneySo far the American government has not imposed sanctions on Mr Putin himself and officials said they would not in the short term reasoning that personally targeting a head of state would amount to a nuclear escalation as several put itAmong those likely to be on Mondays list officials said are Igor Sechin president of the Rosneft state oil company and Aleksei Miller head of the Gazprom state energy giantIts like standing in a circle and all of a sudden everyone in the circle is getting a bomb thrown on them and you get the message that its getting close said Senator Robert Menendez Democrat of New Jersey the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee describing at a recent hearing the way the sanctions are getting closer to Mr PutinPutins DenialsMr Putins reported income for 2013 was just 102000 according to a Kremlin statement this month Over the years he has crudely dismissed suggestions of personal wealth I have seen some papers about this he said at a news conference in 2008 Just gossip thats not worth discussing Its simply rubbish They picked everything out of someones nose and smeared it on their little papersHow much Mr Putin cares about money has long been a subject of debate both in Russia and in the West On government payrolls since his days in the KGB the Soviet intelligence agency Mr Putin to many seemed driven more by power and nationalism than by material gain With access to government perks like palaces planes and luxury cars he seemingly has little need for personal wealthIf he really does have all that money salted away somewhere why asked Bruce K Misamore who was the chief financial officer of Yukos Oil before the Russian government imprisoned its top shareholder Mikhail B Khodorkovsky seized its assets and gave many of them to Mr Sechins Rosneft What good does it do him Is it just ego Presumably its not to pass it down to heirs I doubt well see Mr Putin becoming one of the leading philanthropists in the worldAnd yet some have drawn attention to what appear to be expensive watches on his wrist and the construction of a seaside palace that the Kremlin denied was being built for Mr Putin Some argue that Mr Putin may want money or the appearance of it because it is the measure of stature and power in a society whose transition to capitalism has produced instant billionaires out of the wreckage of CommunismI came to the conclusion after time that some of these reports may be seeded by people around Putin himself said Fiona Hill who was the chief Russia expert at the National Intelligence Council and last year cowrote a book about Mr Putin Russians have to have the biggest and the best Its part of the mystique part of the imageThe Treasury Department has not provided evidence to back up its statement about Mr Putin but standard policy requires it to have enough verification to withstand a court challenge Gunvor a Swissbased firm that is the worlds fourthlargest oil trader and generated 91 billion in revenue last year said it had subsequently provided documents to the Treasury Department that it said disproved any connection to Mr PutinSome Obama administration officials have argued for releasing details of what the United States knows about Mr Putins wealth to expose him to the Russian public a suggestion so far resisted by the White House Some lawmakers in Congress are discussing legislation to require the administration to publish an estimate of Mr Putins overall worthAmerican diplomatic cables obtained by the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks show sustained attention to the subject The cables tied Mr Putin not only to Gunvor but also to Surgutneftegaz a large oil company and even to Gazprom but they used words like rumored In one cable for instance diplomats cited a General Electric executive working in the region who privately said that Mr Yakunin the president of the stateowned Russian Railways has made sizable cash payments to Putin and estimated that the Russian leader was worth well over 10 billionThe CIA in 2007 produced a secret assessment of Mr Putins wealth that has never been released according to officials who have read it The assessment the officials said largely tracked with assertions later made publicly by a Russian political analyst who said Mr Putin effectively controlled holdings in Gunvor Gazprom and Surgutneftegaz that added up to about 40 billion at the timeTrailed by SuspicionFrom the start of his political career Mr Putin has been dogged by suspicion While he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in the 1990s his office signed deals giving favored companies licenses to export 92 million in oil timber metal and other products in exchange for an equal amount of imported food But the food never materializedMr Putin was not accused of personally benefiting but a City Council committee led by Marina Salye recommended Mr Putins dismissal for incompetence and unprecedented negligence and irresponsibility She also pushed for prosecutors to investigate Mr Putin blamed the companies involved and was spared by the mayor Anatoly A Sobchak his political patronStill it was not clear whether Mr Putin in that era coveted money for himself or was more interested in deciding how it would be distributed as state assets were gobbled up by newly minted capitalists Boris A Berezovsky the tycoon who helped install Mr Putin in the Kremlin only to fall out with him and become his most bitter opponent told a story of seeking and receiving Mr Putins help with a business venture in St Petersburg and then offering him a bribe in thanks only to be turned downFor the United States seeking intelligence on Russia became a lower priority after the attacks of Sept 11 2001 But Washington got a rare look into the world of money and the Kremlin after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 Charles A Duelfer the weapons inspector uncovered a web of lucrative Iraqi oil vouchers given to close Putin associates including his chief of staff and the presidential office itself in hope of eroding support for international sanctionsIn a later book Mr Duelfer wrote that Colin L Powell then the secretary of state objected to mentioning Mr Putin for diplomatic reasons By listing a Russian state company under Mr Putins control Mr Powell said you are implicating Putin Mr Duelfer said he reluctantly took Mr Putins name out of the report Mr Powell said last week that he did not recall the episodeIn 2006 Mr Bush kicked off an initiative targeting corrupt foreign leaders Over the next year his administration focused attention on learning more about the finances of leaders in the former Soviet Union like Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Aleksandr G Lukashenko of BelarusThe 2007 CIA assessment grew out of that But different officials came away with different impressions of its reliability Some said they considered it a reasonable appraisal of Mr Putins worth based on solid reporting Others said they considered it to be built largely on speculation and unsubstantiated talkEither way the assessment roughly mirrored estimates made publicly at the end of that year by Stanislav Belkovsky a Russian political analyst with ties to the Kremlin whose public attack on oligarchs several years earlier had presaged the arrest and prosecution of Mr Khodorkovsky of YukosMr Belkovsky told European newspapers in December 2007 that Mr Putin had amassed a fortune of at least 40 billion through sizable shares of some of Russias largest energy companies Mr Putin secretly controlled at least 75 percent of Gunvor 45 percent of Gazprom and 37 percent of Surgutneftegaz Mr Belkovsky said citing only unnamed Kremlin insidersThe reality is that Putin has others and entities to move money that he controls or that he might control ultimately said Mr Zarate the former Bush adviser The challenge with him is you dont have an easy way of drawing the line to the assets he actually owns and controls currently Theres a dimension of layering and relationships with people with whom hes close and entities that serve as conduits that make it tricky to determine what is Putins and what is notEfforts to Open CurtainIn the years since others have taken a look at Mr Putins finances The magazine The Economist linked Mr Putin to Mr Timchenko in 2008 Mr Timchenko sued but later dropped the case and The Economist issued a statement We accept Gunvors assurances that neither Vladimir Putin nor any other senior Russian political figures have any ownership in Gunvor the magazine saidIn 2010 Sergei Kolesnikov a businessman published an open letter saying he had helped Mr Putin secretly build a billiondollar palace on the Black Sea The Kremlin dismissed his claims as absurd In 2012 Boris Y Nemtsov an opposition leader released a report detailing the presidential perks at Mr Putins disposal including 20 residences 15 helicopters four yachts and 43 aircraftBut some hunting for Mr Putins private wealth have found obstacles Last month Cambridge University Press declined to publish a book by its longtime author Karen Dawisha a Miami University professor exploring how Mr Putin built a kleptocratic and authoritarian regime in Russia The publisher wrote her saying it had no reason to doubt the veracity of her book but deemed the risk of a lawsuit too high according to letters published by The Economist In a return letter Ms Dawisha called the decision preemptive book burningAll of which makes the Treasury Departments assertions last month so striking In addition to targeting Mr Timchenko one of the founders of Gunvor the department froze any American assets of Mr Kovalchuk and his Bank Rossiya It described Rossiya as the personal bank for senior officials and described Mr Kovalchuk as one of Mr Putins cashiersMr Timchenko denied the assertions and sold his 43 percent share in Gunvor to his partner Torbjorn Tornqvist the day before the sanctions were issued to avoid repercussions to the firm The sale contract has no conditions or provisions for buying the shares back and Mr Tornqvist now holds 87 percent of the company while senior employees own the rest the company saidSeth Thomas Pietras Gunvors corporate affairs director said Mr Putin does not and never has had any ownership direct indirect or otherwise in Gunvor nor is he a beneficiary of Gunvor and he has no access to Gunvors funds After the sanctions statement Gunvor executives flew to Washington to meet with State Department officials and congressional aides Were providing evidence but have not seen any sort of evidence from them yet and dont know if we ever will Mr Pietras said He said the companys banking partners had been satisfied by its explanationsThe Treasury Department however was not We remain confident that the information on the relationship between Putin and Gunvor is accurate said a Treasury official who asked not to be identified in a public dispute with the companyGarry Kasparov the Russian chess master turned opposition leader said Mr Putins wealth must be so buried that it would be difficult to prove within the standards typically required by American lawyers Im sure its reachable but you might have to break some of the rules to reach it he said The sanctions issued so far he said have not made enough of an impression They have to convince Putin that it will be serious he saidSteven Lee Myers and David M

lots of other installments in the anthology series or sports documentaries in general Phi Slama Jama is about losing the big gameTheres a poignant sequence where we see several players in the present

basically vanished from public lifeAs always the vintage broll and jazzy montages fit right into the pleasure receptors in ones brain but the real intrigue in Slama is its approach to the flip side of

one certainly could But what would a good remake of RHPS even mean Part of the point of Rocky Horror is its production values the lack of polish The charisma bursts out of the shabbinessUnlike several other recent TV musicals this glossy revival is not live which adds another layer of prim detachment This is exacerbated by a framing mechanism where we occasionally see a movie theater crowd doing

98,AdvertisementSupported byWe know that resentment is driving much of Donald Trumps success  resentment of elites of the political class of illegal immigrants of protesters of the media  and perhaps most particularly of changes in the demographic makeup of the country that Trump and his followers find unwelcomePart of the explanation for the triumph of resentment is political and economic but one question has nagged at me What is the psychological mechanism underpinning this resentmentMore to the pointOpposition to the surge of nonEuropean nonwhite immigration is a bedrock of the Trump campaign a crucial element of his attack on political correctness and a key component of the loyalty he elicits from noncollege middle and lowerincome voters opposed to liberalized immigration  voters who believe they have been dispossessedIn an email Anastasopoulos writes thatpolls conducted by large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the United States overall rather than say Dayton Ohio or Wilmington North Carolina places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years This kind of abstract framing tends to push respondents toward giving more politically correct answers to standard poll questions about immigrationThe result isa significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the publicThe refusal of Democrats and the American left to hear  or to grant some legitimacy to  the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature to ascendant minorities and to waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement In the zero sum world of immigration politics it has proved impossible so far to convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sidesThe quest by American liberals and progressives for support or at least tolerance of diversity inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely to prevail  particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailedthe feeling you get when people try to stop you from doing something youve been doing and you perceive that they have no right or justification for stopping you So you redouble your efforts and do it even more just to show that you dont accept their domination Men in particular are concerned to show that they do not accept dominationPsychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged to adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior Specifically a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state called psychological reactance that elicits behaviors intended to restore this autonomyHaidt applies this to the 2016 electionTranslated to the Trump phenomenon I would say that decades of political correctness with its focus on straight white men as the villains and oppressors  now extended to straight white cisgendered men  has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white menIn both the workplace and academia Haidt arguesthe accusatory and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men to say and do unPC thingsIn this atmosphere according to HaidtTrump comes along and punches political correctness in the face Anyone feeling some degree of antiPC reactance is going to feel a thrill in their heart and will want to stand up and applaud And because feelings drive reasoning these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone to present arguments to them about the downsides of a Trump presidencyTrumps anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks to the resentment of many American men and their resistance to being instructed particularly by a female candidate on how they should think speak or behaveI have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak  I am not going to deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me He can say whatever he wants to say about me I could really care lessI dont think a nation can be great that turns its back on the poor and the unfortunateWeve got to do more to raise families incomes We can start by raising the federal minimum wageWere stronger together When we embrace immigrants not denigrate them When we build bridges not wallsTrump has made Clinton his foil of choiceOn Dec 21 2015 Trump told an audience in Grand RapidsEven a race with Obama she was gonna beat Obama I dont know who would be worse I dont know how could it be worse But she was going to beat  she was favored to win  and she got schlonged she lost I mean she lostI really deplore the tone of his campaign the inflammatory rhetoric that he is using to divide people and his going after groups of people with hateful incendiary rhetoricNothing really surprises me anymore I dont know that he has any boundaries at all His bigotry his bluster his bullying have become his campaign And he has to keep sort of upping the stakes and going even furtherIm answering him on what I think voters care about Im answering him on the differences between our records our experience what we want to do for our country how important it is to try to unify the countryJesse Graham a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California suggested that the fact that Clinton is a woman plays a role in this dynamic noting that many Trump followers respond to Clinton in a fashion similar to that of8th grade boys reacting to their homeroom teacher But I think this has more to do with her gender than with any particular behaviors on her part  in other words there are some who would respond to any woman running for president as an 8th grader in homeroom who resents the teacherSimon Hedlin a public policy researcher noted thatsince reactance is driven by perceptions rather than by facts this works well in Trumps favor considering his often cavalier relationship with the truthIn other words reactance can foster a totalizing loyalty that does not respond to reasoned fault finding This might help explain Trumps seeming immunity to criticism from his adversaries His followers feel that they have experienced a diminution of freedom and believe that Trump can restore their autonomyHe has won a unique admixture of support based in part on what might be called an antirational or irrational loyalty but also in part on his recognition of legitimate grievances among his adherents that many other politicians belittle or deny This loyalty as Republican candidates found during the primaries is far wider and deeper than anyone not sharing it expectedClinton remains the favorite but she faces five months of treading water in a shark tank She has yet to discover a compelling rebuttal to Trump on political correctness and it will be difficult for her to placate opponents of immigration while holding her advantage with her base Nonetheless although her bite is not as lethal as Trumps she will soon have almost the entire Democratic Party in her corner including a cadre of operatives whose specialty is drawing bloodThomas B Edsall is the author most recently of The Age of Austerity How Scarcity Will

New Jerseys little towns as Peyton Places with secrets in every cupboard and they raise the question If the suburbs are so boring why is this stuff so fascinatingBut nothing in The Sopranos was sexier

I include shots of the waterfall and the more bucolic scenes For such a small place it has a lot of facets to it And thats only northern New Jersey I wish we could go down the shore but on our budget we cant sort of like when I was in high schoolAnd then there was that littleknown comedian from Lawrenceville Jon Stewart before he transformed comedy television with The Daily Show No wonder that by

101,AdvertisementSurpassing the anxious entreaties of an ordinary presidential race Mrs Clinton and Mr Trump begged voters to see the 2016 election as a choice of almost apocalyptic significance Mr Trump called the vote on Tuesday a final chance to turn back foreign forces menacing American identity while Mrs Clinton said the countrys long journey toward equality for women and minorities was at risk of being reversed in a days ballotingMrs Clinton began her day in Philadelphia speaking at the Mount Airy Church of God in Christ with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey a fellow Democrat In a city where high black turnout could seal her grip on the presidency Mrs Clinton framed the campaign in the context of historic struggles for equality  from the origins of the womens rights movement in Seneca Falls NY to the march for black civil rights in Selma AlaEverything you care about everything I care about and have worked for is at stake Mrs Clinton said without mentioning Mr TrumpAdvertisementAdvertisementMr Trump for his part warned voters that they would never again see a candidate like him within reach of the presidency At a rally in Sioux City Iowa he said repeatedly that he represented a last chance for voters angry about trade and immigrationThe media Wall Street and the politicians are trying to stop us because they know we will fix the rigged system he saidThe announcement from James B Comey the FBI director reaffirming his assessment that Mrs Clinton should not be charged with a crime over her handling of classified information came as a blow to Mr Trump and other Republicans hoping that a preelection bombshell would upend Mrs Clintons campaignMrs Clinton and her leading surrogates have also been making a lastminute appeal asking voters to embrace the idea of a female president seeking to increase her lead among women and to persuade some hesitant men to discard their reservations about Mrs Clintons genderCampaigning in Florida over the weekend Mr Kaine accused Mr Trump of tapping into sexism as a political tactic He reproached Mr Trump for saying at a rally that military officers would not want to follow orders from Mrs Clinton and for suggesting that she did not look presidentialAdvertisementIn Wisconsin on Sunday Mr Kaine hailed the historic nature of Mrs Clintons candidacy and urged confident Democrats not to take victory for grantedIf it had been easy for there to be a woman president of the United States there would have been a woman president of the United States he saidThe Clinton campaign also booked national airtime during football games on Sunday night to run a pair of commercials featuring men who said they could not vote for Mr Trump because of his treatment of womenAnd Mrs Clinton campaigned this weekend with two singers Katy Perry and Beyonc who have hailed her as a barrierbreaking candidateIn some respects the campaign of encouragement and reassurance echoes the Democrats successful push in 2008 to ease any hesitation about Barack Obama among white voters That year prominent white men in the party  including Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware now the vice president and Richard L Trumka an AFLCIO executive  made intensive efforts to bring along reluctant white votersStephanie Schriock the president of Emilys List a group that supports female Democratic candidates said it had been important for leaders like President Obama and Mr Kaine to speak directly to voters who may still feel hesitant about electing a womanMs Schriock said Mr Kaine and Mr Obama had also helped send the message to wavering men that Mr Trumps treatment of women was not normal behaviorTom Bonier a Democratic data strategist and the chief executive of the firm TargetSmart said there was ample evidence that women were especially motivated to vote in this election He added that enthusiasm from female voters alone could push Mrs Clintons final vote tally a point above where she stands in public pollsAdvertisementIn every single battleground state women not only make up a clear majority of ballots cast thus far but the female share of the electorate is larger than it was in the 2012 election he saidFemale voters may play an especially influential role in a few states Mr Trump is targeting late in the campaign including Pennsylvania Michigan and Minnesota where there are fewer nonwhite voters and Mrs Clintons lead depends in part on white women in the suburbsMr Trump has increasingly staked his candidacy on longshot states in the Upper Midwest that have not voted Republican in a generation or more in an attempt to escape the backlash against his candidacy from Latino voters in more diverse swing statesWhat you need to know to start your day delivered to your inbox Monday

a frenzied pace on Sunday with events planned in five states and stretching well into the night as he fell behind schedule But with the exception of Iowa where he is ahead in the polls Mr Trump is competing on unfriendly turf scrounging for support in unlikely areas like liberalleaning Minneapolis and the prosperous suburbs of Northern VirginiaWhile Mrs Clinton has campaigned with an eye toward turning out specific voter groups in crucial states  firing up black voters in North Carolina and Latinos in South and Central Florida for instance  Mr Trump has crisscrossed a wider map of states but he has done little to attract support beyond his mostly white less educated political baseIn Minneapolis home to a sizable population of immigrants Mr Trump railed against refugees coming into the United States and singled out Minnesotas Somali community for attackMr Trumps campaign drew criticism over the weekend for releasing a twominute closing advertisement that cast Mr Trump as an opponent of international financial interests and pictured three people  Janet L Yellen the Federal Reserve chairwoman Lloyd C Blankfein the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and George Soros the liberal investor  as emblematic of the forces aligned against Mr Trump All three of those people are JewishIn a statement the AntiDefamation League said the ad had  perhaps unintentionally  invoked subjects that antiSemites have used for agesJason D Greenblatt a lawyer for Mr Trump said any suggestion that the ad had been antiSemitic was completely false and uncalledforAmy Chozick Thomas Kaplan and

102,AdvertisementThe University of AlabamaBirmingham said Tuesday that it was terminating its football program becoming the first university in college sports top tier to do so in nearly 20 years and providing the most visible sign yet that athletic officials throughout the country are considering radical options in the face of mounting financial burdensIt was this decision that prompted an internal study at AlabamaBirmingham whose football team recently finished its regular season with a 66 record and is eligible to play in a bowl game for the first time since 2004 The judgment according to a news release Tuesday from the universitys president Dr Ray L Watts was that football is simply not sustainableUAB already needed to subsidize twothirds of its 30 million athletic operating budget and major capital improvements were seen as necessary to maintain a viable program As a result UAB  a team from Conference USA situated in footballs hotbed 50 miles from the campus of the No 1 team in the nation Alabama  has been forced to capitulate The last college in the top subdivision of Division I to get rid of its football program was the University of the PacificAdvertisementAdvertisementWere going to fight speed with speed Sean Frazier the athletic director at Northern Illinois saidWe cut through the rankings turmoil to tell you which teams have the inside trackThe cost will be steep particularly for teams in the American Athletic MidAmerican Mountain West and Sun Belt Conferences and Conference USA  the five football leagues not among the Big 5 in the Football Bowl Subdivision Division Is top tier Many of their athletic departments require student fees to support their teams and some people worry students will be squeezed even harderA Sea ChangeFor years universities with fewer financial resources have tried to compete with the traditional college sports powers The little guys too have built new facilities and paid their coaches higher salaries even as the financial gap has widened thanks to bigger conferences signing television contracts worth billions of dollarsHistorically though the smaller universities were able to rein in their larger competitors to some degree especially when it came to benefits for players In 2011 after the NCAAs executive committee voted to allow an annual 2000 stipend for players universities vetoed the rule with an override vote They were led by programs in the smaller conferences with many citing costsThree years later it appears that they have given up fighting the sea change in collegiate athletics spurred by a union movement and lawsuits Now the centerpiece of the first changes from the Big 5 conferences is increasing the value of a yearly scholarship by several thousand dollarsAdvertisementProviding greater resources for our studentathletes is something weve neglected in the past and its time to readdress the definition of the athletic scholarships the Sun Belt commissioner Karl Benson said adding that Sun Belt colleges would maintain independence in how they implemented potential changesCritics contend that more athletic spending is further proof of misplaced priorities at universities that simply cannot afford it Yet in interviews with about a dozen commissioners and administrators nearly all said they were determined to remain competitive on the field despite the costsAnd Val Ackerman commissioner of the Big East a nonfootball conference said there was almost no struggle reaching unanimity among her leagues 10 members about whether to follow the Big 5s lead A major reason cited by all the commissioners was recruitingIf this is what its going to take to make sure we have access to the kinds of players that our coaches want to coach and our schools want as part of their communities Ms Ackerman said theyre going to do itDavid Ridpath a professor at Ohio University a member of the MAC has raised a familiar question financing He said colleges in his conference relied heavily on student fees to finance their athletic programs the Big 5 conferences have expensive broadcast rights fees and their own networksAt the big schools television money pays the bills Dr Ridpath said Here were talking about kids going further into debt for the football team Im all for benefits for athletes but at some point these schools have to accept who they are Ohio isnt Ohio State and we have to be OK with thatPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersIn a study to be published in the Journal of Sport this winter Dr Ridpath calculated that in 201213 MAC students spent on average more than 300 per semester subsidizing athletics During a time of mounting student debt that is nearly 2500 over four yearsCost of AttendanceThe Big 5s legislation centerpiece  cost of attendance as it is called  is designed to bridge the gap between what is currently covered tuition books housing and common expenses like travel home The price tag varies among universities ranging from a few thousand dollars to closer to 10000 per athleteAdvertisementMr Jay is aware of the grim financial outlook though He said Hawaii moved 14 million in accumulated debt from the athletic department to the university last year He is spending an extra 350000 this year to provide more meals to athletes after NCAA rules were relaxedI recognize that students are strapped so I dont want to do this on their backs he said Its my responsibility to find the money elsewhere A lot depends on the football team winningWeve published maps showing where fan support for one team begins and another ends for baseball and basketball Now were pleased to offer another one the United States according to college football fansIt comes down to fundraising he saidMr Bleymaier would like more help from the larger universities although he does not expect it he said More revenue sharing would be beneficial he said but he also said that if more marquee teams were willing to play teams from other conferences on the road those programs could generate more interest and more moneyOther Issues LoomingCost of attendance may be just the beginning The NCAA is appealing a ruling by a federal judge that declared that rules prohibiting athletes from profiting from their images were illegal The judge suggested colleges provide athletes with trust funds worth 5000 per year which the Big 5 could do At some point they could also seek to increase the number of scholarships they are allowed to offer or loosen restrictions on athletes relationships with agents and advisersWhat I am concerned about are the unknowns said Mr Frazier the athletic director at Northern Illinois who played football at Alabama and previously worked in Wisconsins athletic department Thats what keeps me up in the middle of the night How far are these institutions willing to go to separate themselves I do know the capabilities they haveAdvertisementThose in other leagues will have tough decisions about where to draw the lineYou have institutional ego involved Mr Yeager the commissioner of the Colonial Athletic Association said You get to the point where you cant let go and then places will be getting rid of the president and AD for not being visionary enough But at some point you have to figure out where to cut your lossesStill Justin Craft the leader of the B Club a group of vocal UAB football supporters wondered about his alma mater without the sportThe team builds a national brand he said People around the country dont know who UAB is except that they saw them play Mississippi State on the SEC NetworkAny subsidies the athletic department needs should be viewed as a marketing expense he saidWhile Mr Craft simply hoped for the chance to see his alma maters team take the field next fall at Northern Illinois plans were announced in November to expand and retrofit the 49yearold football facility Huskie Stadium to raise money and attract recruitsYoure either moving forward or moving back Mr Frazier said As my wife

103,AdvertisementThe spectacle of more than 150 young women telling their stories of sexual abuse before a court the world and the perpetrator himself seemed straight from the movies a cathartic ending to a dark yearslong drama that had been all too realIt is rare perhaps unprecedented for so many victims to stand in court and with the encouragement of a judge to describe aloud for days the abuse they endured Therapists said that the chance to testify at the sentencing hearing of Dr Lawrence B Nassar was worth taking for those who felt ready to do soThe women were taken at their word they were part of group bonded by shared experience and they saw justice done before their eyesI cant think of a better scenario said Elaine Ducharme a psychologist in Glastonbury Conn who specializes in treating trauma from sexual abuse and other violations To have the judge hear them to allow their stories to influence her decisions and all without putting them through the trauma of an actual trial Most of them are likely to have felt tremendous reliefAdvertisementYet such scenarios are rare as many less prominent victims know Disclosing a traumatic secret  telling your story in all its awful detail  is a dicey proposition that may or may not bring relief depending on whos listening and the nature of the trauma itself Dr Ducharme and other experts saidAdvertisementThe questionnaires made no difference the women who got them fared no better or worse than women in a comparison group who did notThe underlying dynamic of so much abuse is coercive control so pushing people to disclose can replicate those patterns of coercion and backfire Dr Wathen saidOne of the more surprising recent findings was the discrediting of what is called critical incident stress debriefing the practice once common of pushing people still reeling from a traumatic event like an earthquake or school shooting to talk through its effectsStudies have found that such debriefings had no impact on subsequent symptoms of traumatic stress for most people  and made some individuals feel worse The implication was that recounting a tale of trauma shortly after it happens does not necessarily contribute to healing itIt was hard to believe what the data were saying said Richard McNally a professor of psychology at Harvard But you just dont know what effect interventions really have until you test themHe was lauded as the mustsee doctor who worked with Americas best gymnasts Now Lawrence G Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison Over seven days women recounted his sexual abuse at a marathon sentencing hearing in MichiganPeople do best when allowed to tell their stories in their own time if they choose to do so at all therapists saidAdvertisementThe details of a persons trauma are another consideration Memory is a shapeshifting idiosyncratic process with a life of its ownFor reasons no one understands some people who were sexually abused as children exhibit no measurable psychological wounds as adults research suggests nor do they ruminate on past violationsPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersOthers feel the wounds as freshly today as ever reacting with extreme emotion to benign random reminders in everyday life a hand on a shoulder a half smile from a stranger the sight of a doctors officeFor such people unloading their story  even in the safety of a supportive group directly meting out justice to a perpetrator  can provide relief but not resolution therapists saidIts often a beginning not the end said Dr Ducharme There will be more work to doOne of the most striking features of the recent court proceedings was the sight of so many survivors directly witnessing  and helping seal  the perpetrators comeuppance Seeing justice done is widely believed to be a psychological balm in itself a gratifying if usually belated repair of faithBut justice does not always deliver relief studies find and the reason may lie in the type of trauma experiencedTestifying in court might be helpful not necessarily because of restoration of a sense of justice but because of the exposure element the whole court process involves Dr Basoglu said in an emailAdvertisementThe value in telling the story may not be that it leads to justice then but that it helps the speaker regain control of a narrative that plays out endlessly in his or her mindIn treatment Dr Basoglu said we would have presented testifying at court as an exposure task to overcome or gain a sense of control over the distress and fear caused by the traumaIn that sense the women who told of their abuse so publicly in Dr Nassars trial were asserting control not only for themselves but also for others who werent yet ready to step in front of the camerasThe women who did not report their stories  the important thing is that they should not feel guilty about it said Judith Alpert a professor of applied psychology at New York UniversityThey all have their reasons and theyre good ones fear that their family would fall apart or how their spouse would react Its their choice and what matters is what is best for themGo to Home Page,movies,"['advertisementthe', 'spectacle', 'of', 'more', 'than', '150', 'young', 'women', 'telling', 'their', 'stories', 'of', 'sexual',

104,AdvertisementTheres no risk that Katniss Everdeen the warrior who has led the charge against oppression in The Hunger Games movies can ever return to her current incarnation Even if she and her world are rebooted back into franchise existence by a ravenous studio her moment was now Katniss as played by Jennifer Lawrence over three years and four blockbusters has evolved from a backwoods scrapper in the first movie into a battlescarred champion and an exemplar of female power on screen and off  and the battles shes fought have extended far beyond the fictional nation of PanemThe Times critic Manohla Dargis reviews The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2So yes of course Katniss is back just as promised by the clumsy title of her last movie The Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 1 In Part 2 she has returned as destined to finish the fight defeat the enemy and send off a bigscreen series that has had an astonishing run both in coldcash terms and in its meaningful symbolism Shes ready Since 2012 when the first movie landed Katniss has grown into her role as a savior an evolution that parallels that of Ms Lawrence who entered the series as a Sundance starlet and leaves it as one of the biggest stars in the world Both have grown exponentially rising to the demands of their loving audienceIn the land of Panem Katniss Everdeen leads a rebellion against the corrupt and tyrannical city CapitolIf Katniss escaped that old binary its because Ms Collins created a character who exists outside the traditional confines of the femininemasculine split and because the movies have stayed true to that original conception At once a hunter and a nurturer Katniss is tough and teary stoic and sentimental which give her layers that reflect her changeable inner states as well as her public and private identities as daughter sister lover and leader Its instructive that shes worn her most overtly glamourgirl outfits as part of the farcical role forced on her by the totalitarian government that rules Panem having been dolled up with makeup and smiles for the televised sideshows that accompany the murderous games of the series title Shes since graduated to basic battle black or unisex clothing thats suggestive of a Dystopian GapAdvertisementPart 2 more or less picks up where the last movie left off with Katniss and the rest of the rebel forces closing in on the government and Panems leader President Snow the invaluable Donald Sutherland leading with an insouciant selfamused smile There are no real surprises though many familiar faces some of whom Jeffrey Wright and more movingly Philip Seymour Hoffman flash by so quickly that they feel like guests who have popped in only to say goodbye As with a lot of contemporary franchises this one stocked the supporting roles with veterans who have given ballast to a largely unmemorable young cast including the insipid twosome  Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale  who have wanly bookended Katniss from the startLike the previous two movies Part 2 was directed by Francis Lawrence who like most franchise filmmakers was not hired for the quality of his miseenscne but for one job to not screw up an extremely valuable property The first was shepherded by Gary Ross whose cinematographer Tom Stern alas also departed the series And so mission accomplished largely with a lot of conversational faceoffs and regular bursts of showy violence that sometimes turn panoramic allowing you to admire the scale of the apocalyptically dressed sets To that instrumental end the actors hit their marks while running and gunning amid the gray rubble and black ooze although Mr Lawrence does raise some nice shivers in a tunnel sequence making the horrific most out of the darkAdvertisementPart 2 looks much like most contemporary dystopian future worlds one thats by turns similar enough to ours to be reassuring and different enough to be diverting What makes the material still feel personal  other than the yearslong investment and love that transform entertainments into fan communities  is the combination of Katniss and Ms Lawrence who have become a perfect fit Ms Lawrence now inhabits the role as effortlessly as breathing partly because like all great stars she seems to be playing a version of her real self Its the kind of realness that can give you and the movie a jolt as in a scene with Ms Lawrence and a sensationally raw Jena Malone that thrusts it into that place where heroes and villains give way to something like lifeIts crucial to the conception of Katniss that most of the characters more emotionally plangent scenes have been with other women including her family friends and other Hunger Games combatants Some of this can be chalked up to casting and together with Ms Lawrence Ms Malone Natalie Dormer Patina Miller and Michelle Forbes make one of the toughest groups of women to band together on screen since Quentin Tarantinos Death Proof his ode to exploitation cinema and its chicks This series has had its share of robust male assistance notably from Mr Sutherland and Woody Harrelson but its been distracting and at times more than a little amusing that Katnisss love interests are played by the blindingly bland brotherhood of Mr Hutcherson and Mr HemsworthIntentional or not their casting ensured that in the movies just as in the books Katniss was never going to be upstaged by a love interest The Hunger Games may have shocked readers and viewers with its childonchild violence but even more startling and certainly far more pleasurable has been the girlwoman at its center who can lead troops like a reborn Joan of Arc yet find time to nuzzle the downy lips of her male comrades before returning to battle Her desire is as fluid as her gender whether shes slipping into froufrou shooting down enemy aircraft kissing a boy or taking a punch Unlike a lot of screen heroines she has never settled into stereotype which despite the whole dystopian thing makes her a lot like the contemporary girls and women watching herHowever mythic this figure  individual selfreliant fundamentally innocent  the illusion of freedom he enjoys is meaningful Lewis argues because it makes for fiction capable of profound tragic understanding rather than hopelessness Even inadequately this Adam struggles because as with his biblical namesake the world and history lay all before him by contrast these lay all behind Katniss who has endured history violence and death Yet she goes forth into her world because she too has an illusion of freedom one which has spared us the nihilism polluting too many movies and has meant that she is neither Adam nor Eve but something else And it is only by being this something else not the Girl not the Virgin or the Whore that she has been able both to love and to fight including against the big bad patriarchThe success of The Hunger Games series has been itself in its bottomline fashion a rejoinder to another intolerant regime that of a movie industry that continues to treat women on and off the screen as a distraction an afterthought and a problem A few months into its run the second installment Catching Fire became the first movie with a lone female lead to top the annual domestic box office in four decades Thats astonishing because it reveals the historical depths of the industrys inequities even while it speaks to the audiences embrace of this series There are all sorts of reasons that viewers have flocked to these movies including the studio hard sell but I like to think the numbers prove that in rallying to Katnisss side theyre also backing the other liberation struggle she has come to representThe Hunger Games Mockingjay Part 2 is rated PG13 Parents strongly cautioned Apocalyptic violence

107,AdvertisementVietnam The word comes camouflaged in music Rock n roll soul pop and country For those who watched the war unfold on the evening news the music of Vietnam blurred with the sounds rising from the streets of America during a time of momentous challenge and change For those born after the last helicopters sank beneath the waves of the South China Sea movies documentaries and TV shows have repeatedly used music as a sonic background for depicting Vietnam as a tug of war between prowar hawks and propeace dovesIf you werent there its possible to imagine this as so much postproduction editing imposing a relationship between the sounds and the experience of the war It can all feel a bit trite Except  its trueMore than any other American war Vietnam had a soundtrack and you listened to it whether you were marching in the jungle or in the streets For the men and women like me who served in Southeast Asia music was what inexorably linked us to my generation We sang along to the Beatles Nancy Sinatra Marty Robbins and the Temptations before we went to war and we listened to them after we came back homeAdvertisementAnd once we returned home music became essential to our healingHistorians of the 60s have recognized the importance of music as a lens for understanding movements attitudes and opinions For Vietnam veterans and those who listen to their stories the iconic music of the 1960s and early 70s provides access to a truer deeper story of what Vietnam meant and continues to meanAdvertisementWith the crucial exception of combat music was ubiquitous in Vietnam reaching soldiers via albums cassettes and tapes of radio shows sent from home on the Armed Forces Vietnam Network featuring songs from stateside Top 40 stations and on the legendary if shortlived underground broadcasts of Radio First Termer a pirate station operated out of Saigon Soldiers played it in their hooches on topoftheline tape decks theyd purchase cheap at the PX or via mail order from Japan they listened to it over headphones in helicopters and planesThis weekly newsletter includes eyewitness accounts rare photos and historical insights about the Vietnam WarPlease

who flooded him with hate mail  he still receives it  were unaware of the crucial fact that Joe McDonald was a Navy veteran one whod realized that as he put it all military experience all combat experience universally is the same  not goodbad moralimmoral I believe if we had the music of all these different armies all the infantries everywhere youd have the same attitude expressed within their songs that we expressed in oursReturning to the Bay Area after his discharge from the Navy Joe threw himself into the growing counterculture In the summer of 1965 he wrote the song that even today is an anthem of the antiwar movement yet holds a special resonance for Vietnam veterans a point we heard again and again from the hundreds of Vietnam veterans weve interviewedThe song was irreverent but not political Joe explained It blames leaders and parents not soldiers Its not a pacifist song its a soldiers song The most radical line in the song he added is Be the first one on your block to have your boy come home in a box Its military humor that only a soldier could get away with Its a soldiers song from a soldiers background and point of view It comes out of a tradition of GI humor in which people can bitch in a way that will not get them in trouble and that also keeps them from insanity that can be experienced during warAs the war ground on and the casualties mounted music became even more essential for troops and veterans struggling to express their feelings and understand the politics of the war and politics in general The war was coming to an end and those of us still there and the veterans who were already back home understood that it would be music that helped us reintegrate into civilian life As Michael Kramer observes in The Republic of Rock the music of the 1960s and early 70s gave the generation a sonic framework for thinking feeling discussing and dancing out the vexing problems of democratic togetherness and individual liberationIf you were fortunate enough to return home from Vietnam music echoed through those secret places where you stored memories including some you never shared with your parents spouse or children for decades Music was the key to survival and a path to healing the center of a human story thats too often lost in the haze of politics and myth that surrounds VietnamSee More Go to Home

108,AdvertisementWASHINGTON   In 2004 relatives of some American citizens killed or injured by terrorist attacks in Israel sought redress in an unusual way They filed a multibilliondollar lawsuit against Arab Bank the largest financial institution in Jordan accusing it of transferring funds to Hamas leaders and other terrorists responsible for the attacksA decade later the case has provoked a significant split in the Obama administration according to current and former officials pitting the State Department which wants the administration to come to the banks aid against the Treasury and Justice Departments which want the government to stay out of it The case is scheduled to go to trial in AugustBut Arab Bank has asked the Supreme Court to intervene now and overturn sanctions imposed by the trial judge when the bank refused to turn over private customer records The Supreme Court has asked whether the government thinks it should hear the case and the Obama administration is at an impasse over what to tell the justicesThe quandary facing the administration stems from the unusual tradeoffs between issues that are rarely linked including diplomatic efforts to achieve Middle East peace the rights of American victims of terrorism and an American campaign to tear down Swiss banking secrecy laws that have long aided tax evasionAdvertisementAdvertisementThe lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn Known as Linde v Arab Bank in its current form it focuses on the deaths of 39 Americans and the injury of 102 others in two dozen terrorist attacks during the second intifada in the early 2000s The plaintiffs contend the Jordanian bank transferred money to Hamas leaders and administered a Saudifunded program that paid a standard benefit of 5316 to thousands of families of people killed in the conflict with Israel including several suicide bombersThe judge also restricted the banks ability to present information to the jury that could rebut that conclusion such as bringing up the secrecy laws Arab Bank called those sanctions draconian and appealedThe Office of the State Department Legal Adviser the officials said has strongly urged Mr Verrilli to back Supreme Court intervention on behalf of Arab Bank It cited the role Jordan plays as an American ally on matters like the war in Syria counterterrorism investigations and the IsraeliPalestinian peace processThe State Departments arguments appear to closely track those made by the government of Jordan which hired Neal K Katyal a former acting solicitor general in the Obama administration to file a brief before the Supreme Court The bank has hired Paul Clement who served as solicitor general in the George W Bush administrationPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersThe Jordanian brief said the country is a vital ally of Secretary of State John Kerrys renewed peace efforts between Israel and Palestinians And it warned that proceeding to a trial under the sanctions order could devastate the bank and destabilize the economies of Jordan the Palestinian territories and the surrounding regionOn the other side are some lawyers with the Justice Departments National Security Division and with the appellate section of its Civil Division who are reluctant to have the government intervene against American victims of terrorist attacks officials saidAdvertisementThe Justice Departments Tax Division and the Treasury Department have raised a different concern The Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on tax evasion and if the Justice Department says foreign bank secrecy laws should take precedence it could complicate their efforts to overcome such laws in Switzerland and elsewhere officials saidSwiss banking secrecy laws were an impenetrable barrier for generations But in 2009 amid the financial crisis the Swiss government and UBS agreed to turn over information about accounts belonging to Americans and UBS paid a 780 million fineThe United States has built on that precedent to seek access throughout the Swiss banking system and may expand that effort to Luxembourg Israel and Hong Kong said William Sharp of Sharp Partners an international law firm that focuses on taxation issuesTo say that this Lebanese and Jordanian information is protected by secrecy laws would seem to be contrary to what is going on within the Department of Justice and the IRS he said I understand why DOJ and the IRS would not be happy with thisProponents of helping Arab Bank have argued that Mr Verrilli could say that respect for foreign bank secrecy laws should give way when the government seeks information to enforce laws but not when people sue for civil damages officials said But internal critics of intervening have argued that the bank can make that argument itselfAll we want is a fair trial he said We feel there are very compelling defenses

four months into his presidency Mr Trump has grown sour on Mr Sessions now his attorney general blaming him for various troubles that have plagued the White HouseIn private the presidents exasperation has been even sharper He has intermittently fumed for months over Mr Sessionss decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian meddling in last years election according to people close to Mr Trump who insisted on anonymity to describe internal conversations In Mr Trumps view they said it was that recusal that eventually led to the appointment of a special counsel who took over the investigationBehindthescenes frustration would not be unprecedented in the Oval Office Other presidents have become estranged from the Justice Department over time notably President Bill Clinton who bristled at Attorney General Janet Renos decisions to authorize investigations into him and his administration among other things But Mr Trumps tweets on Monday made his feelings evident for all to see and raised questions about how he is managing his own administrationAdvertisementThey wholly undercut the idea that there is some rational process behind the presidents decisions said Walter E Dellinger who served as acting solicitor general under Mr Clinton I believe it is unprecedented for a president to publicly chastise his own Justice DepartmentAdvertisementBut the messages caused considerable head scratching around Washington since it was Mr Trump who signed the revised executive order and presumably agreed to the legal strategy in the first place His posts made it sound like the Justice Department was not part of his administrationThe White House had little to add to the presidents messages on Monday Asked why Mr Trump signed the revised order if he did not support it

better than the first iteration so the lawyers in his book did not do a good job Its understandable for a businessmanIn subsequent posts Mr Conway said that every sensible lawyer in the White House Counsels Office and every political appointee at the Justice Department would agree with me as some have already told me Mr Conway stressed that he strongly supports Mr Trump  and of course my

middle of another event and he publicly questioned the decisionHowever Mr Trump is said to be aware that firing people now on the heels of dismissing James B Comey the FBI director would be risky He

110,AdvertisementWhen his induction was announced at the Super Bowl his family rejoiced and started thinking about what to say at the ceremony in Canton Ohio on Aug 8 Seau had told them that if he ever made it he wanted his daughter Sydney to introduce himAdvertisementTo the Hall of Fame officials simply showing the video which will not invoke Seaus suicide will keep the focus on his playing days To his family still grappling with his death though the decision diminishes the tribute to one of the sports best linebackers and a highly regarded figure in Southern California where he grew up and played most of his careerAdvertisementIts frustrating because the induction is for my father and for the other players but then to not be able to speak its painful Sydney said I just want to give the speech he would have given It wasnt going to be about this mess My speech was solely about himThe Hall said Seaus brain injury and suicide had nothing to do with its decision to show only a video but Seaus death continues to haunt the NFL which collaborates with the Hall on the induction ceremony and for years denied any link between repeated hits on the field and brain diseaseTypically a video produced by NFL Network is shown for each inductee For living inductees a family member or a close associate then introduces the player on stage for what is often an emotionfilled speechIn the past for deceased inductees presenters spoke but Joe Horrigan a spokesman for the Hall who has overseen the enshrinement ceremony for 20 years said they often repeated what was in the video prolonging an already lengthy ceremony So a few years ago the Hall eliminated speeches in these casesThere was an acceptance speech for deceased players but it got redundant Horrigan said The honor is supposed to be for the individualSeaus video tribute will be five minutes two minutes longer than for living inductees Horrigan said It will include parts of an interview his daughter gave to NFL Network

newslettersNot allowing any testimonials raises thorny questions because Seaus death has cast such a long shadow over his stellar 20year career much of which was played in San Diego for the Chargers The decision comes as the NFL tries to repair the damage to its reputation after years of denying that playing the sport could cause brain diseaseAdvertisementThe league agreed to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by thousands of retired players who said they were misled about the dangers of concussions Game rules have been adjusted slightly to reduce the chance of violent collisions and neurotrauma specialists now roam the sidelines The league has committed to spending at least 40 million on concussionrelated researchThe Hall of Fame has tiptoed past these issues and focused solely on players exploits in the gridironWere not the NFL but the Pro Football Hall of Fame said David Baker the executive director of the Hall Our mission is to honor the heroes of the game and Junior is a hero of the game Were going to celebrate his life not the death and other issuesSeaus former wife Gina was very surprised by the Hall of Fames policy to use only a video because she did not think Sydney or any of us were going to use the Hall of Fame as a platformHorrigan said the Seaus were given incorrect information about the ceremony before the Hall of Fame formally notified them of its policy on July 9 five months after they had learned Seau would be inductedAdvertisementBut Gina Seau said she did not question the Hall of Fames motives and in the end agreed the focus should be on Junior and his legacyIts already difficult enough as it is she saidThe familys dispute with the NFL was another matter After an autopsy showed that Junior Seau suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits Gina filed a wrongfuldeath suit against the league on behalf of Seaus two younger children Jake and Hunter Sydney and her brother Tyler who are adults joined the suit They are seeking the equivalent of what their father would have earned which could amount to several million dollarsThe case though was swept into the classaction suit brought by 5000 retired players In the settlement which is being appealed Gina could have received up to 4 million The Seaus opted out though because the settlement did not address the childrens claimsThe familys lawyer Steve Strauss said that the league had declined to negotiate and that he was told by a representative to take the deal The lawsuit should be separate from the settlement he said because Seaus children sued as heirs and are not party to the collective bargaining agreement between the players and the NFLProfiles of each player drafted in the first round in 1990 and videos of some of them discussing challenges they faced once their NFL careers endedStrauss has asked the federal judge overseeing the settlement to allow the Seau lawsuit to go forward in state court in California but the judge Anita B Brody has indicated that she wanted to rule on any optout cases collectively he saidWe want to move forward Strauss said We have waited two and a half yearsWhile the Seaus wait for a resolution to their case they continue to wonder whether they could have done more to recognize and maybe slow Juniors declineIn retrospect the signs of CTE were there the memory lapses the mood swings the suicidal tendenciesIn October 2010 Seau drove his sport utility vehicle off a cliff along the beach in Carlsbad Calif where it landed about 100 feet below Seau said he had fallen asleep but it came soon after he had been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence involving his girlfriendAdvertisementI didnt know the severity of it Gina said I didnt want to acknowledge what it was his first suicide attemptAfter their marriage ended years before Gina spoke regularly with Seau and when she called him a few months after the Carlsbad incident he seemed depressedHe said I had no idea how many hours are in a day the days are so long  she said That was a completely obvious statement of a man who was scared He had so many opportunities and he couldnt get there He was stuck in a bubbleSeaus family and many of his friends will travel to Canton for induction weekend lamenting that Seau a lively public speaker known for delivering upbeat messages and for poking fun at himself and the audience would not take the stage The Seau family is preparing for a bittersweet weekendIts been like planning a wedding party without the groom Gina

111,AdvertisementWith an increased focus on the dangers of football one Michigan high school decided to focus on the safety of the players on its outmanned varsity football team by canceling the final three games of its season this weekThe school Caro High School took this step Wednesday after its football roster was decimated by injuries including several concussions and four players quit in two weeks After a 530 loss to rival North Branch last Friday the coach went to school administrators and voiced his concerns about the players safety And after twothirds of the players voted in favor this week Mike Joslyn the Caro schools superintendent announced the decisionIts a difficult decision because our players were out there battling hard but were an educational institution and with our students safety comes first Joslyn said in a telephone interview Friday These kids have long lives ahead of them and we need to keep the brains in their heads intactAdvertisementJoslyn said Caros roster was so depleted that eight sophomores had been called up from the junior varsity Because so many freshmen had been moved up to the junior varsity the freshman season had already been canceled Todd Topham the varsity coach then began to worry that his players would be so overmatched by older players on opposing teams that the games could become more dangerous for themAdvertisementCaro with an enrollment of 524 students plays in the Class B TriValley Conference East and had gone 429 in the past four seasons It was 15 this seasonPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter to subscribe toView all New York Times newslettersJoslyn who played football at Caro High School and in college said the reaction from the community was mixedI would say the response has been about 5050 Joslyn said Half have thanked us for making a courageous decision The other people say you dont ever quit that kids are soft these days and need to get out there and battle I understand all of that but our kids were out there battling We made the best decision we couldJoslyn and Topham continue to have high hopes for the program Joslyn said especially because the sophomore class gained varsity experience this year They expect to field a full varsity team next seasonStill Joslyn said that while he thought the dangers of football were sensationalized and not different from any other contact sport he advocated more thought being put into player development His son he said plays youth footballIf you look around you see 6 and 7yearolds playing fullpad football he said We should be asking if kids are playing these sports too early before their brains are really developedGo to Home Page,football,"['advertisementwith',

113,B 1924And in scattering some 900 million socalled Chick tracts all over the world  his faithful readers were advised to tuck them under windshield wipers into clothes pockets at department stores even into the rental shoes at bowling alleys  Chick built a multimilliondollar publishing empire on works that sold for less than 20 cents apieceChick knew the precise moment when he made the transition from foulmouthed World War II veteran a wouldbe actor who doodled on the side to true believer It was a Sunday in 1948 and his new inlaws insisted that he listen to The Old Fashioned Revival Hour on the radio The host quoted a line from the Book of Isaiah  Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow  and Chick fell to his kneesAfter a decade of struggling to combine his artistic talent with his burning faith Chick struck upon an idea while giving a Gospel lesson to a group of inmates that incorporated a flip chart with his own illustrations Eventually that same artwork became his most famous tract published in 1964 This Was Your Life In it a man holding a drink drops dead and an angel whisks him to a celestial drivein theater where scenes from his past play before him that time he told a dirty story ogled a young woman ummm NICE wondered about the score of a ballgame while in church His sins are tallied and his name is not found in the Book of Life he is damned But an alternate ending is on offer Embrace Jesus and be rewarded with joyous eternity This Was Your Life is said to have been published more than 50 million times in Zulu Tagalog and more than a hundred other languagesBy the 1980s new works by Chick were appearing every couple of months They are classic forms of effective quickstrike storytelling every illustrated panel propelling the reader to the next as dramatic tension builds Just how far will the author go in rendering the wrath and mercy of God In Gun Slinger an Old West killer for hire goes to heaven after turning to Christ just before hes hanged while the marshal who captured him goes to hell for never having done the same In Lisa a man who has been molesting his young daughter is confronted by the family physician who  rather than call the police  invites the predator to pray for repentance All is forgivenChicks widely parodied works were intolerant paranoid Satanobsessed Angels includes a musical agent named Lew Siffer who says he controls billions of souls through rock n roll In the 50s and 60s I started gradually introducing my new beat into some of the crooners    at first it was nice and soft Then I gave them Elvis and the Beatles etc Dan Raeburn who published a zine The Imp about underground comics characterizes Chicks work as the dark heart of American fundamentalismBut Chicks soulwinning tracts as they were called also earned him recognition as a kind of undergroundcomics patriarch Raeburn once devoted an entire issue of The Imp to Chick Kurt Kuersteiner author of The Unofficial Guide to the Art of Jack T Chick describes his cartoons as an inspiration to countless artists who otherwise condemned his religious and conservative viewsYet those views appalled some religious bodies like the Christian Booksellers Association and the Catholic Church which took issue with Chicks frequent antiCatholic depictions including the claim laid out in The Awful Truth that the Jesuits were behind the assassination of Lincoln That conviction may underpin why in late middle age he came to suspect that his own life might be in danger In the end the creator behind religious tracts that were ubiquitous removed himself from public view so effectively that for decades only those closest to him even knew what he looked likeDan Barry is a national columnist for The New York Times and the author most recently of The Boys in the Bunkhouse Servitude and Salvation in the HeartlandB 1938B 1930There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14

114,B 1942Joe as he was named in reports had been up there for hours According to a police spokesman he seemed to think he was in Vietnam  with the Viet Cong coming at him A crowd gathered on the street below goading Joe to jump to his death Police officers a psychologist and a chaplain leaned out of a nearby window imploring him to come inside Im no good he shouted dangling his feet over the side whenever someone got too close Im going to jumpAlis best friend Howard Bingham was at the scene He called Ali who lived nearby About four minutes later Bingham later told reporters Ali comes driving up the wrong side of the street in his RollsRoyce with his lights blinkingYaro watched Ali run into the building and took photographs of what happened next One captures the fighter in a dark suit and tie his smooth face expressionless leaning out a window peering almost casually around a pillar to get a look at Joe Yards away Joe is balanced on a ledge one foot in front of the other gripping a pillar as he leans out over empty space The effect is nauseating In trying to get a better look at Ali Joes at risk of falling to his deathThe day Ali saved Joes life he had already begun to crumble He was five years removed from The Thrilla in Manila the fight against Joe Frazier that many believe irrevocably destroyed something inside him Back in October he fought his friend and former sparring partner Larry Holmes who gave him a beat down so vicious that Ali didnt come out for the 11th round afterward Holmes was reduced to tears In three short years Parkinsons would be diagnosed But as Robert Lipsyte  a former Times reporter who has spent much of his life chronicling Alis  remembers it Ali was still the most beautiful creature on the planetAli spent three and a half years of his athletic prime stripped of his boxing license for protesting the very war that haunted Joe Perhaps he felt a kinship with the vet Or perhaps it was something else One of the main things Lipsyte remembers about Ali was the narcissism the wanting to be loved the need for constant attention What kind of guy gets in his car and drives toward a potential suicide to save the life of a man he has never metThe answer of course is a guy who thinks himself a hero The one constant in Alis life  from the 12yearold boxer passing out fliers for his own fights to the man who withdrew from public life as Parkinsons took hold  was his unyielding nighoblivious selfbelief It was there in 1964 when a 22yearold named Cassius Clay called himself The Greatest before his championship bout against Sonny Liston and it was still there when he was ultimately dismantled by Holmes It wasnt just that his confidence informed his speed skill wit and beauty It was that his confidence made him a beacon People in need of strength could affix to him whatever symbolism they needed black pride the strength of protest the senselessness of war In turn Ali could energize themGreg Howard is a David

115,B 1947Crystal was born Jackie Diamond a welltodo girl from Westchester That life didnt suit her She was made for the East Village and she found her way there as soon as she could Back then in the late 60s the neighborhood was a world removed from Mad Men New York It was more of a downtown commune where apartments were passed around like spliffs It was the kind of place where you could knock on a neighbors door and ask to use her bathtub Or maybe only Crystal did thatWhile working at a shortlived psychedelic newspaper The East Village Other Diamond was rechristened Coca Crystal She took the name not because she particularly liked cocaine  she much preferred pot  but because she liked the alliteration the feel of it the playful mysticism the name impliedShe started If I Cant Dance in 1977 The show resembled a daffy dinner party hosted by your coolest aunt the one who let you sip a little wine when the grownups werent looking Though she interviewed the days icons  people like Cesar Chavez and Philip Glass  her reportorial bent was reliably offkilter she loved asking her guests what was in their refrigerators Debbie Harry of Blondie looked supremely stoned as she described the varieties of grape juice in hersIncredibly the show ran until 1995 Later episodes have her in full unreconstructed hippie garb  scraggly hair chunky sunglasses elaborately patterned vest  railing against Newt Gingrich and the Republicans  eye of Newt and tail of Quayle  It finally went off the air when publicaccess administrators tried to move her to the ungodly hour of 11 am on Friday Crystal refused read a TV bureaucrats phone number on the air with some curse words thrown in and retired her show for goodIn a sense Crystal saw where American culture was going Her show predicted the sensibility of the internet  nonlinear surreal personal casual satirical yet still passionately earnest But she didnt divulge everything to her audience Crystals viewers knew her as the ringmaster of a loopy circus but she spent much of her time offscreen caring for Gustav Che Finkelstein a nephew of hers who became her son She adopted Gus who was severely handicapped when he was a toddler in the 1970s and remade her life around him She even left Manhattan to move upstate so Gus would have more roomThroughout his childhood she drove into the city every Wednesday night Gus alongside her to record the show Her friends and costars would take turns sitting with Gus in the audience while she was on air Crystal always referred to Gus as her executive producer And after the show wrapped each week around midnight she would thank her misfit crew for coming out for another taping Then she and Gus would get back in the car and head north just the two of them for the long ride homeSam Dolnick

116,B 1950But as it turned out almost every transcendent moment across her fourdecade career would be somehow shadowed asteriskaffixed She was criticized as an Aretha Franklin soundalike who wasnt Aretha Franklin Or she was already pass a soul singer when the genre was being eclipsed by disco Or she was cashing in on her fathers legacy still just the daughter of And so her impressive early streak  three Grammys six consecutive gold or platinum albums and the riches they brought in  ended up leading her right back to drugs this time the LA cocaine culture It was like a damn dip for crackers she wrote in her memoir Angel on My Shoulder By the time she escaped in the early 80s her years as the base queen as she was known had cost her not one but two recording contracts her first marriage and almost her voice and son who fell into a pool while she was on a binge and was rescued by a couple who worked for her In her memoirs she claimed to have narrowly escaped death herself at least half a dozen times before she was 35From that point she stayed clean but sobriety didnt make her more riskaverse at least in terms of her career In 1991 she embarked on Unforgettable  With Love an album of songs her father had made famous mostly in the 1940s and 50s with lush period string and horn arrangements Anchored by the duet from the beyond with him on the title track he died in 1965 the very uncontemporary album was a way of both paying tribute to him and exorcising his ghost and a surprise runaway success besides eventually going seventimesplatinum and sweeping the Grammy Awards But as had become customary for Cole a backlash soon followed  how could this collection of ancient songs be best album in the year of Nirvana and NWA Though those songs were no more ancient then than many stillubiquitous Beatles Dylan and Stones tracks are today Partly because of Unforgettable  With Love the Grammy voting rules were changed essentially leading to the creation of a Grammy electoral college that reduced the influence of older voters A particularly stinging rebuke though may have been a Saturday Night Live skit titled Unforgivable in which Cole Ellen Cleghorne sings further spectral duets with the likes of Judy Garland Mike Myers and Mama Cass Chris FarleyColes passing announced on New Years Day was just the beginning of a cascade of musical loss even in death she was somewhat overshadowed and yet as one giant after another departed hers was still the music I craved most As I scanned the titles in my collection I was reminded how whether she was singing RB pop jazz or standards she left it all in the grooves There was the joy bomb of This Will Be the BowieFamelike groove of Sophisticated Lady only with sharper jabs and better footwork the scatting whoosh of Mr Melody and the sustained elegance of The Very Thought of You A sassy hit cover of Bruce Springsteens Pink CadillacBut the album I reached for first was Dangerous an obscure 1985 release and her first after she emerged from rehab Reviewing the record for a local paper at the time I youngly but not insincerely claimed that Cole was the best singer in pop music Thats a brave call said the editor but he wasnt buying it 1985 was the year of Whitney rising and a period of reascendance for Aretha Chaka Patti Tina The review never ran Listening to the album more than 30 years later I could hear how well forgettable the tracks were unworthy of the worst Brat Pack soundtrack Yet I was still struck by how Cole could be a vocal shoehorn able to slide meaningful phrases into even this synthy muck She had to know the material was beneath her yet she stared it down the way she stared down addiction or everyone who said she was nothing more than a knockoff Maybe I was on to something way back then Only now there was no asterisk in sightRob Hoerburger is the copy chief of the magazineB 1938B 1930There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14 capsule a ragged

117,B 1954The idea was to be accessible rather than rarefied  to show people how to personalize clothes and accessories not by reading fashion magazines but by experimenting Bellettinis sister Gina DeHerrera told me Alisa lived the same way She didnt feel that what you were wearing had to be expensive Her style was about mixing and matching and feeling incredible in it Pearl bracelet with a Swatch watch worn backward a Gap Tshirt with a designer blazer  she had an incredible knack of putting clothes together and looking genius in themHouse of Style rethought fashionmagazine dogmatism and democratized style but never too mockingly never too righteously It wasnt Style with Elsa Klensch but it wasnt Zoolander either Bellettini took this world seriously journalistically Her show spent segments unpacking the budgets of fashion shows and letting models explain their salaries It gave us Todd Time with Todd Oldham the dreamy young designer who made daffy videos about swimwear and taught us stuff like how to reupholster a chair The designers Karl Lagerfeld Vivienne Westwood Herve Leger and Martine Sitbon  they were all news to me House of Style equated the value of what they did with the value of what was going on in the clubs and on the streetsOldham told me that all of this  the shows happy offcenter insatiably curious personality its nonstop introductions and conflations  came straight from Bellettini A woman who had come into fashion television almost by happenstance created a show that expressed not just who she was but who some of us aspired to be Oldham remembered a laborintensive and expensively arty garment he once created one Bellettini took a shine to an elaborate embroidered and beaded skirt I made and put Mona Lisa on one side and a wonky thriftstore painting on the other Basically a 5000 joke But she wore it every day like jeans Bellettinis insouciance is what for Oldham made House of Style unique its honest assessment that style has nothing to do with money That he said was straight up AlisaWesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazineB 1938B 1930There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14 capsule a ragged cone of scorched metal and shredded foil bobbing in the South Pacific 880 miles off the coast of American Samoa A wetsuitclad Navy swimmer is helping him out of the access hatch and into an inflatable raft Mitchell dressed in an olivedrab flight suit and a biological mask steadies himself with his left hand on the door frame

out of places and objects  arranged to visit the living and working spaces of some of the monumental figures we lost this year The goal was to arrive not long after each persons death in those days

118,B 1962Miss Cleo was the star of a hotline company called the Psychic Readers Network which people called for relationship advice lottery numbers or answers to questions about their future She quickly found loyal fans She came to prominence in the late 1990s a time marked by high camp and an abundance of deliciously trashy daytime talkshow hosts like Ricki Lake and Maury Povich Everyone on TV back then was low on ethics and high on entertainment Her infomercials were a cross between a theater production and a scripted reality show a telethon for people suffering from heartbreak and in desperate need of wisdom People phoned in for Miss Cleos special brand of real talk She lectured people about new loves The ex is much better than the present one you know and cautioned against overtly pessimistic outlooks Dont make me take you to church young man She once untangled a paternity crisis by describing the shape of the babys chin In the nowunimaginable era before ondemand everything she was often the only thing worth watching after midnightBorn in Los Angeles Youree Dell Harris loved being in character Before her career as a television psychic according to The Seattle PostIntelligencer Harris produced and starred in several plays in the city Several former castmates described her as brilliant and talented but also deceptive Harris they said once skipped town after producing a show without properly paying her cast and crew In 1997 she met Steven Feder and Peter Stolz the Fort Lauderdale cousins behind the phone psychic company and agreed to represent their business as Miss Cleo a mystic shaman born in Jamaica In 2002 the Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit against the Psychic Readers Network for engaging in unfair and deceptive trade practices The company was forced to forgive 500 million in outstanding customer debts and pay a 5 million fine Not long after Harris parted ways from Feder and Stolz The disintegration of their partnership also dissolved Miss Cleo The Psychic Readers Network created the Cleo character and they controlled how she could use itShe released a CD of spokenword poems Convicted for My BeliefsNot that Harris wanted to keep up the ruse People saw her as a thief and a con artist She later admitted she never expected people to take the commercials seriously If the truth was there in black and white she said wiping away tears in a 2014 documentary called Hotline surely people would have sense But thats not the way it goes Although she confessed that she wasnt a psychic she insisted she had studied under a female high priestess in Voodoo for 30 years But by the time of the documentary she was already well into the new phase of her identity In 2006 she came out as a lesbian in an interview with The Advocate She was raising two daughters from previous relationships and officiating at weddings and performing cleansings on houses She wrote a spiritual guidebook and she even had a podcastThe media business dynamics that made Miss Cleo a household name no longer exist Miss Cleo has no heirs just pixelated relics on YouTube Her closest kin is a Bcelebsponsored post on Instagram but flattummy tea doesnt have the same charm Miss Cleo may have started off as a joke but her character grew into a legend She voiced a character in Grand Theft Auto Vice City and was referenced in skits by Dave Chappelle and on Mad TV She was briefly a spokeswoman for Benefit Cosmetics She predated the Kardashians in understanding the importance of a personal brand and the power of a platformJenna Wortham is a staff

131,FeatureRecruits at Parris Island have been subjected to severe hazing far beyond that experienced in other US military boot camps Is this really the only way to create a warriorSupported bySilenceRaheel she said The phone was dead The call lasted less than five seconds In her darkened living room in Taylor Mich a suburb of Detroit Ghazala worried The previous morning Raheel a 20yearold Marine Corps recruit left for boot camp on Parris Island SC He had promised to call his parents when he arrived and Ghazala and her husband Masood had been waiting by the phone But the call when it came was strange with an almost deafening noise in the background Ghazala couldnt be sure it was even him In the morning she phoned Raheels recruiter No one knows my sons voice better than me she said That didnt sound like my sonThe Siddiquis who emigrated from Pakistan in the 1990s hadnt wanted their precious oldest child and only boy to join the Marines Slender and unathletic Raheel had always seemed most content designing video games on his computer He graduated ninth in the class of 2014 from Taylors Harry S Truman High School a valedictorian with his pick of colleges including a full academic scholarship to Michigan State After months of deliberation he decided on the University of Michigans Dearborn campus where he enrolled in September 2014 lured by its new program in robotics engineering But the following July after his freshman year Raheel drastically changed course announcing to his family that he had decided to leave college and enlist in the MarinesGhazala didnt understand Youre smart youre intelligent  why she pleaded with him Raheel tried to placate her It was a golden opportunity he told his parents After three years in the Marine Corps I can do anythingThat call was the last time she heard her sons voiceRaheel was raised in public housing and spent his high school years intent on escaping his shabby hometown He always wanted challenges says Jerry Abraham a former guidance counselor at Truman High whom Raheel frequently enlisted to help him find the hardest classes In pursuit of a perfect GPA Raheel had virtually no social life though he had a nave optimism unusual for a teenager He saw the world as nothing but a wonderful place says Karey Lee Raheels supervisor at a nearby Home Depot where he worked part time on the customerservice desk I dont think he knew that hatefulness existed to be honestMilitary recruiters were fixtures at Truman High The Marines the most selective of the armed services came to campus twice a week They targeted the kids that were more collegeoriented and capable of being successful says Abraham whose office was in the same building as the schools ROTC program They were also quick to reject students who failed to meet their standards which include scores in the top third on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Asvab test and no history of serious drug use crime or tattoos that the Marines consider undesirable Like many of his classmates Raheel took the Asvab and scored high With his talents drive and rigid focus he would very likely have struck recruiters as the golden goose as one former Marine put itThe University of MichiganDearborn was the most prestigious school to which Raheel applied and in April 2014 he was accepted and given a 2000 scholarship It was not the full academic scholarship he was offered by Michigan State but with the hefty financial aid he would receive it was technically a full free ride Raheel announced on Facebook The assistance however came with strings Should his grades dip below a C average he wouldnt receive any more money until they went back upRaheel enrolled in Michigans honors program a special track requiring students to maintain a 32 GPA He assumed it would be easy Lee his boss at Home Depot estimated that Raheel probably worked about 20 hours a week his freshman year though it never occurred to her to ask why he needed to work so many hours if school was paid for He never talked about what he did with the money she says I assumed he was doing well at school because I mean he was a geniusAfter high school Raheel had told his mother she should stop working odd jobs and let him contribute to the familys income Massood didnt make much at an autoparts factory and Raheel was concerned about how the family would pay for his 16yearold sister to attend college Lets face it he confided to a friend shes not going to get a full scholarship and my parents cant afford to send her so I have to make sure she goesIt was a lot for an 18yearold His grades began to suffer By December Raheel was getting Cs Worried that he might fail chemistry he texted his friend Nathan Pykor also a student at the Dearborn campus I just feel too STRESSED over all of my classes because I havent dedicated enough timeYoure fine Pykor who had known Raheel since high school replied You know that its nearly impossible to get a 40 in collegeIm not fine Raheel texted backHis solution he told Pykor was to withdraw from his classes and start fresh in the spring which he did finishing the semester with three As and a B But as Pykor told me withdrawing from his classes very likely meant Raheel would owe the University of Michigan the money it had given him to attend classes in the fall It also could have jeopardized his aid package for the following yearOn June 16 2015 Raheel posted on Facebook for the first time in a while Im thinking about joining the military Maybe the Marines Just three weeks later on July 8 he signed his enlistment papers and entered the Marines Delayed Entry Program which lasting anywhere between a month and a year is designed to stagger the number of recruits the corps can train at any one time Its also intended to indoctrinate poolees as they are called into the culture of the Marines The DEP is all about selling the KoolAid says a lance corporal who also enlisted in the Marines in 2015 after his freshman year I decided I didnt like college enough to justify all that debt he told me You meet every Saturday and theyll tell you stories do little workouts he says tell you some lies Like  Yeah Im always in my room playing Xbox Theres all this time to party   anything that will appeal to college kidsRaheel spent close to eight months in the DEP under the tutelage of his recruiter who the Siddiquis said told them that Raheel was his most motivated poolee Ghazala marveled at the changes in her son who now woke each day at 4 am to spend hours at the gym Any doubts his mother had about his education were assuaged by Raheels own assurances He said he had been told that he could continue his education while serving and that having chosen a technical specialty working on Marine aircraft he might not even have to fight unless he wanted to In fact Marines I spoke to said it was nearly impossible to pursue an education during their first enlistment once deployed every Marine has to be prepared to fight if suddenly under attack At Raheels urging Ghazala visited the recruiting office in Taylor where she says that recruiters assured her that Raheels safety wouldnt be an issueI feel like theyre really good at lying says the lance corporal who was sold on the corps by recruiting videos that presented the Marines as badasses on humanitarian missions to save refugees or deliver food and water Raheel told his parents that enlisting in the Marines would put him on the fast track to join the FBI which to their total surprise had become his lifes dream A few weeks before he left for boot camp Raheel stopped by Truman to tell some of his old teachers about his plans Abraham pressed him on his decision but Raheels mind was made upBe careful Raheels friend Hussein Chehab who worked with him at Home Depot says he told him before he left Just    watch yourself You dont know what kinds of people are down there You dont know how other people thinkHistory or what Marines call knowledge lives on Parris Island Everything about the place is an elegy to the corps from the statue of Marines lifting the flag on Iwo Jima to the street names each one its own small lesson Boulevard de France Cuba Street Wake Boulevard Saigon Drive Inside the Recruit Chapel a series of stainedglass windows depicts chapters of Marine heroism and sacrifice In one a platoon of Marines rests in the hand of God In another a ragtag band of soldiers and sailors stands before the gates of heaven guarded by stoic crisply dressed MarinesThe Marines are Americas smallest conventional military force with just 184000 activeduty troops They are also the militarys most insular warriors  with the possible exception of Navy SEALs  whose tight bond or esprit de corps grows out of the codes traditions and reverence for suffering that Marines believe set them apart from civilians and all other military branchesCentral to this identity is the uniquely miserable experience of boot camp where since World War II as the historian Aaron OConnell writes in his 2012 book Underdogs The Making of the Modern Marine Corps Recruits have learned in ways they would not forget that what made Marines exceptional was their ability to endure more pain than members of their sister services Making Marines as the corps calls recruit training is a threepart process with boot camp being the first and most grueling test Its purpose unlike Army boot camp is not to train warfighters for Marines that comes in the second and third phases of training Boot camp is meant to create the warrior spirit as the corps puts it over three months of group indoctrination intended to strip recruits of individuality and through repeated exposure to pain and physical challenge condition them to accept and perform violenceIn his 1984 memoir First to Fight the esteemed Marine lieutenant general Victor Krulak known as Brute spoke of the almost mystical alchemy that happens during boot camp whose shared hardships he saw as the genesis of the enduring sense of brotherhood that characterizes the corps But the lines between hard training and abuse can blur Like every other branch of the military the Marine Corps has official strictures against hazing which it defines as any unauthorized verbal or physical conduct of a cruel abusive humiliating oppressive demeaning or harmful nature The Marines have nonetheless investigated hundreds of hazing allegations in the past five years alone The particulars of the hazing incidents in this article were taken largely from redacted reports prepared by the Marines in the course of their investigations Details like names and dialogue were provided by eyewitnesses and other recruits There is a natural tension between an organization that trains people for lethality and the larger culture a Marine reserve officer told me Inside the culture youre supposed to be able to take a punch and give a punch and crush a skull Outside this is not something thats valuedThe bedrock of Marine tradition is a longago era when buff male and mostly white combat Marines launched amphibious earlymorning assaults on enemy beaches armed with M1 rifles and KaBar knives Todays far less homogeneous troops roll into battle in armored Humvees or tanks with sophisticated highpowered weaponry and thermalimaging goggles Many never leave their base at all waging war remotely while operating a joystick or writing code In many ways the Marines have become indistinguishable from the ArmyAdapting to these harsh truths hasnt been easy for the corps whose current and former officials with some exceptions were reluctant to speak openly about these challenges except on condition of anonymity The Marines have a purpose and its a militant purpose one senior officer says We are an organization grounded on the physical but wars are not as physical anymore The character of war has evolved a lot from the early 20th century The question is Has our force evolved I dont think it hasOnce inside the doors the mystical journey from civilian to Marine known as the Transformation begins Its pandemonium Drill instructors scream from every direction as the kids scrambling to individual metal desks are ordered to fill out administrative paperwork signaling their completion by raising their right hand with pen above their heads From there its on to the phone bank where with instructors bawling at them to finish recruits are told to make three or foursecond calls home reading as fast as they can from a fiveline script taped to the phone boxThe rest of the intake process known as receiving follows over the next few days buzz cuts boots uniforms shots They are given physicalfitness tests fed what most describe as truly awful food and ordered to perform seemingly meaningless tasks like standing at attention while holding their heavy gear in front of them until their arms give out or sitting crosslegged and motionless on the floor for hours Some Marines I interviewed recalled being kept awake for nearly two days after arriving All you can think about is sleep one said Those are the main tools fear and sleep deprivationDrill instructors or DIs are revered on Parris Island where they roam the base with a special aura Nobody will counter them one senior Marine official told me Without them there is no Parris Island Some DIs are not much older than the recruits Only a small fraction have been to war Almost all adopt the mien of an infantry grunt though in truth most DIs like most Marines arent combat troops but rather part of the corpss expanding cast of supporting players mechanics air traffic controllers technicians clerks Some Marines I spoke with described boot camp as a performance The lead actors are the DIs men and women who for the first time in their professional lives are embodying the macho warrior archetype they were taught to venerate as recruitsTo qualify for DI training a Marine must have finished at least one term of enlistment and be given a clean psychological bill of health as determined by what the Marine officials insist is rigorous testing aimed at weeding out those Marines suffering from PTSD They must also complete an 11week drillinstructor school where as one former officer puts it they are taught to mold these guys into killers DI school by all accounts is almost as intense as boot camp This is by design every moment of a drill instructors schedule is tightly scripted and charted on what the corps calls its training matrix The system is very unforgiving on the DI says Gary Lee a retired Marine sergeant major who helped design the training program in 1995 They never get a break from their responsibilities During a 12week training cycle DIs spend almost all their time on their feet Their voices croak with exhaustion and strain They barely sleepThe stress of the job coupled with the nearunbridled power given to drill instructors creates a dangerous alchemy This has been particularly true on Parris Island whose violent shadow culture as it has been described to me exceeds San Diegos Since 2014 there have been 24 official hazing investigations on Parris Island half of them substantiated There is a perspective on the base that somehow you can make a better Marine by beating the shit out of him says the retired Marine general Charles Krulak Brute Krulaks son I have argued consistently that its not true  you do not make a better Marine by treating them that way in fact its totally against what we as a Marine Corps stand for But its a mentality that has existed down there for so longIn 1995 Charles Krulak became the commandant of the Marine Corps and decided this culture had to change Krulak and his team came up with what they called the transformation process which overhauled boot camp to incorporate an agenda based on the Marines core values  honor courage commitment  into every aspect of basic training The goal Krulak says was to create a smarter more selfless more adept and more educated Marine It channeled the violence of Marine Corps training into specific moments the most important being the Crucible a grueling 54hour physical and psychological endurance test that comes at the end of the training cycle and was intended as the final and in Krulaks mind only arbiter of whether a recruit is ready to become a MarineThe transformation process managed to curtail hazing for a few years says Krulak who retired from the corps in 1999 As I recall the number of courtsmartial had a significant decrease during those four or five years when I was commandant Problem was after I left we had a changing world I think in all these years of war we lost a bit of our focus he says There are people who think war entitles them to behave any way they wantAs new waves of recruits passed through Parris Island after Sept 11 the Marines rushed to meet the demands for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan Some of the reforms Krulak had put in place began to erode Without the structure to support them it was easy for some drill instructors to fall back on the violent methods they themselves experienced at boot camp In 2005 a film crew from a South Carolina TV station inadvertently caught a terrifiedlooking recruit named Jason Tharp being hit by a drill instructor at the Parris Island pool The following day Tharp drowned during watersurvival training his drill instructor was charged with negligent homicide and later acquitted In 2011 a Parris Island drill instructor was sent to the brig for more than a year after he was found guilty of ordering one of his recruits to record a video of himself masturbating on the DIs cellphone The next year a trainee received second and thirddegree burns to his buttocks requiring skin grafts after his drill instructor ordered him to perform unauthorized exercises under an upsidedown laundry bin on a floor covered in bleach according to Marine Corps documents The DI was courtmartialed in 2014 having been turned in by his senior DI who himself would later be courtmartialed for ordering his platoon into the showers and making them run in place while thickening the air by pouring bleach down the drain After these stories broke some Marines recalled the routine nature of such punishments and how infrequently they were ever brought to light Reporting it would have gotten nowhere a onetime Parris Island recruit who claimed that he was made to scrub the floors with pure bleach wrote in a Reddit thread in 2014 I saw too much other stuff get swept under the rugIn June 2014 Lt Col Kate Germano arrived at Parris Island to head up the Fourth Battalion which trains the corpss female recruits She found a culture badly in need of reform Two of her female drill instructors were facing courtsmartial for mistreating recruits and in one case abusing other lowerranking drill instructors a phenomenon known as hat hazing Abuses toward the recruits included ethnic slurs socalled hard corrections like pushing and shoving and refusing to give recruits bathroom breaks Germano who spent 2004 and 2005 as an adjutant and Marine Corps legal officer in Iraq was so alarmed that she decided to give her subordinates a PowerPoint presentation on Abu Ghraib I saw a direct similarity between the culture in both places she saysGermano believed that much of the failure rested with the depots regimental commander Col Daniel Haas who had been at Parris Island since July 2013 The Marines declined to make Colonel Haas available for a response Haas had a remote leadership style  not the type of guy that will care and feed you one of his other battalion commanders later said  that clashed with Germanos more handson approach which included impromptu walkthroughs and counseling her subordinates to demand more of the female recruits to help them compete effectively with their male counterparts While many of her Marines made changes others perceived Germano as meddlesomeIn April 2015 less than a year after coming to Parris Island and 11 months before Raheels arrival Germano received the results of the battalions annual Command Climate Survey in which lowerranking officers and noncommanding officers evaluate their commanders In her survey Germanos subordinates described her as hostile unprofessional and abusive Though Germano maintains she was none of those things the commanding general of Parris Island relieved her of her command following an investigationIsolated in a remote corner of the depot the Third had long been a rogue fief on Parris Island its silent pact with Marine officialdom being that it would create the most disciplined recruits but would do so in its own way It had operated in this manner for more than 60 years and even in the era of valuesbased training the Third was virtually unchangedIn 1998 a Navy chaplain Thomas Creely now retired came to Parris Island to serve as chaplain for the recruit training regiment and noticed a particularly stark pattern of abuse in the Third For example he later wrote in a paper presented to the International Society for Military Ethics after lunch recruits were made to drink water until they vomited Then they were made to do pushups in their own vomit Creely worked with the command until 2003 to try to eradicate the problem but the blind loyalty of drill instructors who remained silent in the face of abuse stood in the way What you have in the Third Battalion is a cycle of abuse Creely told me recently And until that cycle is broken it doesnt matter how much education you doLt Col Joshua Kissoon who commanded the Third Battalion while Germano was on the base was a bythebook Marine who publicly took a hard stance against hazing Shortly after assuming command he instituted a zerotolerance policy on the touching of recruits by their DIs and put his staff on warning Any violation of the rules would be investigated Between 2013 and 2015 221 preliminary hazing investigations were conducted across the depots four battalions 69 of those were from the Third and more were punished from that battalion than any other This included three DIs who were recommended for courtsmartial after an investigation first reported by Wade Livingston at The Beaufort Gazette in February 2015 revealed a staggering level of misconduct and recruit abuse with recruits reporting that they were choked kicked and punched in the face and that they had their heads slammed against wallsSome junior officers felt the DIs were being punished unfairly though they themselves were never in the squad bays One later said his presence in the barracks undermines the drill instructors When Colonel Kissoon received the results of his own Command Climate Survey in April 2015 they were not much better than Germanos That spring Kissoon began to take a softer line in some cases according to Marines in the battalion On his desktop his subordinates later said he kept a redacted copy of the command investigation that led to Germanos firing This could happen to me he told colleaguesIt was into this environment of inconsistent decision making as some of Kissoons officers put it that a new group of Third Batallion recruits landed in April 2015 Most were straight out of high school A few had been college students Two had masters degrees Another had been living in his car All now learned their survival depended on how they handled the cognitive dissonance between what they learned as official Marine Corps policy and how that policy was systematically ignoredJake Weaver then 19 a new member of Platoon 3054 Lima Company recalls that when he met his DIs they gave him and his fellow recruits a choice You want to be trained like Marines right Not like crappy individual MarinesIndividualism was a sign of what the DIs called the new corps a place where everyone can walk through and become a Marine Weaver recalls and drill instructors couldnt get away with what they used to Theyd convince us to feel like it was wrong to be trained by the book he says and if we wanted to be trained right the oldschool way we had to let them beat us and haze us and not say anything because thats how you become a MarineWeaver who grew up in rural Interlachen Fla was the grandson of a Marine who fought in the Korean War His senior drill instructor was a squarely built Marine who told his recruits hed served in Iraq He also claimed he was involved in a friendlyfire incident in which 10 Marine infantrymen were killed though most officials I spoke with say the story is doubtful There wasnt an incident in that whole war where you had 10 or 12 people killed in one swoop Krulak told me As Weaver saw it his DI behaved like a person with PTSD He lost his temper like crazy Some days hed be supermotivating toward us he says and then an hour later wed be almost done for the day and hed walk in the squad bay and just flip outDuring the day platoons were put through the standard exhaustive physical and tactical training interspersed with classes or informal discussions on moral courage in battle But the real making of Marines went on at night When darkness fell a DI would sometimes dump a bottle of Gain detergent on the floor and order recruits both hands on their wooden scrub or scuzz brushes to run across the length of the squad bay in a bearcrawl position an exercise that they timed and called the Indy 500 Other nights the drill instructors would create what they called a hurricane by dumping everyones things on the floor sometimes covered with detergent sunscreen or shaving cream Over the months recruits in the battalion lost consciousness were revived and never told a soul A few developed lifethreatening rhabdomyolysis a rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue often caused by overexertionGunnery Sgt Joseph Felix was one of Lima Companys most aggressive DIs Recruits knew to be scared of Felix even those like Weaver who werent in his platoon He was pretty frickin psycho one Marine recalls Felix a swaggering man with a shaved head enlisted in 2002 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan working as a crew chief maintaining aircraft and their weapons systems He talked about his resentment toward Muslims whom he blamed for killing some of his friends in the war Felixs lawyer did not respond to requests for comment Ameer Bourmeche a Muslim recruit from Brooklyn and Weavers platoonmate soon became Felixs target I remember him calling Bourmeche a terrorist  recalls the recruit in Platoon 3054 who asked not to be identified He used to mess with him Where are the WMDs Were you part of 911 Though Bourmeche who declined to comment for this article never talked about his faith to anyones recollection the platoon was made aware of it during their first week of training when one of their drill instructors polled the group on their religions Weaver thought it was strange He was giving us this talk about how were all brothers in the Marine Corps and how were all in this together no matter what race or religion we are Then he was asking us What religions do we have here Im sure we have Christians Im sure we have an atheist Im sure youre a Baptist  He looked at Bourmeche Whats your religionIslam sir Bourmeche repliedThe sergeant seemed intrigued Theres nothing wrong with recruit Bourmeche being a Muslim he saidLess than onefifth of 1 percent of the Marine Corps is Muslim Across the entire United States military there are fewer than 6000 selfreported Muslim activeduty and reserve troops or about 027 percent out of a total force of 22 million Many of the recruits had never met a Muslim in their lives I was pretty narrowminded when I came in one of Bourmeches platoonmates admits I was like Why is he here Bourmeche seemed to be singled out nearly every day for punishment He was one of the smartest kids in the platoon scored really high on all his tests but they just messed with him Weaver says He remembers Bourmeche twice being sent to the medical unit after punitive intensive training sessions intended his friends figured to force him to drop out He refused In early July Platoon 3054 took part in their final 54hour test the Crucible grinding through 90degree heat Each recruit finished the course and earned the precious eagle globe and anchor pins and the title MarineOn July 14 2015 Felix and several other DIs entered the squad bay in the middle of the night It appeared theyd been drinking in the small office or DI hut at the far end of the barracks where drill instructors on night duty sometimes slept Felix was so drunk he might not have known what he did the next day according to one member of Platoon 3054Wheres the terrorist Felix said He approached Bourmeches rack You a terroristNo sirYou a MuslimYes sirAttentionBourmeche jumped downColumn left Felix and another DI marched him into the shower room where as Bourmeche would later tell investigators the drill instructors turned on the water and made him do pushups highknees and crunches Then when he was thoroughly wet they marched him into the laundry roomGet in the dryer Bourmeche folded his sixfoot 157pound frame into the Speed Queen Felix said that the Marine Corps has a way of weeding out spies He continued Im going to find out who you really are Then he closed the doorWho are you working for Felix calledNobody sir Bourmeche answeredFelix ran the dryer for half a minute and opened itWhats your religionIslam sirIn the squad bay Weaver and the others ordered out of their beds were pushing a recruit around like a scuzz brush They heard Bourmeches body thud as it hit the bottom of the dryer Youre going to kill us the first chance you get arent you terrorist What are your plansInside the dryer Bourmeche began to cry His neck and shoulder were burnedFelix opened the door Are you still a MuslimYes sirA half an hour later it was over Bourmeche damp and shaken was told to go back to the squad bay As he was standing by his bed a DI approached him Its pretty effedup what they did to you back there he said Bourmeche agreed Youre not going to tell a senior drill instructor about this though rightNo sir Bourmeche answeredThe next night it happened again Felix told Bourmeche to hand him his martialarts belt He tied Bourmeches shoelaces together then took the belt wrapped it around Bourmeches neck strung it under his laces and tightened it so Bourmeche bent at the waist Are you a terrorist Felix held the end of the belt like a leash He began to walk him like a dog Are you a spyBourmeche in pain began screaming No sirYell Allah akbar Allah akbarWhile the rest of the platoon looked on Felix crushed the platoons flagpole into Bourmeches toes Then he handed him a scuzz brush Cut off his head he said pointing to another new Marine Show us youre a terroristBourmeche struck his platoonmate in the neck with the brush several times Felix seemed pleased This is how the Taliban would do it he told the platoon And hed cut your head off just as quick as his brethrenAnother DI shook his head We let a fullblood terrorist join the corps he said Afterward no one said a word What happens on Parris Island stays on Parris Island  that had been the message all through boot campWeaver one of the platoons highestperforming recruits was shaken During a family picnic just before his graduation he told his parents that crazy stuff happened during training I cant talk about it here he said nervously After we get off the island we can talk about itOver the next few months Weaver tried to push what he experienced to the back of his mind but it was always there He had believed the Marines was an ethical organization Then a DI bashed his head against a wall for seemingly no reason And another after asking if he was a devout Christian taunted him Say goddamn  That fall Weaver then in his last phase of training in Pensacola Fla suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized with suicidal thoughtsHaving lost his desire to serve he received word he was being given an otherthanhonorable discharge from the Marines His father Troy decided to phone his commanding officer and tell her what he knew The fact is the abuse would have never been reported had I not stood up and said Look youre not going to give him a bad discharge because of what he went through at Parris Island  Troy told me Those kids werent talking Weaver was given an otherthanhonorable discharge which he continues to contestOn Nov 5 2015 Marine officials on Parris Island began an investigation into allegations of abuse based on statements Weaver Bourmeche and another former recruit from Platoon 3054 had given their commanding officer Weaver claims the investigators spent only 10 minutes talking to him Kissoon through his lawyer maintains that during this period Col Paul Cucinotta who had replaced Haas as regimental commander in the summer of 2015 refused to brief him on the inquiry as it was unfolding Internal Marine reports later described the investigation as suboptimalWhen the investigators submitted their findings to Cucinotta in January 2016 the training regiments executive officer Lt Col Christopher Lynch found the evidence persuasive enough to recommend that those involved be sat down or suspended from their duties Cucinotta later claimed he agreed We disagree with Colonel Cucinottas testimony says Kissoons attorney Colby Volkey As of February however none of those implicated in the investigation had been suspended Four months after the hazing reports Gunnery Sgt Joseph Felix returned to the Third Battalion and assumed the title of senior drill instructor this time for Platoon 3042 Kilo CompanyAs the recruits sat crossedlegged Sergeant Felix stepped forward I am your senior drill instructor he said with the signature barking cadence DIs use to exert their authority and then began his scripted pledge He promised to treat them with firmness fairness dignity and compassion and informed them that abuse would not be toleratedThere wasnt anything particularly unusual about that first day The new recruits were ordered to perform hundreds of burpees They were told to dangle their rifles off the ends of their pinkies They were dogpiled into a corner and then ordered to run back and forth over and over One of Raheels platoonmates who shared with me his detailed recollections on the condition of anonymity thought he was going to pass out And I was in pretty good shape he says I remember one kid had a panic attack and started throwing up and I think he peed himself too The officers stood in the back of the squad bay he says When they left thats when the real hell startedOn the morning of March 13 less than 24 hours after being picked up by his platoon Raheel announced to his DIs that hed rather die than continue training He would jump out the squadbay window if he had toWhen a recruit threatens suicide everything stops At first the DIs tried to reason with Raheel What would his mother think were he to come home without becoming a Marine Id tell my mother goodbye and kill myself he said The future does not matter The Marines took Raheels belt and boot laces to prevent him from strangling himselfSuicide threats are common during the early weeks of boot camp though how many are serious is unclear Everyone knows saying youre suicidal is a ticket off Parris Island Raheels platoonmate says Sickness or broken bones on the other hand will get a recruit a long stint in medical after which they will simply be assigned to another company and start training all over againBase officials determined Raheel didnt qualify for emergency transport to the hospital Instead he was crossdecked They moved him still without laces or a belt to another platoons squad bay Over the next 24 hours he sat there crosslegged on a mattress in the middle of the room while a shadow watch of recruits shined a flashlight on his face and took turns monitoring him around the clock At some point during this period Raheel who had to request permission to leave the mattress to use the bathroom recanted his suicide threat and said hed decided he wanted to be a MarineThe next morning Felix escorted Raheel to recruit liaison services an office set up to ascertain if recruits had enlisted fraudulently such as by failing to disclose a history of suicidal ideation and to motivate struggling recruits to return to training Drill instructors who accompany recruits to these sessions usually sit in a waiting area but Felix stood about 10 feet away according to the report while Raheel provided what was referred to as a voluntary statement retracting his threat This recruit thought it was the only way to quit he said This recruit never meant that and regrets it The bases mentalhealth unit deemed him to be at a low risk for harm and Raheel went back to trainingIt would be noted later in the Marines report that Raheel shortly after saying he wanted to kill himself confided to the military police who were going to escort him to the hospital that he could not handle being hit by his drill instructors The allegation was noted and disregarded several times by what appeared to be several officialsIn reviewing the incidents of that week the Marines made no mention of the four days after Raheel resumed training His platoonmate though recalls them as torture As one report noted Platoon 3042s senior drill instructor taught his subordinate drill instructors that in order to be successful at training recruits they needed to hate recruits  They were called bitches faggots maggots little bitches pussies and retards A Russianborn recruit was called the Russian or the cosmonaut and was asked if he was a Russian spy Raheel was called a terrorist Felix asked on one occasion if he needed his turbanRaheels platoonmate didnt understand why Raheel had joined the Marines Orders seemed to confound him Rather than simply following them he thought about what he was asked Like a normal person the platoonmate says Its not necessarily wrong but its not how they wanted it It wasnt the Marine way of doing things This earned Raheel who always looked like a scared animal as his platoonmate says undue attention from the DIs Anything thats not masculine  if youre not six feet tall and built like a football player  thats not what they want They want people who are the definition of Marines Anyone else you have to prove yourselfOnce the platoonmate recalls Felix stuffed a recruit in a footlocker Another time he made a recruit eat nothing but JellO and mashed potatoes for a few days and threatened that if he didnt improve hed have to stuff him in a locker too Choking recruits until they were gasping for air was common Some of the DIs the platoonmate suspected were almost as terrified of their senior DI as the recruits were One drill instructor he recalled became so ill that he projectilevomited all over the squad bay while simultaneously yelling at the recruits after he himself had been screamed at by Felix moments before We never knew if it was blood or Gatorade but hes vomiting this red stuff while screaming and we were like What is going onOn March 17 Platoon 3042 received instruction on Marine Corps mixedmartialarts punching techniques According to the Marines report recruits in Lima Company were instructed to throw a flurry of punches as hard as they could and not to listen to their instructors directions but instead just to keep punching It was routine recruits later said for their drill instructors to pair bigger or stronger recruits against the weaker or poorly performing recruits During the March 17 drill recruits were punched repeatedly in unprotected parts of their body including their jaws One sustained two broken ribs The abuse according to the report caused one recruit to cry during the event The platoonmate believed one of the targeted recruits was Raheel but he cant be sure Its really all a blur he says It was only Day 4 Many recruits didnt even know one anothers names Terror caused them to avoid making eye contact Lots of stuff happened while we slept he says Or in the darkAt around 2 am on March 18 Raheel woke up his bunkmate He was in pain he said Were all in pain the other recruit told him Two hours later the recruits awoke and prepared to sound off before leaving for chow Raheel pointed to his throat and silently mouthed words When two DIs started yelling at him Raheel handed one of them a note This recruit has to go to medical This recruits throat has been swollen for three days and is getting worse it said This recruit also coughed blood a few times last night And this recruit completely lost his voice and can barely whisper This recruits whole neck is in a lot of painA DI told Raheel they would deal with the matter after breakfast He sat silently through the meal zombielike Upon returning to the barracks the platoon set about cleaning and Raheel was called to the front of the squad bay He was supposed to fill out a form so he could go to the medical unit He stood before Felix but failed to greet him properly perhaps because he couldnt speak His silence seemed to enrage the senior drill instructor Get back he shouted Raheel ran 144 feet across the squad bay from one end to the other Siddiqui run Felix continued Get back RunHis platoonmate who had been quietly making his bed and trying to stay out of the DIs line of sight watched Raheel running back and forth Suddenly Raheel grabbed his throat crying and fell to the floor Some recruits thought he was faking I dont know if he did it willingly I dont know if he was just exhausted but he dropped the platoonmate saysGet up Siddiqui Felix shouted I know youre faking Get upAt this point reports differ Raheel appeared to be unconscious A DI claimed he rubbed his knuckles across Raheels sternum to revive him Other recruits and drill instructors say that never happened The platoonmate I interviewed recalls seeing Raheel on the floor clutching his throat Leaning over Felix slapped him across the face Five feet away Raheels platoonmate thought at first the DI was acting like an emergency responder trying to revive him But then he slapped him again so hard that the sound echoed across the squad bayAnd Siddiqui gets up and he starts dead sprinting which I thought was a logical thing to do This is boot camp hes running away his platoonmate says But he was running too fast He is literally sprinting the fastest Id ever seen anyone sprint he says Slowly it dawned on him what Raheel was about to do We were all still cleaning kind of dispersed around the squad bay The doors he recalls were open And he straightup jumpedAn air ambulance was requested to take Raheel to a hospital in Savannah Ga 40 miles away but the request was denied because of heavy fog A second air lift was scuttled and so Marines drove him to Beaufort Memorial Hospital where after an hour of sustained effort in the emergency room doctors decided Raheel needed higherlevel care Three hours after his fall he arrived at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston It was too late At 1006 after more than an hour of attempts to save his life Raheel was pronounced deadThe following day an autopsy was performed at the hospital The medical examiner concluded that Raheel died of bluntforce trauma sustained during his fall But the autopsy report details of which were shown to me by the Siddiqui family also found evidence of petechial hemorrhaging which can be caused by anything from heavy coughing to vomiting or asphyxiation and strangulation Several days later J Edward Allen the Beaufort County coroner wrote a final autopsy report concluding that in light of the history provided and the autopsy findings Raheel had committed suicideA week after Raheel died his body was sent back to his parents in Michigan At the funeral home the family stared down in horror at their son His arms chest stomach and legs were purple There were ligature marks not unlike the ridges of a webbed military belt around his neck which had not been mentioned in the autopsy report To Ghazala it looked as if her son had been torturedIn Beaufort a city with three military installations that collectively pump over 15 billion into the local economy the news that a Marine recruit had died on Parris Island was met with studied silence Marine Corps boot camp isnt the Boy Scouts one reader posted on the Facebook page of The Beaufort Gazette which broke the story on March 20 Stay home if you cant handle some hazing Hazing had not been mentioned publicly at this point but in Detroit the Siddiquis Democratic congresswoman Representative Debbie Dingell heard through an anonymous tip that religious bias might have played a role in Raheels death In April Dingell wrote to the Marine commandant Gen Robert Neller asking that an unbiased inquiry be made into the matter Dingell recently told me that soon after she wrote the letter she received anonymous calls telling her to stay out of Marine business Some of my own colleagues warned me You dont want to challenge the Marines on their training methods  she saidThe official investigation into the death of Raheel Siddiqui lasted over a year and spawned two other investigations a more thorough examination of the hazing allegations in the Bourmeche case and a broader hazing inquiry requested in spring 2016 by the Obama White House after the president received an anonymous email from unnamed concerned loved ones of innocent recruits claiming their children were being abusedOn Sept 8 2016 the Marine Corps released the findings of these investigations That same day the corps announced that 20 Marines  including it was later revealed three teams of drill instructors several junior officers Kissoon and the depots new regimental commander Col Paul Cucinotta  had been relieved of duty and faced punishment pending the results of further investigation In early June Kissoon appeared before the militarys version of a grand jury and he is still awaiting charges Six Marines representing much of the chain of command were granted immunity or other considerations to testify against him according to Kissoons lawyer The reports were heavily redacted in the 132page command inquiry into Raheels death the last 43 pages were entirely blacked outOf those involved in the three investigations just six Marines have been formally charged with wrongdoing Four Marines  one of whom was acquitted at trial another who pleaded guilty a third who made a pretrial agreement with prosecutors according to a Marine spokesman and a fourth who faces a general courtmartial  had charges levied against them for abuserelated incidents elsewhere in Lima Company Felix and another drill instructor Staff Sgt Michael Eldridge were charged with a range of offenses including cruelty and maltreatment drunk and disorderly conduct and failure to obey a general order In Felixs case the charges also included obstruction of justice stemming from the dryer incident involving Bourmeche and the hazing of Raheel Both face general courtsmartial later this summerA number of former and current Marine officials including several highranking officers say they are agonized by the reports What Im hearing makes my stomach turn the senior officer I spoke to says This isnt rocket science We have procedures and policies and rules on the books against this stuff and people have to enforce them I mean who is in charge If you are having a hard time controlling those drill instructors youre not a leaderThough it would be tempting to blame the allegations of abuse on a few Marines  the few bad apples theory  Raheels platoonmate told me that rough practices in his platoon continued long after Felix and his drill instructor team were replaced the very next day with another team and after that team was later replaced with another The message he says was the DIs could pretty much get away with anything Lets say you did report something Theyd change the DI and what happens after that Another DI who presumably was friends with the prior DI is going to make your life hellOn Aug 7 nearly a year and a half to the day that Raheel Siddiqui arrived on Parris Island Gunnery Sgt Joseph Felix will stand trial a proceeding expected to last at least two weeks The charges against him are technically violations of military discipline he has not faced broader criminal charges like assault The Siddiqui family thinks the charges are insufficient We were advised that an assault charge was not brought because the other charges carried a harsher penalty says Shiraz Khan the familys lawyer Well the elements of assault are much different and so are the implications The systemic hazing abuse and maltreatment suffered by Raheel Siddiqui while at Parris Island was not the result of a single incident by one individual We arent blind to what Raheels body and autopsy sayWhen I visited the Siddiquis small apartment late last fall Ghazala wearing jeans and a sparkly blue hijab showed me photographs she took of her sons body at the funeral home Why would they do this to my son she said distraught pausing over a photograph of Raheels neck Taking me upstairs she led me into his room which was spotless almost antiseptic a shrine to a sometimes mischievous yet fundamentally obedient boy who prayed at least four times a day dressed in colorful shirts and smiled so much and so often that those who knew him could never imagine him being depressed Ghazala showed off Raheels academic awards and his orange Home Depot apron inscribed with goodluck messages written by every one of his colleagues The dressblue uniform he would have worn upon graduating boot camp hung in his closet neatly pressed The Marines had dressed Raheels body in it He was brainwashed Ghazala said wiping away a tear Hes smart intelligent beautiful excellent boy Perfect I am so proud of my son Ghazala spoke of him in the present tenseNo one from the family has agreed to be interviewed since last winter Their son is gone there are no answers and theyre suffering says Khan who told me that his office has received only 20 or so of about 220 pages theyve requested from the investigation and have had very little direct discussion with the Marines For the most part he says they have learned about any progress in the case by reading the newspapersKate Germano who retired from the Marines in 2016 isnt surprised The last thing the Marines would want is anyone connecting the dots she told me recently This is a cultural issue The conduct that is considered acceptable at Parris Island from the failures in leadership to the handson methods the drill instructors use would not be acceptable anywhere else in the Marine Corps But down there for whatever reason its considered a badge of honor Those who dont see it that way are considered weak But its not the kids faultThe islands new commanding general Austin Renforth known as Sparky who took control several months after Raheels death insists they are rooting out the problem Under his watch officers play a more active role in supervising drill instructors something many officials believe is essential to reforming the culture Renforth though insists the problems on Parris Island arent cultural This place is such a fishbowl  when someone does something wrong it gets national attention but its not systemic he says That said he allowed I have to make sure it never happens again Renforth doesnt explain how he plans to do this other than to say he wants everyone involved in making Marines to have buyin as he puts itRenforth is the epitome of a combat Marine graduate of the US Naval Academy commander during the first gulf war and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan son of a World War II veteran who himself went through boot camp on Parris Island in 1941 This is his first training command and he says he was surprised that many of his DIs were not combat vets A year ago in the very beginning of his tenure Renforth who has five children considered reaching out to Ghazala and Massood He changed his mind I just didnt feel it was my place he saysTragedies happen But a vast majority of recruits he says make it through boot camp just fine We want them all to transform Renforth says If they show up with a little want to in their hearts theyll make it Renforth has no plans to change the fundamentals of training I believe in the way we make Marines and I believe in the product he says In the end its about instilling core values We get kids from all over the nation and we try to fill them up with values he says It changes their livesJanet Reitman is an

dignity using his power for positive change His first major move was the banishment of former Clippers owner Donald Sterling from the NBA because of his extremely racist comments over the course of many years Recently Silver again made a bold statement when he removed the 2017 AllStar Game from North Carolina because of its recently passed antiLGBT lawsI am proud to be a fan of basketball knowing that the NBA stands for equality and firmly against discrimination Also I am extremely interested to see what steps Silver takes in the future in regards to discrimination With many athletes speaking out against police brutality including many in the NBA I hope Silver supports these statements because the NBA can be a catalyst for positive change under the right guidance During this important time in our country Im glad to see at least one sports organization is using their power for goodRunnersUpHonorable MentionsAdvertisement,football,"['keep', 'em', 'coming', 'everyone',

140,Law enforcement officials testified on Wednesday that virtual currencies like Bitcoin had opened up new avenues for crime that government has not been able to keep up withThe most forceful statements came from a prosecutor with the United States attorneys office in Manhattan Richard B Zabel during the second day of hearings about virtual currencies held by New Yorks top financial regulator Benjamin M LawskyMr Zabel went through a list of six ways in which virtual currencies were more prone to crime than current forms of money transfer including the ease with which money could be laundered over borders at the click of a mouseThe testimony of Mr Zabel and Cyrus R Vance Jr the Manhattan district attorney was a blow to Bitcoin advocates who have said that digital money carries no more risk than ordinary money and should not be treated with harsher regulationsBoth Mr Zabel and Mr Vance said they needed more tools than they now possessed to stem the tide of problems cropping up with virtual currencies as they have become more popularWhatever weaknesses they have must be addressed much more seriously Mr Zabel saidMr Lawsky has indicated that Bitcoin is becoming popular enough that regulators need to create regulations that can encourage its growth but limit illegal activity The price of an individual Bitcoin has risen more than 5000 percent over the last year but there has also been a growing list of serious crimes committed in the Bitcoin network which government officials have struggled to clamp down onFor their part Bitcoin advocates have said virtual currencies are no more prone to crime than credit cards or cash One of the most popular arguments put forward is that transactions done by criminals using Bitcoin are easy for law enforcement to trace because of the public ledger where transactions are recorded Earlier this week Mr Zabels office unsealed a complaint against two men accused of helping exchange Bitcoins for people interested in making drug purchasesOn Tuesday during the first day of the hearings Tyler Winklevoss a Bitcoin investor with his twin brother Cameron said that Bitcoin is a terrible place for criminals to conduct criminal activity because of the public ledgerBut Mr Zabel said that while it might be possible to find the computer that a particular Bitcoin purchase came from digital money users had countless ways to cover their tracks that were not available to people going through traditional banksMr Zabel was involved in the team that tracked down Ross Ulbricht whom the authorities contend is the owner of the Silk Road online market where drugs and child pornography were available Mr Ulbricht used a socalled Tor network to obscure himself the authorities said and Mr Zabel said it was only after overcoming substantial hurdles that his office found Mr UlbrichtAnother argument put forward by virtual currency advocates is that cash is actually more attractive to criminals than new forms of digital money because cash can be moved without any digital trace Mr Zabel struck back at that idea by pointing to the difficulty of moving large amounts of cash around the globeAlthough cash is also an anonymous form of currency there are significant barriers to transferring bulk cash out of the banking system he saidThe people representing the Bitcoin industry at the hearings pushed back against any strenuous new regulations on virtual currency companies But at another panel on Wednesday top executives of two of the most prominent Bitcoin companies said they were hoping that Mr Lawsky does provide more regulatory clarity so that everyone will feel more comfortable using digital moneyRegulation could be a good thing said Fred Ehrsam a cofounder of Coinbase the largest middleman for Bitcoin transactionsRegulators around the world have been grappling with the appropriate way to treat Bitcoin coming up with very different approaches The Chinese government recently made many types of virtual currency transactions illegal The hearings in New York drew a global audience Mr Lawsky said viewers from 108 different countries tuned in to the webcast his office set

141,Luca Guadagnino conjures a world of dark beauty in his films and in his apartment in a 17thcentury palazzo outside of MilanWhat he strives for says his friend and frequent collaborator the actress Tilda Swinton is something vital passionate and uncontrollable These aspirations play out in his home as well with each atmospheric room telling a story much as his sets amplify his characters Grand and simple perfect and imperfect harmony emerges from contrast and unlikely pairings like modern Danish chairs in a room with doors lavishly embellished in the Lombardian Baroque style Spare functional furniture in my opinion is the genius of 20thcentury design Guadagnino says He adds only half joking My secret desire is to be an interior designer Id love to make houses for rich clients who can afford to do things rightHis calling card could be his 3200squarefoot apartment on the second floor of a 17thcentury palazzo that sits in the heart of Crema a city 40 minutes from Milan When Guadagnino bought the place a few years ago it had been empty for 40 years  since the countess who lived there died It had broken windows a lot of dead pigeons and rotten wallpaper he saysThe renovation took six months and Guadagnino was onsite every day directing the workers he says After all I am a director What he discovered beneath layers of decaying wallpaper and bright midcentury paint was every palazzo owners dream authentic frescoes Ripping up the 1950s cement tiles revealed the original terracotta bricks now cleaned and buffed When a false ceiling was torn out in the kitchen a 17thcentury painted wood bench now in Guadagninos bedroom was found in a crawl space He worked with the painters to mix pigment for the precise hues in each room it took four tries to get the dining room right from kelly green to the final slate gray For the living rooms boiserie he chose a navy that depending on the hour of the day can seem black The bedroom was easy he says I was eating a date a beautiful brown and I said to the painter Do this color Its like being in the center of a huge dateIn an office that doubles as a guest bedroom he writes his scripts at one of two sidebyside leather desks His partner of seven years also an Italian filmmaker sits at the other Guadagnino who has acquired other apartments in the building has effectively turned much of it into his moviemaking compound His production team works in a groundfloor suite that opens onto the cobblestone courtyardcumparking lot he edits his films in a studio just above them The actors in his films lodged in nearby BBs zoom over on bicycles and watch movies on a screen mounted to a wall in the regal living room Doors always seem open friends and assistants freely wander in and out careful to avoid disturbing the few families still living in the other wing A good creative place the director saysAdvertisementGuadagninos appreciation for incongruity began when he was a child and continued through his education A month after he was born in Palermo in 1971 his family moved to Ethiopia where his Sicilian father taught history and Italian returning home when Luca was 6 While at the University of Palermo where he studied literature he met Patrizia Allegra a fixture of Sicilys cultural scene She would bring the then19yearold cinephile with a particular fondness for Ingmar Bergman along to dinner parties At one Guadagnino recalls Allegra introduced him to the filmmakers JeanMarie Straub and Danile Huillet Patrizia said Oh Monsieur Straub Luca wants to be a director What is your advice Should he go to film school Straub looked at me and said If you want to be a director then you are a film director You dont need to go to school Dont AdvertisementSo he didnt Instead Guadagnino moved to Rome and finished his degree in literature and cinema history at Sapienza University While there he met Laura Betti the muse of Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini I approached her in complete navet and she said Come visit me and we became friends  this big nasty lady and this very skinny young man he says with a laugh I could cook very well so she used me a lot  You have to come now because I have guests Everybody from Bernardo Bertolucci to Valerio Adami the painter  these big personalities together That was my film schoolGuadagnino eventually found his own muse in the film Caravaggio directed by the British experimental filmmaker Derek Jarman I saw Tilda playing Lena he says I thought Ahhh He eagerly sought out her films and by the time Sally Potters Orlando came out in 1992 I was obsessedHe wrote a script for a short film called The Penny Arcade Peepshow inspired by William S Burroughss writings and sent a letter to Swinton via her agent asking if shed star in it He never heard back A few months later he read that she was in Rome for an event He went and was staring at her like a stalker Staring Guadagnino says clearly amused by his youthful gaucherie After one hour she said What can I do for you Somehow he convinced her to be in his film and he pulled together money for her businessclass ticket from London and kicked out his roommates so she could stay in his flat She was incredibly cool The coolest he says After three days she said We are going to be partners in crime and the crime is cinema And we have become thatThey never finished the film  he ran out of money But she agreed to appear in his first feature The Protagonists which he now dismisses as a learning experience Later she starred in I Am Love and A Bigger Splash The former film established Guadagninos mature style both as a filmmaker and a creator of environments of melancholic glamour Polished and refined are the last words I would use to describe his work and I mean that as a high compliment Swinton says There is nothing smoothed away hidden or suppressed Rather a proper rawness of sensibility and pulse something pagan profoundly wildI Am Love is shot in the architect Piero Portaluppis masterpiece the Villa Necchi Campiglio in Milan and it is as much a star of the film as Swinton Portaluppi the Italian Modernist architect of choice to society in the 1920s and 30s was an obsessive perfectionist much like Guadagnino We have no bedside tables because I cant find any that I like yet he says My partner wants to kill meThe passionate cook had better luck in the kitchen with a fishmongers stone sink from Genoa and a large cheesemakers table from a nearby village The shelves are packed with international cookbooks I like to host  a lot he saysAdvertisementDinner parties are staged in the enclosed loggia that runs the length of the apartment the mix of guests cast as carefully as his films You know when they say you need to put people who go well together Guadagnino asks I much prefer to put people who fight at the table Then you have some sort of sparkle at the dinnerFor one meal friend and fellow director James Ivory filmed Guadagnino rolling and cutting fresh fettuccine on his pastamaker Luca is no less commanding in the kitchen than on his set  tall semibald his hair flying up every which way Ivory says Though Guadagnino usually cooks himself on occasion he invites his friend Niko Romito Abruzzos threeMichelinstar chef to take charge Then the director says everyone eats very wellA look from across The New

horticulture Guadagnino tells me about a trip to Sweden last summer to visit Dutch garden designer Piet Oudolfs Dream Park I told my friends We have to be there at 8 oclock in the morning when the light is nicest We land there and everyone is grumpy and then we turn and we are in front of this wonder and everyone exhales We spent two hours wandering around I must admit I had this slight attack

142,Moviesshovies cultureshmulture and Desi youth pastimesIts meant to be a powerful scene mortals named after a deity making the fated pilgrimage but instead of being moved you are surprised at their fervor Or was it just me Murabba was based on a silly idea Why dedicate a film meant to capture a special occasion to celebrate someone who spends his every waking moment being celebrated If it isnt unfair enough that celebrations of Indian cinema have turned out to be all about Bollywood they end up naturally as being all about Mr BachchanTrue Mr Bachchan means a number of things to Indians He symbolizes the anger and frustrations of an entire generation He embodies the largerthanlife quality of Bollywood He epitomizes the heroism of the Hindi film hero He has handled his fame gracefully For all of this we have celebrated him since he rose to stardom in the 1970sThe problem is that the man stopped being awesome a really long time ago but it hasnt affected the Idea of Bachchan Like all true devotees we Indians dont want to question the worthiness of the one chosen to be our god It has almost become a part of Indian culture to revere Mr Bachchan Indeed the fact that we refuse to identify a cultural icon worthy enough to succeed Mr Bachchan says as much about us as it does about himIn a contest hosted by Big CBS last year he was voted the nations prime icon beating the composer AR Rahman the actor Aamir Khan the cricketer Sachin Tendulkar and Narendra Modi Gujarats chief minister  in that orderAssuming that young people the Englishlanguage channels target group made up a sizable number of the voters one wonders what precise appeal Mr Bachchan holds for a generation that came of age after the best years of his career were long over What makes him score over beloved youth icons like Mr Khan or Mr Tendulkar since unlike that of the other contenders a quick look at Mr Bachchans recent career and life as public figure reveals very little that is remarkableIn the past decade or so he has also made a new career out of brand endorsement Among the products that he has tried to sell Indians are milk jewelry chocolate banking services cellphones cold cream cars insurance pens paint real estate cement dress material diet supplements instant noodles and Gujarat tourismIt is hard to trust his judgment because of the sheer number and variety of things he is happy to recommend to us wearing what seems like the same suit and the same expression of ultimate satisfaction Its certainly not his personality as brand ambassador that makes him Indias prime iconFrom lame aphorisms T 1108  The world is made up of all kinds  some made up some kind to shallow philosophy There will be inequality and distinct distinction The lesser shall always be in the awe inspiring more The bourgeoisie will ever find complexity in the elite and the class That shall ever remain a constant for some will have and most have not his online personality is an extension of his public self which is marked by labored politeness and platitudesThere is one job however at which Mr Bachchan shines and thats hosting a television game show Since he joined Kaun Banega Crorepati the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire in 2000 he has come to define and prove indispensable to the quiz show that offers ordinary Indians a chance to win 50 million rupees 911000 A perfect combination of gentleness and wit Mr Bachchan displays every quality on air that television hosts aspire to his understanding of the contestants hopes and fears appearing to be only sharper with every yearNo matter how much we want it to be true Mr Bachchan isnt a timeless icon He might be a television icon and that is what he should be celebrated forIndias national elections began April 7 and will continue on nine separate dates until May 12 with results expected to be announced on May 16The vote is the worlds largest with 814 million eligible voters set to choose 543 members of the lower house of Parliament The other two seats will be appointed by the president This election is widely considered to be Indias most consequential since 1977FollowAdvertisement,banking,"['moviesshovies',

in Tallahassee and as US Attorney General  lived here for the rest of her life The bed and other antiques once belonged to her maternal grandparents I dont know how old they are says her sister Maggy Hurchalla but Ive known them for as long as I remember and I just turned 76Across the length of 2016 the photographer Mitch Epstein  known for making careful largeformat images that draw rich meaning out of places and objects  arranged to visit the living and working spaces of some of the monumental figures we lost this year The goal was to arrive not long after each persons death in those days when a persons spirit can still seem palpable somewhere among their rooms and their things  as in his photograph of the writer Jim Harrisons studio where the items on a bedside table seem as if they were set down only moments agoMarisols sculpture with its Pop Art vibrancy and folkart intimacy made her a onename celebrity in the 1960s art world and she purchased her TriBeCa loft and studio in 1979 before the neighborhoods rapid redevelopment With shades drawn the stillness of this sitting area now stands in contrast to the bustle and gleam outside In the center is a flat file for smaller drawings at left a preliminary drawing for the 1989 sculpture John Washington and Emily Roebling Crossing the Brooklyn Bridge for the First TimeHe also had an upright bicycle out there says Shandlings friend Bruce Grayson of this nook in the comedians Brentwood home But Shandlings great love was boxing He coowned a gym in Santa Monica and sparred when in good health multiple times a week In interviews hed compare the sport to his career in comedy Its getting over that fear Grayson says He used to make that metaphor all the time  boxing taught him how to bob and weave onstage to be agile and not get back on his heelsAfter a stroke in 2009 the selftaught artist began working in the back of Dial Metal Patterns of Bessemer Ala a fabrication company owned by two of his sons Dial who grew up in the Depressionera South spent much of his adult life laboring in factories and used industrial materials and other castoffs in many of his artworks When his sons first opened the studio after Dials death unfinished work still hung under fluorescent lights on one of the pressedwood wallsJim liked naps says Joyce Harrington Bahle who assisted the celebrated writer for 37 years  hence the bed in the small writing studio he kept behind his Montana home On one wall hangs A Correlated History of Earth charting the planets development over 45 billion years on another a painting by Harrisons friend Jill Eggers of a thicket Bahle says Harrison always saw thickets as places of refuge Outside looking out toward the Absaroka mountains is the solitary bench where he liked to begin each workdayIt was some months after the musicians death that this photo was taken in the Galaxy Room of his Paisley Park Studios  a lounge space attached to the studios production facilities The astronomical images are painted on the walls and lit by blacklights in the ceiling fixtures throughout the studio space are copious candles incense burners and other moodsetting flourishesWiesels home

scroll housed in its own bookshelf cabinetI always felt when I was visiting that I was getting to hang out with Edward and be in this great museum at the same time says Sam Rudy Albees longtime friend and publicist The playwright was a passionate collector of art and filled his Manhattan loft with countless pieces  like Walt Kuhns Helen 1929 the striking portrait seen here This nook was where Albee read and took phone calls Rudy also recalls arriving for appointments and finding the notoriously punctual writer on his worn leather chair jacket draped over one knee in full waiting mode There was always tremendous still and quiet and calm in the loft he says except when there was a party It was not unlike a museum in that regardThe historian and anthropologist  one of the last living people to

150,The next phase in the development of virtual currencies like Bitcoin was highlighted at a hearing last week conducted by Benjamin M Lawsky New York States top banking regulator The question is not whether there will be greater regulation of firms developing new methods of transmitting payments with nongovernment currencies but how much regulation they will faceThe only ones not subject to the Bank Secrecy Act are users of virtual currencies who only buy and sell goods and services FinCen exempted their transactions which means individuals and merchants who use Bitcoin like cash do not need to comply with the regulations imposed on those operating exchangesIf that were the extent of government regulation there would be little concern about the negative effect of new rules on the development of virtual currencies No one supports creating an anonymous bazaar for dealing in drugs and other illegal goods and services  except perhaps the criminals themselvesThe more difficult issue is whether the government will reach further and try to impose more onerous rules on the exchanges and users of virtual currenciesIt might be helpful to consider what underpins any form of currency Putting it simply there are two aspects to currency the medium by which it is exchanged and the promise it incorporatesWhile regulators debate the pros and cons of bitcoins this volatile digital currency inspires the question What makes money moneyThe medium can be almost anything from paper notes and coins to gold and silver to electronic credits stored in a financial institution or central bank account When a government issues currency it comes with the promise that it is a legitimate means of transacting business in that country A dollar bill for instance states that it is legal tender for all debts public and privateBut virtual currencies raise concerns about how they can be transmitted and used for illegal purposes Testimony before Mr Lawsky by Richard B Zabel the deputy United States attorney in Manhattan highlighted the challenge facing law enforcement with the ease of movement that a medium like Bitcoin can provideTransferring 1 million in cash to buy drugs in another country would be difficult because of the sheer bulk of that much money and would probably get the attention of banking officials Using the equivalent in Bitcoin however only involves a few keystrokes So a virtual currency would be much more attractive than cash to those engaging in global illegal transactionsThe regulations in place for virtual currency exchanges may not be enough to satisfy law enforcements desire to keep criminals from creating a new avenue for transferring value across borders If someone was able to gather up enough Bitcoin while avoiding scrutiny from virtual currency exchanges then the transactions could fly beneath the regulatory reporting rulesRegulators are also concerned that exchanges based in foreign countries might not impose the same customer disclosure requirements as the United States If someone can use a foreign exchange to conduct business outside the American governments watchful gaze then criminals could find ways to slip between the cracks and avoid scrutinyIt would not be a surprise if one tool would require those who control or trade over a certain threshold amount of a virtual currency to report their holdings to the government This approach is much like the rules requiring the owner of 5 percent of the shares of a publicly traded company to disclose any transactions to the Securities and Exchange CommissionOne promise supporting government currencies is that they have a certain value A central bank work tirelessly to maintain a target level for its currency in relation to other currencies which explains why the fear of inflation is so greatVirtual currencies do not carry the same promise So they depend on the market to determine their value which is often stated in relation to a traditional currency like the dollar or euro The government has no stake in how Bitcoin is valued but it is concerned that consumers be protected from abuses when they use a virtual currency to pay for goods and servicesTo protect consumers who want to use Bitcoin for legitimate transactions the government may adopt reporting requirements on virtual currency exchanges so that there is a public repository of information about prices Although the government cannot control the value of a virtual currency it can make the currency more transparent to users so that they are not defraudedMuch as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate stock and futures exchanges government regulators may require centralizing the trading in virtual currencies so that the market is less susceptible to manipulation That is a short step from treating firms that trade in virtual currencies like stock and commodities brokers which are subject to extensive disclosure and capital requirementsThe days of anonymous transactions in Bitcoin and operating an exchange with no outside interference are over As virtual currencies develop firms devoted to aiding trading and perhaps even their users will encounter greater government regulation along with the costs that come with complianceAdvertisement,banking,"['the', 'next', 'phase', 'in', 'the', 'development', 'of', 'virtual', 'currencies', 'like',

152,Travis Kalanicks drive to win in life has led to a pattern of risktaking that has at times put his ridehailing company on the brink of implosionSAN FRANCISCO  Travis Kalanick the chief executive of Uber visited Apples headquarters in early 2015 to meet with Timothy D Cook who runs the iPhone maker It was a session that Mr Kalanick was dreadingFor months Mr Kalanick had pulled a fast one on Apple by directing his employees to help camouflage the ridehailing app from Apples engineers The reason So Apple would not find out that Uber had been secretly identifying and tagging iPhones even after its app had been deleted and the devices erased  a fraud detection maneuver that violated Apples privacy guidelinesBut Apple was onto the deception and when Mr Kalanick arrived at the midafternoon meeting sporting his favorite pair of bright red sneakers and hotpink socks Mr Cook was prepared So Ive heard youve been breaking some of our rules Mr Cook said in his calm Southern tone Stop the trickery Mr Cook then demanded or Ubers app would be kicked out of Apples App StoreFor Mr Kalanick the moment was fraught with tension If Ubers app was yanked from the App Store it would lose access to millions of iPhone customers  essentially destroying the ridehailing companys business So Mr Kalanick accededAdvertisementIn a quest to build Uber into the worlds dominant ridehailing entity Mr Kalanick has openly disregarded many rules and norms backing down only when caught or cornered He has flouted transportation and safety regulations bucked against entrenched competitors and capitalized on legal loopholes and gray areas to gain a business advantage In the process Mr Kalanick has helped create a new transportation industry with Uber spreading to more than 70 countries and gaining a valuation of nearly 70 billion and its business continues to growBut the previously unreported encounter with Mr Cook showed how Mr Kalanick was also responsible for risktaking that pushed Uber beyond the pale sometimes to the very brink of implosionCrossing that line was not a oneoff for Mr Kalanick According to interviews with more than 50 current and former Uber employees investors and others with whom the executive had personal relationships Mr Kalanick 40 is driven to the point that he must win at whatever he puts his mind to and at whatever cost  a trait that has now plunged Uber into its most sustained set of crises since its founding in 2009AdvertisementTraviss biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals said Mark Cuban the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr Kalanick Traviss biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals Thats the best way to describe himThat quality also extended to his personal life where Mr Kalanick mixes with celebrities like Jay Z and businessmen including President Trumps chief economic adviser Gary D Cohn But it has alienated some Uber executives employees and advisers Mr Kalanick with saltandpepper hair a fastpaced walk and an iPhone practically embedded in his hand is described by friends as more at ease with data and numbers some consider him a math savant than with peopleThrough an Uber spokesman Mr Kalanick declined an interview request Apple declined to comment on the meeting with Mr Cook Many of the people interviewed for this article who revealed previously unreported details of Mr Kalanicks life asked to remain anonymous because they had signed nondisclosure agreements with Uber or feared damaging their relationship with the chief executiveAdvertisementMr Kalanicks pattern for pushing limits is deeply ingrained It began during his childhood in suburban Los Angeles where he went from being bullied to being the aggressor continued through his years taking risks at two technology startups there and crystallized in his role at UberMr Kalanick grew up in the Northridge neighborhood of Los Angeles His parents Bonnie and Donald Kalanick made sure he and his brother Cory were never left wanting He was naturally athletic and competitive and excelled at running track and playing footballAt Patrick Henry Middle School he was a wiry student who got good grades  putting him in the sights of some older kids who picked on him Mr Kalanick later vowed never to be bullied again and turned the tables on his tormentorsHe also showed signs of entrepreneurialism One summer he sold knives doortodoor for the cutlery company Cutco At 18 he started New Way Academy his own SAT prep business with a partnerThe startup life soon called to him After attending the University of California Los Angeles to major in computer engineering Mr Kalanick dropped out in 1998 to form a startup with several classmates The company Scour became a peertopeer file exchange similar to Napster which let people digitally share music and media files through legally dubious meansScour which was eventually sued for 250 billion for alleged copyright infringement filed for bankruptcy in October 2000 a move that protected it from the suit The failure did not stop Mr Kalanick from helping to found another Los Angeles startup Red Swoosh four months later Red Swoosh made a technology to efficiently transfer large files of digital data one of its investors was Mr CubanSean Stanton Red Swooshs former vice president for sales said of Mr Kalanick Scour was about efficiency Swoosh was about efficiency Its just the way his brain is wired Its like the way Uber works right now Whats the fastest cheapest and most efficient way to get from point A to point B That consumes him and all parts of his lifeWith Red Swoosh Mr Kalanick started exhibiting his hallmark aggressiveness When the company struggled Mr Kalanick and a partner took the tax dollars from employee paychecks  which are supposed to be withheld and sent to the Internal Revenue Service  and reinvested the money into the startup even as friends and advisers warned him the action was potentially illegalAdvertisementWith Mr Kalanick desperate to keep Red Swoosh afloat he moved back into his parents house He staved off bankruptcy for a second time by raising another round of funding The wayward tax dollars eventually went to the IRSMr Kalanick also decamped to Thailand with his software team in April 2006 to save money by living cheaply abroad while also using the trip as a teambuilding exerciseIn 2007 Mr Kalanick sold Red Swoosh to Akamai a cloud services company for roughly 19 million The deal turned the executive who had headed north to San Francisco into a millionaireBy then some advisers had soured on him The Travis Kalanick I came to know 17 years ago was relentless in pursuit of his goals at the expense of those who supported him along the way deluded by his own embellished personal narrative and a serial prevaricator said Peter Yorke a former Red Swoosh adviser and a longtime tech executiveOthers stuck by him Michael Robertson chief executive of MP3com an early digital music sharing service said that he told Mr Kalanick Sometimes in business you have to battle the establishment and it can get brutal and uglyIn San Francisco Mr Kalanick and Angie You his longtime girlfriend bought a townhouse nestled in the upper hills of the citys Castro section Though the couple have since split the two remain close and still speak on a regular basisThe idea for Uber came in 2009 from Garrett Camp a friend of Mr Kalanicks who became fixated on hailing a private luxury car with a smartphone app after being unable to catch cabs in San FranciscoAdvertisementA few months later Mr Kalanick changed his mind and took over as UberCabs chief He quickly positioned the startup as an alternative to the taxi industry At the time taxi companies had iron grips in many towns Citybycity regulations required procedures like base stations for cabs safety measures and other stipulationsMr Kalanick ignored those rulesWere in a political campaign he once said at a technology conference and the candidate is Uber The opponent is named Taxi he said adding a rude descriptive Nobody likes him hes not a nice character but hes so woven into the political machinery and fabric that a lot of people owe him favorsMr Kalanick carried that same level of intensity into Ubers headquarters pacing briskly while working by doing laps around the office His pacing is so legendary his father once said that he wore a hole in the carpetingMr Kalanick focused on expanding UberCab quickly The company typically sent a small strike team into a new city  say Seattle  to aggressively recruit new drivers through Craigslist and other online listings Then the team marketed UberCabs app to increase ridershipThat drew attention from regulators In October 2010 the company shortened its name to Uber after receiving a ceaseanddesist letter from San Francisco officials for marketing itself as a taxi company without the proper licenses and permitsTo influence local legislators to accept Uber Mr Kalanick took extra steps In 2014 Uber hired Ben Metcalfe an engineer who described his job on LinkedIn as building custom tools to support citizen engagement across legislative matters to drive social good and social changeAdvertisementIn practice Mr Metcalfe and his team created an emailbased system to aid Uber users and drivers to directly contact local legislators to lobby for allowing Uber in their cities The system was similar to Changeorg a website that pushes social change through online petitions City and state officials were soon deluged with emails supporting UberIn some places Uber employees were also told to create computer programs known as scripts that would automatically vote for the ridehailing service in cityadministered surveysThe Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industryPlease verify youre not a robot by clicking the boxInvalid

moved into the spotlightIt did not come naturally One friend recalled a night out with a group of married couples at the Gold Club a San Francisco strip club a few years ago Mr Kalanick who was single pulled out a laptop to work on a spreadsheet crunching Ubers numbers while friends watched the dancers onstageAnother friend called Mr Kalanick a tech world rock star which means something different in Silicon Valley than in the music worldTo work with and around one requires a different kind of mentality and skill said Andy Abramson an early adviser to Mr Kalanick Mr Abramson likened the chief executive to other idiosyncratic founders like Jeff Bezos of AmazonMr Kalanick was eventually coaxed more into the limelight by others Shervin Pishevar an Uber investor sometimes took Mr Kalanick to clubs in Los Angeles on the weekend providing a car and a change of club clothes Mr Pishevar who did not respond to a request for comment was the Uber chiefs entryway into Los Angeless world of celebrityAdvertisementHollywood stars were eager to buy into Uber which they had started using to get around Actors like Edward Norton Olivia Munn and Sophia Bush took small stakes in the company Mr Kalanick and a top lieutenant Emil Michael sometimes hung out with Leonardo DiCaprio who is also an investor and Jay Z whose wife Beyonc performed for Uber employees at a poolside party in Las Vegas in 2015Jay Z once wired money to Mr Michael in an attempt to invest even more in Uber Mr Michael and Mr Kalanick giddy at rebuffing a celebrity wired some of the money back saying they already had too many interested investors Representatives for Jay Z did not respond to requests for commentMr Kalanick also dreamed of luring celebrities into advisory roles at Uber One aim was persuading Oprah Winfrey to join the board  something Uber executives believed could happen after Mr Kalanick met Ms Winfrey at a party on the Spanish island of Ibiza  but the idea never jelled A spokeswoman for Ms Winfrey declined to commentMr Kalanick began mixing with elite business executives He developed a close relationship with Mr Cohn then a topranking executive at Goldman Sachs At one point the two men spoke on a near daily basis Mr Cohn and a White House spokeswoman did not return requests for commentMr Kalanicks main mantra was growth above all elseThat meant Ubers top performers were often promoted and protected When one general manager a title for a citylevel chief threw a coffee mug at a subordinate in a fit of rage the incident was reported to human resources  but there was no followup At the time Ubers business in the general managers city was strongOther complaints also fell on deaf earsAfter a backlash over Ubers use of surge pricing raising ride prices when demand is high amid an East Coast snowstorm in 2013 Mr Kalanicks response to upset riders was a torrent of economics and mathAdvertisementFriends and employees told Mr Kalanick that he should at least pretend to care about how it looked to take such a hostile stance with Ubers users Several described him as emotionally unintelligentWith Mr Kalanick setting the tone at Uber employees acted to ensure the ridehailing service would win no matter whatThey spent much of their energy oneupping rivals like Lyft Uber devoted teams to socalled competitive intelligence purchasing data from an analytics service called Slice Intelligence Using an email digest service it owns named Unrollme Slice collected its customers emailed Lyft receipts from their inboxes and sold the anonymized data to Uber Uber used the data as a proxy for the health of Lyfts business Lyft too operates a competitive intelligence teamAdvertisementUber also tried to win over Lyfts drivers Ubers driver satisfaction rating an internal metric has dropped since February 2016 and roughly a quarter of its drivers turn over on average every three months According to an internal slide deck on driver income levels viewed by The New York Times Uber considered Lyft and McDonalds its main competition for attracting new driversTo frustrate Lyft drivers Uber dispatched some employees to order and cancel Lyft rides en masse Others hailed Lyfts and spent the rides persuading drivers to switch to Uber full timeThat year Uber came close to buying Lyft At a meeting at Mr Kalanicks house and over cartons of Chinese food he and Mr Michael hosted Lyfts president John Zimmer who asked for 15 percent of Uber in exchange for selling Lyft Over the next hour Mr Kalanick and Mr Michael repeatedly laughed at Mr Zimmers audacious request No deal was reached Lyft declined to commentThe rivalry remains in force In 2016 Uber held a summit meeting in Mexico City for some top managers where it distributed a playbook on how to cut into Lyfts business and had sessions on how to damage its competitorTo develop its own business Uber sidestepped the authorities Some employees started using a tool called Greyball to deceive officials trying to shut down Ubers service The tool developed to aid driver safety and to trick fraudsters essentially showed a fake version of Ubers app to some people to disguise the locations of cars and drivers It soon became a way for Uber drivers to evade capture by law enforcement in places where the service was deemed illegalAdvertisementThe idea of fooling Apple the main distributor of Ubers app began in 2014At the time Uber was dealing with widespread account fraud in places like China where tricksters bought stolen iPhones that were erased and resold Some Uber drivers there would then create dozens of fake email addresses to sign up for new Uber rider accounts attached to each phone and request rides from those phones which they would then accept Since Uber was handing out incentives to drivers to take more rides the drivers could earn more money this wayThe startup has undertaken an extraordinary experiment in behavioral science to subtly entice an independent work force to maximize company revenueTo halt the activity Uber engineers assigned a persistent identity to iPhones with a small piece of code a practice called fingerprinting Uber could then identify an iPhone and prevent itself from being fooled even after the device was erased of its contentsThere was one problem Fingerprinting iPhones broke Apples rules Mr Cook believed that wiping an iPhone should ensure that no trace of the owners identity remained on the deviceSo Mr Kalanick told his engineers to geofence Apples headquarters in Cupertino Calif a way to digitally identify people reviewing Ubers software in a specific location Uber would then obfuscate its code for people within that geofenced area essentially drawing a digital lasso around those it wanted to keep in the dark Apple employees at its headquarters were unable to see Ubers fingerprintingThe ruse did not last Apple engineers outside of Cupertino caught on to Ubers methods prompting Mr Cook to call Mr Kalanick to his officeMr Kalanick was shaken by Mr Cooks scolding according to a person who saw him after the meetingBut only momentarily After all Mr Kalanick had faced off against Apple and Uber had survived He had lived to fight another

153,Updated 854 pm Mr Boies and his team had their own prop too The television displays in the courtroom shone with a blackandwhite image of the cover complete with a sticker that read AutographedBut while the scene of Mr Geithner sitting in the witness box frequently holding a copy of his own book paging through with the help of some stylish reading glasses struck some in the courtroom as a bit farcical the strategy by Mr Greenbergs legal team was carefully orchestratedMr Greenbergs side believes that much of what Mr Geithner has said in his book  and which he consequently cannot dispute during the trial without hurting his own credibility  helps the shareholders case according to people briefed on the legal strategy Mr Greenbergs lawyers also obtained transcripts of the unpublished interviews the former Treasury secretary gave to people assisting him with putting together Stress TestWhile Mr Geithner mostly concurred with his previous statements he also struggled at times to explain his own words  seemingly boxed in by judgments he uttered as part of his bookCertainly Citi and B of A were insolvent Mr Geithner had said during the book interviewThe two men then engaged in a lengthy backandforth over the definition of insolventDuring more than six hours of testimony Mr Geithners was not the only book introduced The other volume was the secretive compilation of the Federal Reserves legal powers known internally at the central bank as the Doomsday Book which has never been made publicWhen Mr Boies moved to introduce two of the editions of the book into evidence the New York Feds own lawyer John Kiernan sprang up from the gallery to chime in The Fed wanted the Doomsday Book kept strictly under sealJudge Wheeler determined he would let the editions into evidence under a temporary seal until a hearing to determine whether they should stay that way Mr Boies did not appear to mind if most of the contents remained secret as long as he could ask Mr Geithner certain questions that related to the Feds textsWe were operating outside of the boundaries of established precedent Mr Geithner saidAs the trial continues the civil case which will be decided by the judge may rest on whether he believes that the Fed acted within its authority under the Federal Reserve Act in imposing certain terms on AIGs loan or if it stepped over the legal lineIt was a failure of the country to put in place a system to constrain risktaking Mr Geithner said Risk migrated to places where constraints did not existBy ANDREW ROSS SORKINMaurice R Greenberg AIGs

154,Urban fiction or street lit has been snubbed by the publishing industry and scorned by black intellectuals Yet these authors may just be the most successful literary couple in AmericaOne day that summer JaQuavis met a fellow dealer in a parking lot on Flints west side He was there to make a bulk sale of a quarterbrick or ninepiece  a nineounce parcel of cocaine with a street value of about 11000 In the middle of the transaction JaQuavis heard the telltale chirp of a walkietalkie His customer he now realized was an undercover policeman JaQuavis jumped into his car and spun out onto the road with two unmarked police cars in pursuit He didnt want to get into a highspeed chase so he whipped his car into a church parking lot and made a run for it darting into an alleyway behind a row of small houses where he tossed the quarterbrick into some bushes When JaQuavis reached the small residential street on the other side of the houses he was greeted by the police who handcuffed him and went to search behind the houses where they told him they were certain he had ditched the drugs JaQuavis had been dealing since he was 12 had amassed more than 100000 and had never been arrested Now he thought Its overBut when the police looked in the bushes they couldnt find any cocaine They interrogated JaQuavis who denied having ever possessed or sold drugs They combed the backyard alley some more After an hour of fruitless efforts the police were forced to unlock the handcuffs and release their suspectJaQuavis was baffled by the turn of events until the next day when he received a phone call The previous afternoon a 15yearold girl had been sitting in her home on the west side of Flint when she heard sirens She looked out of the window of her bedroom and watched a young man throw a package in the bushes behind her house She recognized him He was a high school classmate  a handsome charismatic boy whom she had admired from afar The girl crept outside and grabbed the bundle which she hid in her basement I have something that belongs to you Ashley Snell told JaQuavis Coleman when she reached him by phone You wanna come over here and pick it upThat partnership turned out to be creative and entrepreneurial as well as romantic Over the past decade the Colemans have published nearly 50 books sometimes as solo writers sometimes under pseudonyms but usually as collaborators with a byline that has become a trusted brand Ashley  JaQuavis They are marquee stars of urban fiction or street lit a genre whose innercity settings and lurid mix of crime sex and sensationalism have earned it comparisons to gangsta rap The emergence of street lit is one of the big stories in recent American publishing a juggernaut that has generated huge sales by catering to a readership  young black and for the most part female  that historically has been illserved by the book business But the genre is also widely maligned Street lit is subject to a kind of triple snobbery scorned by literati who look down on genre fiction generally ignored by a white publishing establishment that remains largely indifferent to black books and disparaged by AfricanAmerican intellectuals for poor writing coarse values and trafficking in racial stereotypesBut if a certain kind of cultural prestige is shut off to the Colemans they have reaped other rewards Theyve built a large and loyal fan base which gobbles up the new Ashley  JaQuavis titles that arrive every few months Many of those books are sold at streetcorner stands and other offthegrid venues in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods a literary gray market that doesnt register a blip on bestseller tallies Yet the Colemans most popular series now regularly crack the trade fiction bestseller lists of The New York Times and Publishers Weekly For years the pair had no literary agent they sold hundreds of thousands of books without banking a penny in royalties Still they have earned millions of dollars almost exclusively from cashformanuscript deals negotiated directly with independent publishing houses In short though little known outside of the world of urban fiction the Colemans are one of Americas most successful literary couples a distinction theyve achieved they insist because of their works gritty authenticity and their devotion to a primal literary virtue the power of the ripping yarnWhen you read our books youre gonna realize Ashley  JaQuavis are storytellers  says Ashley Our tales will get your heart poundingTHE COLEMANS HOME BASE  the cottage from which they operate their cottage industry  is a spacious fourbedroom house in a genteel suburb about 35 miles north of downtown Detroit The house is plush but when I visited this past winter it was sparsely appointed The couple had just recently moved in and had only had time to fully furnish the bedroom of their 4yearold son QuayeIn conversation Ashley and JaQuavis exude both modesty and bravado gratitude for their good fortune and bootstrappers pride in having made their own luck They talk a lot about their time in the trenches the years they spent as a drug dealer and rideordie girl tandem In Flint they learned to grind hard Writing they say is merely a more elevated kind of grindInstead of hitting the block like we used to we hit the laptops says Ashley I know what every word is worth So while Im writing Im like Okay theres a hundred dollars Theres a thousand dollars Theres five thousand dollars They maintain a rigorous regimen They each try to write 5000 words per day five days a week The writers stagger their shifts JaQuavis goes to bed at 7 pm and wakes up early around 3 or 4 in the morning to work while his wife and child sleep Ashley writes during the day often in libraries or at StarbucksThey divide the labor in other ways Chapters are divvied up more or less equally with tasks assigned according to individual strengths JaQuavis typically handles character development Ashley loves writing murder scenes The results are stitched together with no editorial interference from one author in the others text The real work they contend is the brainstorming The Colemans spend weeks mapping out their plotdriven books  long conversations that turn into elaborate diagrams on dryerase boards JaQuavis and I are so close it makes the process real easy says Ashley Sometimes when Im thinking of something a plot point hell say it out loud and Im like Wait  did I say that Their collaboration developed by accident and on the fly Both were bookish teenagers Ashley read lots of Judy Blume and John Grisham JaQuavis liked Shakespeare Richard Wright and Atlas Shrugged Their first official date was at a Borders bookstore where Ashley bought The Coldest Winter Ever the Sister Souljah novel often credited with kickstarting the contemporary streetlit movement In 2003 Ashley then 17 was forced to terminate an ectopic pregnancy She was bedridden for three weeks and to provide distraction and boost her spirits JaQuavis challenged his girlfriend to a writing contest She just wasnt talking She was laying in bed I said You know what I bet you I could write a better book than you My wife is real competitive So I said Yo all right 500 bet And I saw her eyes spark like What You cant write no better book than me So I wrote about three chapters She wrote about three chapters Two days later we switchedThe result hammered out in a few days would become Dirty Money Two years later when Ashley and JaQuavis were students at Ferris State University in Western Michigan they sold the manuscript to Urban Books a streetlit imprint founded by the bestselling author Carl Weber At the time JaQuavis was still making his living selling drugs When Ashley got the phone call informing her that their book had been bought she assumed theyd hit it big and flushed more than 10000 worth of cocaine down the toilet Their advance was a mere 4000Those advances would soon increase eventually reaching five and six figures The Colemans built their career JaQuavis says in a manner that made sense to him as a veteran dope peddler by flooding the street with product From the start they were prolific churning out books at a rate of four or five a year Their novels made their way into stores the nowdefunct chain Waldenbooks which had stores in urban areas typically bypassed by booksellers was a major engine of the streetlit market But Ashley and JaQuavis took advantage of distribution channels established by pioneering urban fiction authors such as Teri Woods and Vickie Stringer and a network of streetcorner tables magazine stands corner shops and bodegas Like rappers who establish their bona fides with graymarket mixtapes streetlit authors use this system to circumnavigate industry gatekeepers bringing their work straight to the genres core readership But urban fiction has other aficionados in less likely places Our books are so popular in the prison system JaQuavis says Were banned in certain penitentiaries Inmates fight over the books  there are incidents you know I have loved ones in jail and theyre like Yo your books cant come in here Its against the rules Copulating paperbacks aside its clear that the streetlit debate is about more than literature touching on questions of paternalism versus populism and on middleclass anxieties about the black underclass Its part and parcel of black elites efforts to define not only a literary tradition but a racial politics said Kinohi Nishikawa an assistant professor of English and AfricanAmerican Studies at Princeton University There has always been a sense that because AfricanAmericans opportunities to represent themselves are so limited in the first place any hint of criminality or salaciousness would necessarily be a knock on the entire racial politics One of the pressing debates about AfricanAmerican literature today is If we cant include writers like Ashley  JaQuavis to what extent is the foundation of our thinking about black literature faulty Is it just a literature for elites Or can it be inclusive bringing urban fiction under the purview of our umbrella term AfricanAmerican literatureFor their part the Colemans place their work in the broader black literary tradition You have Maya Angelou Alice Walker James Baldwin  all of these traditional black writers who wrote about the struggles of racism injustice inequality says Ashley Were writing about the struggle as it happens now Its just a different struggle Im telling my story Im telling the struggle of a black girl from Flint Michigan who grew up on welfarePerhaps there is a highminded case to be made for street lit But the virtues of Ashley  JaQuaviss work are more basic Their novels do lack literary polish The writing is not graceful there are passages of clunky exposition and sex scenes that induce guffaws and eye rolls But the pleasure quotient is high The books flaunt a garish brand of feminism with women characters cast not just as vixens but also as gangsters  coldblooded killers murder mamas The stories are exceptionally wellplotted The Cartel opens by introducing its hero the crime boss Carter Diamond on page 9 a gunshot spatters Diamonds brain across the interior of a police cruiser The book then flashes back seven years and begins to hurtle forward again  a bullet train whizzing readers through shifting alliances romantic entanglements and betrayals kidnappings shootouts with Haitian and Dominican gangsters and a cliffhanger closing scene that leaves the novels heroine tied to a chair in a basement gruesomely tortured to the edge of death Ashley  JaQuaviss books are not Ralph Ellison certainly but they build up quite a head of steam They moveThe Colemans are moving themselves these days They recently signed a deal with St Martins Press which will bring out the next installment in the Cartel series as well as new solo series by both writers The St Martins deal is both lucrative and legitimizing  a validation of Ashley and JaQuaviss work by one of publishings most venerable houses The Colemans ambitions have grown as well A recent trilogy Murderville tackles human trafficking and the blooddiamond industry in West Africa with storylines that sweep from Sierra Leone to Mexico to Los Angeles Increasingly Ashley  JaQuavis are leaning on research  traveling to farflung settings and hitting the books in the libraries  and spending less time mining their own roughandtumble pastBut Flint remains a source of inspiration One evening not long ago JaQuavis led me on a tour of his hometown a popular roadside bar the parking lot where he met the undercover cop for the illfated drug deal Ashleys old house the site of his almostarrest He took me to a ramshackle vehicle repair shop on Flints west side where he worked as a kid washing cars He showed me a bathroom at the rear of the garage where at age 12 he sneaked away to inspect the first boulder of crack that he ever sold A spraypainted sign on the garage wall which JaQuavis remembered from his time at the car wash offered words of warningWe still love Flint Michigan JaQuavis says Its so seedy so treacherous But theres some heart in this city This is where it all started selling books out the box In the days when we would get those little 40000 advances theyd send us a couple boxes of books for free We would hit the streets to sell our books right out of the car trunk It was a hustle It still isOne old neighborhood asset that the Colemans have not shaken off is swagger My wife is the best female writer in the game JaQuavis told me I believe Im the best male writer in the game Im sleeping next to the best writer in the world And shes doing the same,banking,"['urban', 'fiction',
