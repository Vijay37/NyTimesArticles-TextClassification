AdvertisementDoes he share our values and our principles on limited government, the proper role of the executive, adherence to the Constitution?As the speaker of the Republican-dominated House, Ryan could have posed a harder question: Do Republican voters “share our values and our principles”?The answer to this question, based at least on the 10.7 million votes cast for Trump in Republican primaries and caucuses so far, is “no.”But that’s not all. There is also strong evidence that most traditional public opinion surveys inadvertently hide a segment of Trump’s supporters. Many voters are reluctant to admit to a live interviewer that they back a candidate who has adopted such divisive positions.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhy is this important? Because an online survey, whatever other flaws it might have, resembles an anonymous voting booth far more than what you tell a pollster does.Trump’s advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling is eight or nine percentage points among likely voters.This difference, Dropp notes, is driven largely by more educated voters — those who would be most concerned with “social desirability.”These findings suggest that Trump will head into the general election with support from voters who are reluctant to admit their preferences to a live person in a phone survey, but who may well be inclined to cast a ballot for Trump on Election Day.AdvertisementI asked a number of experts about the disparity between online and phone polls. All of them — Alan Abramowitz, John Sides, Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck, political scientists who specialize in the analysis of poll data — agreed that in the case of highly contentious issues, respondents can be more willing to express their real views anonymously, to a computer rather than to a human.may be due to social desirability bias — people are more willing to express support for this privately than when asked by someone else.The accompanying chart, which uses data provided to The Times by Marc Hetherington and Drew Engelhardt, political scientists at Vanderbilt, shows that white Republicans are the most ethnocentric of all voters, but also that there are substantial numbers of ethnocentric white Democrats and white independents.A 2016 survey rated whites by ethnocentrism, the belief that whites are superior to others. Here is how white respondents evaluated these groups — blacks; Hispanics; Muslims; gays and lesbians; and transgender people — as a whole, relative to whites. The survey sorted respondents by political affiliation.FavorableNeutralUnfavorable41Dem.38%2059Ind.16%2573Repub.11%16All whiterespondents232057FavorableNeutralUnfavorable41Democrats38%2059Independents16%2573Republicans11%16All white respondents23%2057This suggests that Trump could potentially find significant levels of support not only among Republican voters, but also among white Democrats and independents.AdvertisementWhites were surveyed and placed on a 17-point scale that gauges the racial resentment they feel toward African-Americans. Here is the percentage of Democrats, independents and Republicans who fell into the least resentful (having a positive view of blacks) and most resentful ends of the scale.Democrats10%5LEVEL OF RESENTMENT:MostLeast22%23% of Democrats15%Independents105MostLeast42%10%24%of white Republicans were at the extreme end of the resentment scale.20%Republicans15105MostLeast58%0.4%24%of white Republicans were at the extreme end of the resentment scale.20%DemocratsIndependentsRepublicans15105LEVEL OF RESENTMENT:MostMostMostLeastLeastLeast22425823%10%0.4%of DemocratsWhat should prove worrisome for Democrats is that 42 percent of white independents also fall into the four most resentful categories, as do 22 percent of white Democrats.Even polls using traditional phone survey methods find notable support for issues high on Trump’s agenda. You can see this, for example, in attitudes toward the Chinese, Muslims and Mexicans — all of whom Trump has demonized.Or take another Trump theme: Islam. The P.R.R.I. values survey asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement “the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life.” Among all voters, 56 percent said that they agreed. Republican were strongest at 76 percent, but independents came in at 57 percent, with Democrats trailing at a still robust 43 percent.AdvertisementThere are a few conclusions to be drawn.First, the way Trump has positioned himself outside of the traditional boundaries of politics will make it unusually difficult to gauge public support for him and for many of his positions.Second, the allegiance of many white Democrats and independents is difficult to predict — cross-pressured as they are by the conflict between unsavory Trump positions they are drawn to and conscience or compunction. The ambivalence of many Republicans toward Trump as their party’s brazenly defiant nominee will further compound the volatility of the electorate.Finally, the simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again. If he does take the White House, much, if not all, of his margin of victory will come from voters too ashamed to acknowledge publicly how they intend to cast their vote.Thomas B.
