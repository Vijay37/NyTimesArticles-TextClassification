I want to focus on a well-made movie in silence.Instead, I have to endure a reserved seat where I am stuck, typically around people chomping on their popcorn, fidgeting with candy wrappers, talking and checking the latest text on their cellphones.I have to sit through more commercials that I can skip at home watching my taped version of the evening news. Well-made animated shorts are no longer worthy of inclusion despite the high ticket prices.Why not reserve at least a section of the theater for those of us who just want to sit with others in silence? And during those slower hours of the day, why not throw in a short subject and a cartoon and curtail the commercials and previews? I would be a major fan once again.RONALD E.
