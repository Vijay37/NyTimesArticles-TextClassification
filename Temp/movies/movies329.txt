These works recast New Jersey’s little towns as Peyton Places with secrets in every cupboard, and they raise the question: If the suburbs are so boring, why is this stuff so fascinating?”But nothing in “The Sopranos” was sexier than the setting itself. “My intention is to present New Jersey as a place of contrasts, like it really is,” Mr. Chase was quoted as saying. “I have a feeling that people think it’s only a toxic dump. That’s why I include shots of the waterfall and the more bucolic scenes. For such a small place, it has a lot of facets to it. And that’s only northern New Jersey. I wish we could go down the shore, but on our budget we can’t, sort of like when I was in high school.”And then there was that little-known comedian from Lawrenceville, Jon Stewart, before he transformed comedy television with “The Daily Show.” No wonder that by 1999, New Jersey had “gone from a private shame to a juggernaut,” as the playwright Paul Rudnick, from Piscataway, was quoted as saying.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
