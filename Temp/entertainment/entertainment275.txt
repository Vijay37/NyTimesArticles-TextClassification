AdvertisementExplore street view and find things to do in Tokyo.Wander through the narrow lanes of Nakameguro, a laid-back neighborhood bisected by the leafy canal of the Meguro River, to dinner at Nakameguro Iguchi, a stylish second-floor yakitori restaurant. A single bonsai serves as décor behind the 10-seat bar, where the friendly chef twirls skewers over the charcoal grill. The set menu, nearly two-dozen courses, recently included the usual chicken bits — tail, heart, wing — and creative offerings like grilled caciocavallo cheese from Hokkaido and refreshing chawanmushi (egg custard) with avocado, seasonal asparagus and lemon peel. Dinner for two, about 15,000 yen.Dinners at Tokyo’s top sushi bars typically end with bills printed with an immodest number of zeros, but you can fulfill your sushi dreams for a fraction of the price by eating at midday. Reserve a spot at Sushi Rin, a hushed second-story space in Kagurazaka with about a dozen seats around a blond-wood bar. At lunchtime, the omakase meal (4,000 yen) features fewer courses but the same craftsmanship and top-notch products, from a spoonful of salty roe atop vinegared rice to a parade of nigiri including red snapper, silvery kohada fish and rich tuna belly brushed with soy sauce. Equally memorable is the artful presentation on beautiful plates beside crimson cut-glass sake sets.Take the train one stop east to Nakano, a neighborhood favored by otaku (young pop-culture fanatics), to find a pair of drinking spots worth obsessing over. Hidden amid the manga stores and costume shops in a labyrinthine subculture shopping complex is Bar Zingaro, a cafe that fuses Norwegian exports — midcentury Scandinavian furnishings, Fuglen coffee — with the colorful art of Takashi Murakami. Tucked down a nearby alley, Nakano Beer Kobo is a tiny bar that feels like a treehouse with particleboard walls and lofts that you can climb into with plates of fried chicken thighs and mugs of cold beer brewed on site.Advertisement
