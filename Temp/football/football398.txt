B. 1954The idea was to be accessible rather than rarefied — to show people how to personalize clothes and accessories not by reading fashion magazines but by experimenting. Bellettini’s sister, Gina DeHerrera, told me Alisa lived the same way: “She didn’t feel that what you were wearing had to be expensive. Her style was about mixing and matching and feeling incredible in it. Pearl bracelet with a Swatch watch worn backward; a Gap T-shirt with a designer blazer — she had an incredible knack of putting clothes together and looking genius in them.”“House of Style” rethought fashion-magazine dogmatism and democratized style, but never too mockingly, never too righteously. It wasn’t “Style with Elsa Klensch,” but it wasn’t “Zoolander,” either. Bellettini took this world seriously, journalistically. Her show spent segments unpacking the budgets of fashion shows and letting models explain their salaries. It gave us “Todd Time” with Todd Oldham, the dreamy young designer who made daffy videos about swimwear and taught us stuff like how to reupholster a chair. The designers Karl Lagerfeld, Vivienne Westwood, Herve Leger and Martine Sitbon — they were all news to me. “House of Style” equated the value of what they did with the value of what was going on in the clubs and on the streets.Oldham told me that all of this — the show’s happy, off-center, insatiably curious personality, its nonstop introductions and conflations — came straight from Bellettini. A woman who had come into fashion television almost by happenstance created a show that expressed not just who she was but who some of us aspired to be. Oldham remembered a labor-intensive and expensively arty garment he once created, one Bellettini took a shine to: “an elaborate embroidered and beaded skirt I made and put Mona Lisa on one side and a wonky thrift-store painting on the other. Basically a $5,000 joke.” But she wore it every day, “like jeans.” Bellettini’s insouciance is what, for Oldham, made “House of Style” unique: its “honest assessment that style has nothing to do with money.” That, he said, “was straight up Alisa.”Wesley Morris is a critic at large for The New York Times and a staff writer for the magazine.B. 1938B. 1930There is a photograph of the astronaut Edgar Mitchell emerging from the Apollo 14 capsule, a ragged cone of scorched metal and shredded foil bobbing in the South Pacific 880 miles off the coast of American Samoa. A wetsuit-clad Navy swimmer is helping him out of the access hatch and into an inflatable raft. Mitchell, dressed in an olive-drab flight suit and a biological mask, steadies himself with his left hand on the door frame. He is 40, with the receding hairline and blandly gentle affect of a family dentist. It is Feb. 9, 1971, and he has just had an epiphany.B. 1962B. 1947... and it is a collaboration that makes me additionally thankful for this splendid enigma: What did you and Eno chat about in between takes? Your favorite Hammer films? Is a hot dog a sandwich, yes or no?B. 1924B. 20??B. 1906B. 1944 & 1953B. 1950B. 1974B. 1917B. 1936Photo EssayReno’s mother began building the family home, near the Florida Everglades, in 1949, long before Miami’s suburban sprawl crept into the area. Reno moved here at age 14, and — apart from stints in Tallahassee and as U.S. Attorney General — lived here for the rest of her life. The bed and other antiques once belonged to her maternal grandparents. ‘‘I don’t know how old they are,’’ says her sister, Maggy Hurchalla, ‘‘but I’ve known them for as long as I remember, and I just turned 76.’’Across the length of 2016, the photographer Mitch Epstein — known for making careful large-format images that draw rich meaning out of places and objects — arranged to visit the living and working spaces of some of the monumental figures we lost this year. The goal was to arrive not long after each person’s death, in those days when a person’s spirit can still seem palpable somewhere among their rooms and their things — as in his photograph of the writer Jim Harrison’s studio, where the items on a bedside table seem as if they were set down only moments ago.B. 1925B. 1924B. 1965B. 1958B. 1947B. 1945B. 1926B. 1942B. 1955B. 1928 & 1940B. 1926B. 1947B. 1952B. 1929Advertisement
