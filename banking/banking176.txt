The league had come up against opposition because of the brutality of its fights, with Senator John McCain of Arizona deriding it as “human cocktfighting,” but the Fertitta brothers put in place rules meant to curb the excesses of early fights and get approval from each state’s athletic commission. They also pushed promotions and distribution until revenue came to about $600 million last year. This year, New York lifted its ban on the sport.The company’s New York traded stock was priced at $32.84, with Line selling 25.3 million shares in the United States, including the greenshoe.The lawsuit showed what the judge called “the volatility and downward spiraling” of the relationship between the brothers, who had founded Gravity Payments, a credit card payment processing company. The brothers had agreed to restructure the company so that Dan would have a majority 60 percent share and serve as chief executive. Lucas would retain a minority 40 percent interest, but would not be involved in the day-to-day management.Lucas’s lawyer, Gregory J. Hollon, argued that Dan failed to meet the terms of the brothers’ agreement over the restructuring of the company. In a statement on Sunday, Lucas Price said, “I am shocked and disappointed with the decision and I will be considering my options.”MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS »VENTURE CAPITAL »LEGAL/REGULATORY »Advertisement
