The other was to deliver the news quickly for time-crunched readers, but with context, a dash of history and a sprinkle of humor.While I didn’t invent any new words or expressions like “goodbye,” I got to play a leading role in helping to reinvent a newspaper founded in 1851.To that end, I started work by 3 a.m. on weekdays. The air at that hour is heavy with promise. (Or maybe it was just that my eyelids were heavy.) My fast-approaching deadline and the editors and photo editor waiting for me to file ensured that my eyes stayed wide open.The benefits of the early start were having time to read all of the very latest news, mapping out which subjects to include and writing some spot analysis.The “Back Story” sought to illuminate the day’s events, like highlighting Alexander von Humboldt’s prediction in 1800 of man-made climate change for the day the Paris climate talks began, or the State Dinner where all the guests arrived by boat, for the day the White House hosted Canada’s new prime minister.But I also liked to have some fun, writing about a giant kite battle that has taken place for centuries in Japan; the physics of the Slinky; the origin of “serendipity”; and why Ohio has the only nonrectangular state flag. I read as much as possible to find details to make the subjects come alive.Goodbye.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
