Mr. Caspersen was a partner at the Park Hill Group, which specializes in raising money for private equity firms and hedge funds, and was still trying to persuade institutional investors to give him money up until last week.According to authorities, Mr. Caspersen had set up a shell company with a similar name to a legitimate vehicle at Park Hill and began raising money for it.

It has not yet received the money.The authorities said he blew through most of the money he raised “as a result of aggressive options trading” in his personal brokerage account.Park Hill, which was part of the Blackstone Group and is now part of PJT Partners, has fired Mr. Caspersen and said it was cooperating with the authorities.Starwood said that the Anbang group had offered $81 a share on Saturday, and then the current $82.75 after talks between the two sides began.ValueAct, founded by Jeffrey Ubben, has been invested in Valeant since 2006 and has held at least one seat on its board since 2007.
