Sometimes, the oldies are still the goodies.At least, that’s what American Crossroads is banking on. The “super PAC” co-founded by Karl Rove is set to go up on the air Tuesday in Arkansas with a $1.1 million buy to rerun an ad it first debuted in June.The commercial, “Spelling Bee,” was produced by the Republican ad man Larry McCarthy and widely praised by Republican and Democratic operatives alike.It features a young girl in a spelling bee contest, who is given the word “Pryor” — as in Senator Mark Pryor.After asking for the definition — “A Washington liberal out of touch with Arkansas, voted for the Obama agenda 90 percent,” says the judge — the girl finally spells the word: “O-B-A-M-A.”The first time the ad aired, American Crossroads put $440,000 behind the spot, an amount it is doubling for their upcoming buy, which will run for a week.Now, Crossroads will see if the second time is  the charm.First Draft provides fast-paced and comprehensive coverage of politics and elections by The New York Times.
