One discusses a trip with a doctor to a “club” where they stayed until the early morning so that “he had to have had one of the best nights of his life,” after which he wrote 17 Subsys prescriptions the next week. Another message described targeting a doctor who “runs a very shady pill mill” and is “extremely moody, lazy and inattentive,” yet he was recruited to the speaker series and two years later was averaging over 10 prescriptions per week.Defense lawyers denied that their clients violated the law by paying kickbacks or improperly influencing doctors. One described the indictment as “the government’s unproven factual assertions and legal theories.”What takes the case outside the usual allegations of fraud found in any number of health care prosecutions is the RICO conspiracy charge, which accuses the defendants of forming an enterprise to violate federal and state laws over a three-year period to enrich themselves. To prove the crime, prosecutors have to show that the defendants agreed to engage in a “pattern of racketeering activity,” which the indictment lists as violations of the federal mail and wire fraud statutes along with commercial bribery laws in Connecticut, Florida, New Hampshire and Texas.It is not always easy to link crimes together to prove a RICO conspiracy, but if the jury finds the defendants guilty of the charge, then each could be held accountable for the conduct of any other member of the enterprise even if they were not directly involved. A RICO conviction also results in a longer recommended sentence, starting at about three years in prison and quickly stretching to over a decade for multiple violations.It is not clear what the “special RICO purpose” was in the indictment of the former Insys executives. In a statement accompanying the charges, the United States attorney in Boston, Carmen M. Ortiz, may have hinted at one reason when she said, “I hope that today’s charges send a clear message that we will continue to attack the opioid epidemic from all angles, whether it is corporate greed or street-level dealing.”The Justice Department could be using the case to send a message to pharmaceutical manufacturers that individuals responsible for corporate violations are going to be targeted, and not just the companies, for how they peddle their wares by recruiting doctors to push out more prescriptions, especially for off-label uses of drugs. The demand for greater individual accountability for corporate wrongdoing may be coming to fruition, with the RICO charge against senior managers and the chief executive at Insys a prime example of how far prosecutors are willing to go.Questions have been raised recently about companies raising drug prices, so the government may be signaling that executives had better be careful about how they try to generate increased profitability on the backs of patients and insurance companies. RICO can be a very big stick for the Justice Department to fight back against corporate greed.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
