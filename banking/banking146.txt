Globally, companies conducted $682.3 billion worth of transactions during the three months through March, according to data compiled as of Wednesday by Thomson Reuters.“The market held up pretty well and confidence held up pretty well,” said Mark G. Shafir, the global co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup.General Electric filed a “request for rescission,” stating that GE Capital “has substantially reduced its risk profile and is significantly less interconnected to the financial system, and therefore does not pose any conceivable threat to U.S. financial stability.”The request comes just after the insurer MetLife won a court order to lift its designation.GE Capital and MetLife are two of four nonbank financial institutions that have been labeled as systemically important.The Treasury Department, which leads the Financial Stability Oversight Council, said that it welcomed the opportunity to evaluate GE Capital and that it re-examined the designations every year.Still, the true impact won’t be known until the MetLife ruling is unsealed. A ruling that disagrees with the council’s methods, rather than its right to identify systemically risky firms, could substantially embolden the anti-overhaul forces to strike elsewhere.Advertisement
