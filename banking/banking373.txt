The auction generated little of the attention that accompanied the government’s first auction in June, when it sold nearly 30,000 Bitcoins. At the time, Bitcoin was enjoying a speculative boom that had sent its price to about $1,150 at the end of 2013. Although the price of one Bitcoin had fallen to about $570 at the start of the first auction, investors were still willing to bet heavily on the currency. Since then, however, the price of Bitcoin has tumbled and was trading at about $280 on Thursday. A spokeswoman for the Marshals Service wrote in an email that the service anticipated selling the remaining 44,341 Bitcoins it had recovered “in the coming months.”Advertisement
