Public concern over the potential for corruption in this flood of cash has resulted, over the past half century, in five separate approaches to the regulation of campaign finance.Each of these five approaches has created winners and losers: business, labor, the superrich, reformers, consultants, corporations, incumbents, challengers, bundlers, lobbyists and the television industry have all seen their fortunes ebb and flow. The quest for cleaner politics has also had unanticipated side effects, like the intensification of political polarization and the weakening of the two major political parties.The five different campaign finance regimes differ radically from one another.There are some clear conclusions to be drawn from the 50-year struggle by reformers to place limits on the role of money in politics.Foremost is that when the goal of reformers has been to bar large donations from corporations, unions and the rich, their efforts have a brief half-life and end in failure.The 1974 post-Watergate reform law, for example, lasted through one presidential election, 1976. By 1980, large donors and the political parties had discovered the soft-money loophole, effectively eviscerating limits on campaign contributions and the ban on corporate and union donations — just the kind of contributions the authors of the 1974 law had sought to prohibit.The outlawing of soft money not only eliminated needed funding, it predictably enhanced the role of large existing outside groups (NRA, Sierra Club, etc.) and immediately spawned the creation of new groups (527 organizations, tax exempt social welfare organizations, etc.).”Subsequent court decisions,” Baran added, further exacerbated the “imbalance between the roles of independent groups and the parties.”As campaign finance law has been repeatedly roiled, who has gained and who has lost?Two industries produced the most effective bundlers: investment banking and lawyers, especially those who lobby. C.E.O.s of investment banking firms, have thousands of highly paid subordinates who will quickly respond to requests for donations to a specific candidate. Lobbyists, in turn, can tap the executive level employees of all their client firms.Most recently, the empowerment of corporate America culminated in Citizens United and SpeechNow, allowing corporations and the very rich to spend unlimited amounts on politics.Does all of the above suggest that nothing can be done about campaign finance?This does not rule out another possibility: changing the law to put political parties on the same plane as super PACs and other independent groups.Developments in recent years have “weakened the national party committees precisely at a time when the party coalitions needed them most,” Ray La Raja, a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, wrote me in an email. “If you want greater transparency, accountability and coalition-building it makes good sense to channel funds primarily through the party committees.”Campaign finance reformers, who have often been on the front lines of efforts to diminish the role of parties, “consistently forget about the vital role played by parties when they try to pass measures that are ostensibly about giving power to the people,” La Raja argues.Altering campaign finance law to put parties back on center stage would produce a revival of certain aspects of politics that reformers revile: pork barrel legislation, the use of campaign money to enforce party discipline and the use of votes in the House and Senate as bargaining chips.More important, strengthening the parties means giving a bigger role to institutions whose central goal is to win majority support, as opposed to pressing an unyielding social, moral, cultural — or economic — agenda.Reinvigorating political parties by lifting all restrictions on the contributions they receive and on the way they spend their money — with maximum transparency — is the best option to encourage politicians to respond more to the public will and less to special interests.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
