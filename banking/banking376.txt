AdvertisementSupported byMovie ReviewDRIVE HARDOpens on FridayDirected by Brian Trenchard-Smith1 hour 36 minutes; not ratedNot that we see much of the scenery once Simon (Mr. Cusack) coerces Peter (Thomas Jane), a former racecar driver reduced to teaching beginners, into becoming his wheelman in a bank robbery. Depressed and feeling put-upon by a wife (a thankless role for Yesse Spence) who wants him to take a more lucrative office job, Peter offers only halfhearted resistance to Simon’s yacky confidence and misogynistic opinion that Peter is more nagged than respected.As written by Mr. Trenchard-Smith and three others, “Drive Hard” is the kind of movie that presents titular puns, foulmouthed old ladies and collateral deaths as hilarious, especially when employed as pit stops on the machismo highway. International banking mischief plays out in the background, but mostly, we’re cornered in that car, at the mercy of claustrophobic close-ups and dialogue that sounds composed on the fly.People die almost as a side issue, their expiration mere fodder for Peter’s transformation from eunuch to stud. Apparently, when it comes to giving your wife a blockbuster climax, a B-movie mind-set is all that you need.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
