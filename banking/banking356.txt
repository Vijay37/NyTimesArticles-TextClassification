I don’t need to look at the spreadsheet. I’ll look at the building and know whether I want to buy a building. So we complement each other very, very well.We like to give our tenants a high-quality office environment. We don’t want them to think that they’re in a low-quality, traditional, old-fashioned B building, where they feel like they’re giving something up.We invest in the buildings. Every one of the buildings has gotten new lobbies, elevators, upgrades, windows, all the public areas.It’s about an 84,000-square-foot building, so it’s rather on the small side, and on that we’re spending $4 million.Our tenants, on average, are about 6,000 to 7,000 square feet.Just before the Christmas break we just finished a recapitalization. We bought Prudential out of 28 West 44th Street — the Club Row Building. We owned the building with them for three years and they were closing down a fund and they needed to exit the fund and we wanted to stay in the building.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
