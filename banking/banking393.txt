Try as you might to turn Vick into a good guy for supporting Geno Smith, to many people who care about animal suffering, Vick will always be considered a criminal.DAVID B. STAFFORDScarsdale, N.Y.Steroids’ BeneficiariesTo the Sports Editor:Re “At Hall, a Blank Look Is in Style,” July 24: Last weekend, some pretty good ballplayers who were not suspected of taking steroids were inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.But three managers were also inducted, and at least one benefited from star players’ use of performance enhancers. Tony La Russa managed Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire with Oakland and managed McGwire again with St. Louis, winning titles with both franchises.I don’t think enough has been made of the role of managers (and, for that matter, general managers, owners and Commissioner Bud Selig) in the steroid era.MAX GREENBERGPalo Alto, Calif.Sport Isn’t Just ScoundrelsTo the Sports Editor:Re “Assistant in Cruelty Case Is Rehired,” July 30: Horse racing is troubled by complex issues, including the use of legal drugs and illegal drugs, unethical trainers, breeding practices that sacrifice sturdiness for speed, and the certainty that racing is implicitly dangerous for horses and jockeys.Joe Drape consistently makes it appear that racing is populated by crooks and cheats and that they are its chief problem. There are some criminal-minded people in racing, as in banking, marketing, energy and government. Racing is in an inevitable decline. Let’s try to take a reasoned approach to slow its demise.NORM VANCEGrand Rapids, Mich.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
