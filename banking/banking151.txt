The question in the case, Salman v. United States, No. 15-628, is whether prosecutors had to prove that the brother-in-law, Maher Kara, disclosed the information in exchange for a personal benefit.The Second Circuit read the passage narrowly, saying it required “proof of a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective, consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable nature.”The United States attorney in Manhattan oversaw a sweeping crackdown on insider trading in the hedge fund industry, but a federal appeals court upended the campaign.The Ninth Circuit focused on a passage in the Dirks decision that allowed liability “when an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or a friend.”“In our case,” the Ninth Circuit said, “the government presented direct evidence that the disclosure was intended as a gift of market-sensitive information,” adding that the Second Circuit’s approach would have negative consequences.“If Salman’s theory were accepted and this evidence found to be insufficient,” the court said, “then a corporate insider or other person in possession of confidential and proprietary information would be free to disclose that information to her relatives, and they would be free to trade on it, provided only that she asked for no tangible compensation in return.”As is its custom, the Supreme Court gave no reasons for agreeing to hear the case.The Justice Department unsuccessfully sought review of the Second Circuit’s ruling in the Newman case, arguing that it represented a significant change in decades of insider trading case law. Allowing the ruling to stand, the petition said, will “hurt market participants, disadvantage scrupulous market analysts and impair the government’s ability to protect the fairness and integrity of the securities markets.”The Supreme Court on Tuesday again declined to take the Justice Department’s advice.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
