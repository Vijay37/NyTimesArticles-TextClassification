AdvertisementSupported byJefferies Group said on Tuesday that its sales and trading revenue fell 36 in the fourth quarter, dealing a blow to its results.The investment bank, a unit of the Leucadia National Corporation, reports its quarterly results roughly a month before the big banks do, and for that reason it is seen as an sign of how trading has fared on Wall Street. The outlook has turned bleaker of late for trading broadly, with some investment banks hinting at disappointing results to come because of market volatility.Jefferies has been dogged by a difficult trading environment in recent quarters. The firm said that fixed-income trading revenue in the quarter ending in November fell 83 percent, while equities trading fell 22 percent.Over all, sales and trading revenue of $132 million was down 36 percent from the quarter a year ago.“Our full-year results did not meet our expectations and we have made significant changes and are committed to improving our performance in 2016,” Richard B. Handler, Jefferies’ chairman and chief executive, and Brian Friedman, the chairman of its executive committee, said in a joint statement on Tuesday.Mr. Handler acknowledged that fixed income, once a solid business for the firm, did not perform well in the quarter, blaming low interest rates and turbulent energy markets. Trading volume dried up and there were periods of extreme volatility, he said.For the quarter, Jefferies had a profit of $24.7 million compared with a loss of $100 million in the quarter a year ago.The firm had made a big bet on the oil and energy markets in recent years, and that has come back to bite it in the current environment. Earlier this year, it agreed to sell its Bache commodities and derivatives unit to Société Générale of France.The sale of that business “removes a significant drag on Jefferies profitability,” the executives said.The company has also cut its exposure to distressed energy trading in recent quarters.Revenue from investment banking rose 18 percent, to $372 million.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
