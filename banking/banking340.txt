The six-page filing also offered only a snapshot of the problems that Mr. Cherkasky listed in a confidential 1,000-page report submitted to prosecutors in January. That report offered a more scathing assessment of the bank’s progress, people briefed on the matter said.Agents with the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security accused the exporters of violating federal law by using straw buyers, or people paid small sums to buy cars, to hide their intentions to sell the vehicles overseas.However, in nine states, prosecutors have agreed to return seized cars and money to these exporters after a recent Justice Department review of its asset forfeiture program. “As a result of this ongoing review, the department is encouraging prosecutors to pursue civil and criminal sanctions for straw-buyer fraud cases that lead to other criminal violations,” Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said in a statement.Advertisement
