AdvertisementSupported byGraham is not going to take the inevitability of moral decay sitting down:It has dawned on me that we don’t have to do business with them. At the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, we are moving our accounts from Wells Fargo to another bank. And guess what — we don’t have to shop at Tiffany & Co., there are plenty of other jewelry stores. This is one way we as Christians can speak out — we have the power of choice. Let’s just stop doing business with those who promote sin and stand against Almighty God’s laws and His standards.Graham’s failure to find a bank opposed to gay marriage points to the accelerating isolation of unreconstructed cultural conservatives.The scope of the liberalization of corporate America on social and cultural issues is reflected in the list of firms that signed the amicus brief. The firms argue that laws in 34 states barring same-sex marriage “hamper employer efforts to recruit and retain the most talented workforce possible in those states. Our successes depend upon the welfare and morale of all employees, without distinction.”Carl Forti, an operative who has worked for Karl Rove’s American Crossroads and for the pro-Romney “super PAC” Restore our Future, told Martin that the Supreme Court has changed “the landscape for the general election, which is a blessing.”Supreme Court decisions on the Affordable Care Act and gay marriage allow Republican candidates “to say these issues have been settled and move on to things that offer more of a political home-field advantage,” Tim Pawlenty, the former Republican governor of Minnesota and now chief executive of the Financial Services Roundtable, told Martin.While Democrats, and some Republicans, welcomed the gay marriage decision, leaders on the social right see a broad public repudiation of the religiosity that had for many years set consistent moral standards for parishioners, especially in the South.Liberal scholars and commentators have shied away from grappling with the extent to which the Southern Baptist Church has been a mainstay of families and communities both white and black.As the church has weakened, so too has the family. The South now suffers the highest rates of marital dissolution, nonmarital childbearing and father absence. Five of the 10 states with the highest numbers of women murdered by men are in the South.There is evidence, according to Bradford Wilcox, a professor of sociology at the University of Virginia, in support of the argument that conservative Protestant denominations in the South have played a key role in maintaining stable families.Survey data that Wilcox cites in his 2004 book, “Soft Patriarchs, New Men,” indicates that family disorder in the South has been notably evident in one specific group: those born into conservative religions but who have since abandoned or neglected their ties. In contrast, those who remain religiously engaged show strikingly low levels of family dysfunction – in some cases well below national averages.Along similar lines, wives among active, church-going conservative Protestants reported a significantly higher level of happiness with the husbands’ “love and affection” than wives in families that have only nominal religious ties.evidence of a direct causal impact because attenders are a selected group. In other words, folks considering divorce or in troubled marriages are less likely to go to church, where such matters are hard to hide and divorce itself is discouraged.Glass did find in her research “that being an active member of a religious congregation no matter the faith suppressed divorce, especially if your spouse also attends with you.” But, she said, “the highest rates of divorce occurred for church attending conservative Protestant wives married to non-attending husbands.”The high point for the convention was with a membership of 16.6 million in 2005. Over the last decade, membership has dropped by 1.1 million, to 15.5 million.Many church leaders blame themselves for failing to take a strong enough stand against modernizing cultural trends.The Church and our culture have been drifting further and further into a moral and spiritual state of rebellion and corruption; and our Southern Baptist Convention has been in a state of steady decline in baptisms for the past fifteen years.Reagan famously went on to say, “I know you can’t endorse me because this is a nonpartisan crowd. But I want you to know that I endorse you and what you are doing.”Now, Fleischer says, “When a young voter sees a Republican coming, many of them roll their eyes and wonder why they can’t get with modern life.”Not all Republicans want to distance themselves from the Christian right. Presidential candidates Mike Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal and Scott Walker are competing for support from social conservatives.Republicans are not going to turn this thing around, Democrats are not going to turn it around. The Tea Party is not going to turn things around.Would the Republican Party be more competitive in general elections, as Forti and Fleischer suggest, if it could break the power of the Christian right to set the party’s social agenda?Tensions between the religious and establishment wings of the Republican Party have been growing steadily over the last decade, in large part because President Obama’s two victories have raised the possibility of a new Democratic presidential coalition.A conflict between religiously orthodox and heterodox Republicans is forcing the Republican Party onto risky terrain. The question is: Can the party sideline one of the most reliable voting blocs, the most religiously observant, on the assumption that it will attract the college-educated, socially liberal and fiscally moderate voters who have been shifting to the Democratic Party?The answer is that the Republican Party appears to be moving in a direction that will leave it no choice. Religiously committed voters are on the wane in an era of increasing secularization. Science and technology have uprooted faith and shattered tradition, and Republicans have benefited from the struggle to accommodate the onrush of modernity.Now, party professionals appear willing to make a series of gambles.Second, that the more conservative congressional wing of the Republican Party will support a change in the party’s agenda to a more mainstream focus on jobs and economic growth.Third, that in response to a modified agenda, voters driven into the arms of the Democrats by hostility to the Christian right will be willing to return to the Republican fold.There is no certainty to any of this, but it may be that the culture has moved far enough to the left that the Republican Party has no choice but to adjust.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
