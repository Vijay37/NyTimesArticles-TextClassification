AdvertisementSupported byPublic schoolteachers and other education workers in Connecticut should soon have an easier time figuring out how much they are paying for their retirement investments.A bill passed by the Connecticut Legislature tries to improve this situation by requiring all 403(b) retirement plan providers to disclose fees and compensation to state and municipal workers. The legislation, which unanimously passed in the state Senate last week, is headed to Gov. Dannel P. Malloy for his signature.The legislation — which will take effect in 2019, but could be changed to 2018 as language in the bill is completed — would require companies that operate 403(b) plans to disclose the charges and returns (after subtracting fees) for each investment offered. It would also require plan administrators to disclose fees paid to any person “who for compensation provides investment advice.”“This bill grants teachers the same fee and conflict-of-interest disclosures available to private sector workers having a 401(k) and allows the comptroller to make lower-cost plans available directly to local boards of education,” said Mr. Lesser, a Democrat.A spokeswoman for Kevin Lembo, the Connecticut state comptroller, said his office was analyzing ways to make those plans more readily available. “I am hopeful that we can encourage more opportunities for municipalities, particularly school districts, to partner with the state,” Mr. Lembo said in a statement, “including through both the 457 and 403(b) plans.”He said the state-run plan is a better option. “Compared to many of the products we see in local districts, it does provide a better platform by offering teachers the benefits of low-cost funds and diversification,” Mr. Gottfried said.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
