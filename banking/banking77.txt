AdvertisementSupported byGood Monday morning. Andrew has thoughts on the detention of Prince Alwaleed of Saudi Arabia over the weekend, especially after interviewing the billionaire less than two weeks ago. And we’re looking at the fallout from the Paradise Papers leaks.Two weeks ago, he seemed remarkably relaxed, no different than the few times I had interacted with him beforehand. He did make a point of praising Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his Vision 2030 plan for the country. He also was particularly spirited in his praise of President Trump, someone whom he had once called a “disgrace” and had called upon to drop out of the presidential race.One thing that was surprising, given that Prince Alwaleed had been the face of finance for Saudi Arabia for years, was that he was not part of the large investment conference organized by Crown Prince Mohammed. The gathering took place at the Ritz-Carlton — just 10 minutes down the road from Alwaleed’s office.“This is very risky,” the business leader said, because M.B.S. is now challenging senior princes and religious conservatives simultaneously. The executive, who strongly supports M.B.S.’s liberalization efforts, worried that “he’s fighting too many wars at once.”More on Alwaleed and the Saudi detentions__________________________________________But Andrew and Michael have spoken with others, including executives and investors in New York — some of whom have had long relationships with Prince Alwaleed — who suggested that the arrests will make the business community less certain about investing in Saudi Arabia.Helima Croft, global head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, who attended the Riyadh conference, was somewhat more circumspect. “Does this scare off a pension fund or can this be sold as creating the necessary conditions of success?” she asked. “It’s a high-stakes game.”More on AramcoMichael says that Qualcomm is expected to quickly reject the bid as too low. But deal makers have been whispering about how Broadcom and its C.E.O., Hock Tan, may have been laying the political groundwork for this deal.More smart things to think about• Pay attention to any role that Silver Lake, which has backed Mr. Tan for 12 years, plays in supporting Broadcom’s bid. Private equity firms usually don’t back unsolicited takeover offers, but will this time be different?• If Broadcom wins, will it be able to strike a peace deal with Apple, which has been in a long-running legal fight with Qualcomm?Wilbur RossOther Trump administration officialsBoth Gary Cohn, who was associated with 22 Bermuda entities while an executive at Goldman Sachs, and Rex Tillerson, who was a director of a Bermuda-based joint venture with the government of Yemen when he ran Exxon Mobil’s operations there, appear in the files. There is no evidence of illegality in any of their dealings.Yuri MilnerGlencoreWhat does SoftBank do now with a stand-alone Sprint? Here’s more from Jonathan Soble of the NYT, who attended a SoftBank news conference today:Mr. Son acknowledged that Sprint was “not in a strong position” as the No. 4 carrier in the U.S. market. He also acknowledged that combining Sprint and T-Mobile had been his “fundamental strategy” all along.While he would consider selling Sprint — depending on “the price, the opportunity and the buyer” — Mr. Son added that he was committed to staying in the American wireless market because of its importance to his long-term bet on the internet of things.M. & A.Policy and LegalBanks and BankingMoney ManagersBusiness and EconomyAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
