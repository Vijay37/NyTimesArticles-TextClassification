      "For years now, people have been talking about the insulated world of the top 1 percent of Americans, but the top 20 percent of the income distribution is also steadily separating itself — by geography and by education as well as by income.\n",
      "This self-segregation of a privileged fifth of the population is changing the American social order and the American political system, creating a self-perpetuating class at the top, which is ever more difficult to break into.\n",

      "At the same time, the percentage of families with children living in traditional middle class neighborhoods with median incomes between 80 and 125 percent of the surrounding metropolitan area fell from 64.7 percent in 1970 to 40.5 percent.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Segregation of affluence not only concentrates income and wealth in a small number of communities, but also concentrates social capital and political power. As a result, any self-interested investment the rich make in their own communities has little chance of “spilling over” to benefit middle‐ and low-income families. In addition, it is increasingly unlikely that high‐income families interact with middle‐ and low‐income families, eroding some of the social empathy that might lead to support for broader public investment in social programs to help the poor and middle class.\n",
      "Geographic segregation dovetails with the growing economic spread between the top 20 percent and the bottom 80 percent: The top quintile is, in effect, disengaging from everyone with lower incomes.\n",
      "we have seen a threefold increase between 1972 and 2007 in top-decile spending on children, an increase that suggests that parents at the top may be investing in ever more high-quality day care and babysitting, private schooling, books and tutoring, and college tuition and fees.\n",
      "The bottom line, Smeeding wrote in an email, is this:\n",
      "The well-to-do are isolated from the day to day struggles of the middle class and below to provide these key services (health, education, job search and other opportunities) to aid the upward mobility of their children. But the upper middle class are happy to take advantage of tax subsidies for their own housing, preschool for their kids, and saving for college which benefit them.\n",
      "Political leverage is another factor separating the top 20 percent from the rest of America. The top quintile is equipped to exercise much more influence over politics and policy than its share of the electorate would suggest. Although by definition this group represents 20 percent of all Americans, it represents about 30 percent of the electorate, in part because of high turnout levels. The accompanying chart, which shows voting patterns by income in the 2012 and 2014 elections, illustrates this phenomenon (it was created by Sean McElwee, a policy analyst at Demos, a liberal think tank).\n",
      "The top fifth have been prospering while the majority lags behind. But the separation is not just economic. Gaps are growing on a whole range of dimensions, including family structure, education, lifestyle, and geography. Indeed, these dimensions of advantage appear to be clustering more tightly together, each thereby amplifying the effect of the other.\n",
      "The same pattern emerges in the case of education. Reeves cites data showing that 56 percent of heads of households in the top quintile have college or advanced degrees, compared with 34 percent in the third and fourth quintiles and 17 percent in the bottom two quintiles.\n",
      "Similar patterns emerge in the percent of married households.\n",
      "“Family structure, as a marker and predictor of family stability, makes a difference to the life chances of the next generation,” Reeves writes:\n",
      "To the extent that upper middle class Americans are able to form planned, stable, committed families, their children will benefit — and be more likely to retain their childhood class status when they become adults.\n",
      "Using 2013 census data, Reeves finds that 83 percent of affluent heads of household between the ages of 35 and 40 are married, compared with 65 percent in the third and fourth income quintiles and 33 percent in the bottom two.\n",

      "As the top 20 percent becomes more isolated and entrenched, reforms designed to open opportunities for those in the middle and on the bottom “can all run into the solid wall of rational, self-interested upper middle class resistance,” Reeves argues.\n",

      "In the 1980s, voters in the top ranks of the income ladder lined up in favor of Republican presidential candidates by 2-1. In 1988, for example, George H.W. Bush crushed Michael Dukakis among voters making $100,000 or more by an impressive 34 points, 67-33.\n",
      "Move forward to 2008 and 2012. In 2008, voters from families making $100,000 to $200,000 split their votes 51-48 in favor of John McCain, while those making in excess of $200,000 cast a slight 52-46 majority for Barack Obama.\n",
      "In other words, Democrats are now competitive among the top 20 percent. This has changed the economic makeup of the Democratic Party and is certain to intensify tensions between the traditional downscale wing and the emergent upscale wing.\n",
      "The Republican Party in 2016 is an example of what can happen when the dominant wing fails to address the concerns of the majority. The rebellion against the Republican establishment is on the verge of producing the nomination of a man who is anathema to the majority of elected officials and party activists, a candidate with the potential to drag the party into minority status for years to come.\n",

      "• Attorney General Jeff Sessions, testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, showed selective recall on the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts.\n",
      "• Mr. Sessions said he had “no reason to doubt these women” who have accused the man who wants his old Senate seat, Roy S. Moore, of seeking sexual or romantic favors from them as teenagers.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions denied that he lied in October when he testified that he knew of nobody in the Trump campaign who had contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign. “And I don’t believe it happened,” he said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Court records later revealed that Mr. Sessions led a March 2016 meeting in which George Papadopoulos, a campaign aide, discussed his Russian ties and suggested setting up a meeting between Mr. Trump. and Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president.\n",
      "“I had no recollection of this meeting until I saw these news reports,” Mr. Sessions said.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions testified Tuesday that was still hazy on the details about what Mr. Papadopoulos had proposed.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But on one matter, he said his memory is clear: he said he shot down Mr. Papadopoulos’ idea of a Trump-Putin meeting. And he said he told Mr. Papadopoulos that he was not authorized to represent the campaign in such discussions.\n",
      "To sum up: Mr. Sessions said he could not remember much about Russian influence on the Trump campaign, except when he could block such influence.\n",
      "As Democrats repeatedly put heat on Mr. Sessions over the evolution of his testimony before Congress, Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, invoked an unexpected ostensible ally: Senator Jeff Sessions.\n",
      "Holding up a speech he said Mr. Sessions had given on the Senate floor during the proceedings to remove President Bill Clinton from office, Mr. Jeffries said Mr. Sessions had then justified his vote for removal by saying that he would not hold the president to a different standard than a young police officer he had prosecuted years before for lying under oath.\n",
      "“You stated that you refused to hold a president accountable to a different standard than the young police officer who you prosecuted,” Mr. Jeffries said. “Let me be clear: The attorney general of the United States of America should not be held to a different standard than the young police officer whose life you ruined by prosecuting him for perjury.”\n",
      "Mr. Sessions vehemently disagreed with the comparison, repeatedly calling Mr. Jeffries suggestion “unfair.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Mr. Jeffries, nobody, nobody, not you or anyone else should be prosecuted, not be accused of perjury for answering the question the way I did in this hearing,” Mr. Sessions said. “I have always tried to answer the questions fairly and accurately.”\n",
      "Several Republican lawmakers urged Mr. Sessions to crack down on leaks. Republicans have generally responded to various Trump-Russia revelations — like the Washington Post report disclosing that a wiretap of the Russian ambassador had picked up his conversations about sanctions with Michael Flynn, then Mr. Trump’s national security adviser — by saying the real scandal was the leaks.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions told Rep. Bob Goodlatte, the Virginia Republican who chairs the committee, that the leaking of classified information was “a very grave offense.” He also said touted a significant increase in the number of open leak investigations.\n",
      "“We had about nine open investigations of classified leaks in the last three years; we have 27 investigations open today,” Mr. Sessions said. “We intend to get to the bottom of these leaks. I think it has reached epidemic proportions. It cannot be allowed to continue and we will do our best effort to ensure it does not continue.”\n",
      "Later, Rep. Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, brought up Mr. Trump’s accusation that the press is the “enemy of the people,” said the Founders thought the free press was society’s best friend, and asked Mr. Sessions to commit to not prosecuting “investigative journalists for maintaining the confidentiality of their professional sources.”\n",
      "(That question garbled or conflated two different issues. One is whether journalists could be jailed for contempt if they refuse to provide witness testimony when subpoenaed in connection with an investigation into or prosecution of their suspected sources. The other is whether journalists could be prosecuted as alleged co-conspirators in a criminal leak.)\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I’ll commit to respecting the role of the press and conducting my office in a way that respects that,” Mr. Sessions responded. “We have not had a conflict in my term in office yet with the press but there are some things the press seems to think they have an absolute right to.” but it does not, he added.\n",
      "He offered no further details about where he draws the line.\n",
      "While the Trump campaign contacts with Russia is the main recurring theme, a separate subplot has emerged: surveillance.\n",
      "The Liberty Act would require government agents to obtain a warrant from a judge to scrutinize such messages when the information pertains to Americans connected to a criminal investigation, though not when it comes to a national-security investigation. The Trump administration opposes that idea.\n",
      "Among others, Rep. Ted Poe, Republican of Texas, pressed Mr. Sessions about that issue. Invoking the language of Fourth Amendment privacy rights, he noted that the information in the internet repository was seized without a warrant, and said querying the database amounts to a search. He demanded, “you don’t think probable cause and a warrant is required to go into that information?”\n",
      "Mr. Sessions replied that the federal courts “have so held,” adding “I agree with the courts, not you, congressman, on that.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Mr. Poe responded: “It is the responsibility of Congress to set the privacy standard for Americans.”\n",

      "Mr. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee, “I have no reason to doubt these women” who have accused Roy S. Moore of seeking sex or romance with them when they were teenagers.\n",
      "Mr. Moore is seeking to fill the Alabama Senate seat that Mr. Sessions gave up when he was confirmed as attorney general. And Mr. Sessions remains a popular figure in Alabama. The attorney general’s views matter in his home state.\n",
      "What’s more, Republican leaders in Washington are discussing whether Mr. Sessions should launch a write-in campaign to reclaim his seat. If that does not happen and Mr. Moore prevails in the Dec. 12 special election, there is talk of expelling the jurist from the Senate and prevailing on Alabama’s governor, Kay Ivey, to appoint Mr. Sessions back to the Senate.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions’ appearance before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday was really a twofer. There was the hearing on the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia, guided by the committee’s Democrats who single-mindedly bored in on the topic.\n",
      "Then there was the hearing-on-any-topic-other-than-Russia orchestrated by the committee’s Republicans, which scurried over federal eavesdropping law, rising crime, immigration and Hillary Clinton.\n",
      "Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California, summed up the Republican sentiment.\n",
      "“I don’t speak Russian and I haven’t met with Russians and I don’t really want to talk about that today,” he said, before diving into questions about sober living homes.\n",
      "The Democrats were not exclusively concerned with Russia. During his time with the attorney general, Representative Steve Cohen, Democrat of Tennessee, paused the grilling to ask Mr. Sessions about a subject long associated with him: pot. Comedy ensued.\n",

      "“You said one time that good people don’t smoke marijuana,” Mr. Cohen said. “Which of these people would you say are not good people?”\n",

      "“Quickly. John Kasich, a good person? George Pataki, Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, Jeb Bush, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Judge Clarence Thomas — which are not good people?” he demanded, citing prominent Republicans who, ostensibly, have admitted smoking dope.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions, laughing with much of the hearing room, chalked it up to context. “So the question was, what do you do about drug use, the epidemic we’re seeing in the country, and how you reverse it. Part of that is a cultural thing. I explained how when I became the United States attorney in 1981, and the drugs were being used widely, over a period of years, it became unfashionable, unpopular, and people were seeing — it was seen as such that good people didn’t use marijuana.”\n",
      "And with that, Mr. Cohen’s allotted time for questioning ended.\n",
      "Representative Robert Goodlatte, the committee’s Republican chairman, appeared to pile on when he said, “While I understand your decision to recuse yourself was an effort by you to do the right thing, I believe you, as a person of integrity, would have been impartial and fair in following the facts wherever they led.”\n",
      "Any hiccups in Mr. Sessions’s testimony would most likely only make his problems at the White House worse.\n",
      "And Representative John Conyers, the top Democrat on the panel, did not make things easier for the attorney general when he asked Mr. Sessions if the president should make “public comments that might influence a pending criminal investigation.”\n",
      "Mr. Sessions hesitated. “He should take great care in those issues,” he said, before adding a defense of Mr. Trump.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“I would say it’s improper,” Mr. Sessions said. “A president cannot improperly influence an investigation. And I have not been improperly influenced and would not be improperly influenced.”\n",
      "“There are significant concerns that the partisanship of the F.B.I. and the department has weakened the ability of each to act objectively,” he said.\n",
      "Democrats were incensed by the letter, which they said they did not receive. Mr. Conyers said the appointment of a new special counsel was merely to “cater to the President’s political needs.” He argued that there was not sufficient evidence to do so. And, he said, it smacked of “a banana republic.”\n",
      "Mr. Sessions said that any decisions about the investigations would be made “without regard to politics, ideology, or bias.”\n",
      "Representative Jim Jordan, Republican of Ohio, pressed Mr. Sessions on a litany of issues that “looks like” they need a special counsel to investigate, the attorney general was brusque: “ ‘Looks like’ is not enough to appoint a special counsel.”\n",
      "Mr. Sessions has twice told lawmakers under oath that as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Trump’s campaign, he did not communicate with Russians to aid Mr. Trump’s candidacy, nor did he know of other members of the campaign who had.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Now, Mr. Sessions must contend with comments he made last month, in another hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did,” Mr. Sessions told senators when asked whether he believed members of the campaign had communicated with Russians.\n",
      "“Under oath, knowing in advance that he would be asked about this subject, the Attorney General gave answers that were, at best, incomplete,” said Mr. Conyers. “I hope the Attorney General can provide some clarification on this problem in his remarks today.”\n",

      "So, what about Nancy Pelosi?\n",
      "One of the more dramatic sidelights in that dramatic congressional election in Pennsylvania was the way Republicans attempted to turn the whole campaign into a Pelosi referendum.\n",
      "If you lived in the Pittsburgh area, you saw multitudinous ads warning that Democrat Conor Lamb would “join Pelosi’s liberal flock” if he won. People there will probably spend the spring wandering around muttering “Nancy Pelosi and Conor Lamb Are Still Opposing Your Tax Cut.”\n",
      "“You cannot watch TV at any time of the day or night without seeing the ‘mudslinging’ campaigns,” one reader complained to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. It’s tough, all the advertising overkill that comes with a tight election. Those of us who live in districts where the typical contest is a 12-term incumbent versus anything the opposition can dig up — a woman who just moved into the state, a guy who just got out of prison on an arson conviction, a 12-year-old Chihuahua — are so lucky.\n",
      "For Pelosi, the only downside to Lamb’s victory was the part where he promised he’d never vote to keep her on as leader. (“My take is, if these people have been around for several years and they haven’t solved these problems that have been hanging around, it’s time for someone new to step up and get it done.”)\n",
      "So what does this all mean?\n",
      "A) Pelosi loses! How many other Democrats in tough races will promise to replace her? It’s a hell of a lot easier than balancing the budget.\n",
      "B) Pelosi wins! Look, she would have been perfectly happy to have Lamb call her a voodoo-priestess puppy-killer if it got her another seat.\n",
      "C) Republicans self-immolate! People who bet their political fortunes on the presumption that voters care who’s the House minority leader deserve what they get.\n",
      "O.K., it’s very possible that your average voter is not all that obsessed with Nancy Pelosi. But I know you’re different, concerned citizen. And she really has been through a lot. David Barker, a government professor at American University, thinks the Republican effort to portray Pelosi as an uber-villain “may be unique, historically speaking.” And the reason, Barker adds, has to be “at least partially related to gender.”\n",
      "Pelosi doesn’t really love the idea that the Republicans’ hatred is about sexism. “I don’t think it’s because I’m a woman. It’s because I’m an effective leader,” she said in a phone interview.\n",
      "Or it could be both. Pelosi is famous as a behind-the-scenes tactician. When the Democrats controlled the House and Barack Obama was president, she single-handedly dragged the Affordable Care Act to passage like a firefighter rescuing a comatose 300-pound fifth-floor resident from a burning building. And as a fund-raiser, she’s a veritable vacuum cleaner.\n",
      "She sounds as if she wants to stay. “I wouldn’t give that up lightly,” she said of her job. “Nor do the women of the country want me to.”\n",
      "But the Democrats in the House aren’t all enthusiastic. Some have been saying they want a leader who’s younger, more open to new ideas, less likely to become a political meme for the opposition. “I do think it’s time to pass the torch to a new generation,” said Representative Linda Sánchez, 49, in a recent TV interview.\n",
      "You do have to admit the Democratic leadership is looking a little … non-fresh. Pelosi turns 78 this month. The next two people in line — Steny Hoyer and James Clyburn — are equally senior.\n",
      "“And why is it that the only one being pressured to leave is a woman?” demanded one of Pelosi’s friends.\n",
      "Well, probably because she’s on top. Although if she was replaced by the 78-year-old Hoyer, that would be pretty embarrassing. And some of the younger Democrats who are mentioned most often as possible successors — like 56-year-old Representative Joe Crowley of Queens — aren’t exactly new brooms.\n",
      "The ideal solution — except for the other Democrats who are eyeing her job — might be for Pelosi to come back with a new message. Maybe she could follow the Republican lead and impose term limits on committee leadership jobs, giving junior members a chance to shine. The Democrats haven’t done this because of opposition from the Congressional Black Caucus, which argues that the current seniority system is good for minority members. It’s certainly good for the veteran minority members who have important posts they can keep forever. But the younger, ambitious black House Democrats are stuck in the same clogged system as their white counterparts.\n",
      "If the public thinks Pelosi is less than inspiring, that’s probably because making messy political bargains and fund-raising aren’t exactly celebrated skills these days. Polls show House Speaker Paul Ryan is equally (un)popular. And he’s now being Pelosi-ed by a Democratic super PAC with a new ad showing a man who’s supposed to be Ryan drinking champagne, admiring his hair and working out in the gym in the most self-obsessed manner possible. “Whoever Speaker Ryan thinks about — it probably isn’t you,” the narrator warns.\n",
      "Plus, there’s that election in November. Right now, it seems as if nothing can save the Republican majority. Not even promising to get rid of Paul Ryan. Although it probably wouldn’t hurt.\n",

But I didn’t tape, and I don’t have any tape and I didn’t tape.”\n",
      "When the Fox interviewer suggested that the possible existence of recordings might have made sure Mr. Comey “stayed honest in those hearings,” Mr. Trump paused before responding, “Well, it wasn’t very stupid, I can tell you that.” He also said that once Mr. Comey faced the possibility that tapes of their conversations existed, “I think his story may have changed.”\n",
      "By Friday evening, Mr. Trump had shifted his frustration in the election inquiry — upon which his critics have seized, and which he sees as an effort to undermine the legitimacy of his presidency — toward the Obama administration.\n",
      "“He’s very, very good friends with Comey, which is very bothersome,” Mr. Trump said.\n",
      "Mr. Trump said “there’s been no collusion, no obstruction — and virtually everybody agrees to that,” and he added that some of Mr. Mueller’s legal team had supported Mrs. Clinton.\n",
      "The president closed on a more positive note, saying, “Robert Mueller’s an honorable man, and hopefully he’ll come up with an honorable solution.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Trump rejected, for now at least, a fresh round of sanctions set to be imposed against Russia on Monday, a course change that underscored the schism between the president and his national security team.\n",
      "The president’s ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki R. Haley, had announced on Sunday that the administration would place sanctions on Russian companies found to be assisting Syria’s chemical weapons program. The sanctions were listed on a menu of further government options after an American-led airstrike on Syria, retaliating against a suspected gas attack that killed dozens a week earlier.\n",
      "But the White House contradicted her on Monday, saying that Mr. Trump had not approved additional measures.\n",
      "“We are considering additional sanctions on Russia and a decision will be made in the near future,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.\n",
      "Speaking later with reporters aboard Air Force One as Mr. Trump headed to Florida, Ms. Sanders added that “the president has been clear that he’s going to be tough on Russia, but at the same time he’d still like to have a good relationship with them.”\n",
      "Another White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal deliberations, said Mr. Trump had decided not to go forward with the sanctions. Mr. Trump concluded that they were unnecessary because Moscow’s response to the airstrike was mainly bluster, the official said.\n",
      "Russia analysts said the whipsaw policy shift once again highlighted an administration struggling to find a coherent and consistent voice in dealing with Russia, which in the past four years has annexed Crimea, intervened in eastern Ukraine, sought to influence the American election in 2016, allegedly poisoned a former Russian spy living in Britain and propped up the murderous government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.\n",
      "“Trump seems to think that if he accepts what his advisers recommend on even days of the month and rejects their recommendations on odd days, the result will be a strategy,” said Stephen Sestanovich, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations and Columbia University who served as ambassador to former Soviet states in the 1990s.\n",
      "“By and large, other governments don’t know whether to laugh or cry at all this,” Mr. Sestanovich said. “But in Russia, laughter is getting the upper hand.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump was annoyed with Ms. Haley for getting out in front of the policy, the administration official said, and the president’s decision to reject sanctions left her hanging in public with her credibility on the line.\n",
      "Ms. Haley has been one of the strongest critics in the administration of Russia’s behavior around the world, often speaking far more harshly than Mr. Trump would, but she has rarely been reined in publicly this way. She made no comment on Monday.\n",
      "Administration officials said new sanctions could still be imposed at some point if Russia takes further action justifying them.\n",
      "But absent such a scenario, the officials could not explain how Mr. Trump would make Russia pay a “big price” for enabling Syria’s use of chemical weapons, as he promised to do last week after a suspected gas attack killed more than 40 people and sickened scores more outside Damascus on April 7.\n",
      "The strike against Syria that Mr. Trump announced late Friday in Washington was limited to a single night and to three targets linked to chemical weapons facilities. It sought to punish President Bashar al-Assad of Syria for the suspected gas attack but avoid provoking Russia into a response.\n",
      "Russian forces stationed in Syria have helped Mr. Assad gain the upper hand in the country’s seven-year civil war.\n",
      "Russia responded harshly to the news of sanctions before learning that Mr. Trump had canceled them. “The sanctions drive against Russia is becoming an obsession,” Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, told reporters at his daily briefing in Moscow. “We’re convinced that any economist can see open attempts to squeeze Russian companies out of global markets.”\n",
      "Critics said the president’s decision not to follow through on Ms. Haley’s announcement would sap American authority around the world.\n",
      "“I am outraged that President Trump pulled back sanctions on Russia for its support of the Assad regime,” said Representative Eliot L. Engel of New York, the senior Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “This sends a message to governments around the world that they can support brutal, criminal behavior without serious consequences.\n",
      "“President Trump is out of step with the American people, American values — and as this situation has made clear, his own administration,” Mr. Engel said.\n",
      "The about-face on sanctions came a day after ABC News broadcast an interview with James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director fired by Mr. Trump last year, in which he said he thought “it’s possible” that the president had been compromised by Russia. A protester waiting for Mr. Trump in Florida on Monday held a large banner that read, “Russian stooge.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump has heatedly and repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia during his 2016 campaign, calling such suggestions a “hoax” perpetrated by Democratic sore losers desperate to explain an election defeat.\n",
      "Russia did not respond militarily to the Friday strike, but American officials noted a sharp spike in Russian online activity around the time it was launched.\n",
      "A snapshot on Friday night recorded a 2,000 percent increase in citing the hashtag #isupportsyria on Russian troll networks, according to a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security who was not authorized to discuss the issue by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. Additionally, the official said, the known Russian hashtag #SyriaStrikes had a 4,443 percent increase in activity while another, #Damsucs, saw a 2,800 percent jump.\n",
      "In hitting the Barzah Research and Development Center, a chemical weapons research lab in greater Damascus, and two storage facilities and bunkers near Homs, Pentagon officials insisted that they dealt a critical blow to Mr. Assad’s weapons program. But Friday night’s strike, delivered via 105 missiles, was not quite double the 59 missiles used last year when Mr. Trump ordered the military to strike a Syrian airfield from which planes engaged in another chemical weapons attack took off.\n",
      "Defense Secretary Jim Mattis pushed hard to limit the strikes to proven weapons facilities in the hopes that a more limited strike would not prompt retaliation from Russia.\n",
      "The lab at Barzah, in Damascus, was on the receiving end of the biggest barrage — some 76 missiles, a combination of Tomahawk cruise missiles and Joint air-to-surface missiles. The rest of the bombs — 29, fired by American, French and British warplanes — struck and destroyed the Him Shinshar chemical weapons storage facility near Homs, and the Him Shinshar chemical weapons bunker facility around five miles away.\n",
      "Syria tried to hit back, but by the time its air defense system was deployed, the American warplanes were on their way home and the war ships had completed their mission, military officials said. They disputed Syrian claims to have shot down dozens of American missiles.\n",
      "“We assess that over 40 surface-to-air missiles were employed by the Syrian regime,” Lt. Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie, director of the Joint Staff at the Pentagon, told reporters on Saturday. “Most of these launches occurred after the last impact of our strike was over.”\n",
      "He called the Syrian retaliatory missiles “largely ineffective” and said they “clearly increased risk to their own people based on their indiscriminate response — when you shoot iron into the sky without guidance, it will inevitably fall to earth.”\n",
      "Reporting was contributed by Neil MacFarquhar and Ivan Nechepurenko from Moscow and Helene Cooper and Ron Nixon from Washington.\n",

      "News Analysis\n",
      "WASHINGTON — Lost in the showdown between President Trump and James B. Comey that played out this past week was a chilling threat to the United States. Mr. Comey, the former director of the F.B.I., testified that the Russians had not only intervened in last year’s election, but would try to do it again.\n",
      "What started out as a counterintelligence investigation to guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed into a political scandal about what Mr. Trump did, what he said and what he meant by it. Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the F.B.I. director he fired with cascading requests for documents, recordings and hearings.\n",
      "But from the headquarters of the National Security Agency to state capitals that have discovered that the Russians were inside their voter-registration systems, the worry is that attention will be diverted from figuring out how Russia disrupted American democracy last year and how to prevent it from happening again. Russian hackers did not just breach Democratic email accounts; according to Mr. Comey, they orchestrated a “massive effort” targeting hundreds of — and possibly more than 1,000 — American government and private organizations since 2015.\n",
      "“It’s important for us in the West to understand that we’re facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons to do us harm,” said Daniel Fried, a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year. “Whatever the domestic politics of this, Comey was spot-on right that Russia is coming after us, but not just the U.S., but the free world in general. And we need to take this seriously.”\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s willingness to discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart. As F.B.I. director, he supervised counterintelligence investigations into computer break-ins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House, and that penetrated deep into the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Yet President Barack Obama’s administration did not want to publicize those intrusions, choosing to handle them diplomatically — perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort to manipulate American politics.\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s special agents failed to react aggressively to evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee, spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young information-technology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organization’s emails. Only when emails from Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operation.\n",
      "In October, Mr. Comey declined to sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election — not because he doubted the evidence, aides later said, the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem too political so close to Election Day. Now many members of Mr. Obama’s national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlier.\n",
      "And there is no evidence that the Russians have stopped. The N.S.A. suspects that a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers, which has published tools used by the agency to breach foreign computer networks, is a front for Russia, probably the G.R.U., the military intelligence arm.\n",
      "The Homeland Security Department is also looking at new evidence of computer code buried in the electrical power grid. Russia is believed to be behind two major attacks on Ukraine’s grid, and there are warnings that those techniques could also be turned on the United States.\n",
      "The strategy’s central concept, she said, refined in attacks on Eastern European countries, is that it is “better to collapse a country from within.”\n",
      "Eric S. Edelman, who was an under secretary of defense under President George W. Bush, said Russian information warfare capabilities were highly developed. “In the Cold War, the Soviet efforts in this regard were ham-handed and could be countered with relative ease,” he said. “Today, the Russians are much more sophisticated, and they see things like disinformation, propaganda and what we used to call ‘active measures’ as part of a suite of capabilities.”\n",
      "Graham Allison, a longtime Russia scholar at Harvard, said, “Russia’s cyberintrusion into the recent presidential election signals the beginning of what is almost sure to be an intensified cyberwar in which both they — and we — seek to participate in picking the leaders of an adversary.” The difference, he added, is that American elections are generally fair, so “we are much more vulnerable to such manipulation than is Russia,” where results are often preordained.\n",
      "In Washington, however, the issue has become partisan, because Mr. Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy. He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as “fake news” generated by Democrats to explain their defeat.\n",
      "He repeated that during a news conference on Friday. “That was an excuse by the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldn’t have lost,” he said.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russia’s role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe. Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday, Mr. Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing to protect against future Russian intervention.\n",
      "“There should be no fuzz on this whatsoever,” Mr. Comey said. “The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle. They did it with purpose. They did it with sophistication. They did it with overwhelming technical efforts. And it was an active-measures campaign driven from the top of that government. There is no fuzz on that.”\n",
      "He added, “That’s about as un-fake as you can possibly get and is very, very serious.”\n",
      "“What we didn’t talk enough about was the purpose we were there, about Russia’s involvement and Russia’s intent, how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue to keep trying and hitting on us to change how we do business in America, how we elect our officials, the confidence we have in our government,” Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, said Friday on “Morning Joe” on MSNBC.\n",
      "Similar warnings have been issued by others in the intelligence community, led by James R. Clapper Jr., who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as director of national intelligence. “I don’t think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing,” he said recently.\n",
      "But few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams — they started a scandal that has consumed the American political process.\n",
      "“They can win two ways,” Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Thursday. “They can do it” trying to influence votes, “or they can get caught doing it,” and undercut confidence in the American electoral system.\n",

      "One can understand why Ian Buruma, when he was announced as The Review’s new editor in May, thought: “What the hell have I taken on?” But that only came after a happier intitial reaction. “I thought it was a challenge I would regret not accepting,” Buruma said. “The first feeling was a sense of euphoria, of a changed life.”\n",
      "The Dutch-born Buruma, who officially took the reins of the magazine after Labor Day, is an award-winning journalist and the author of numerous acclaimed books. At 65, he has little experience editing but a lot of familiarity with The Review, to which he’s contributed since 1985.\n",
      "“I felt it was important for someone to know The Review, and Ian certainly had that,” the magazine’s publisher, Rea Hederman, said of hiring Buruma. “He knew Bob almost as long as I did.”\n",
      "A reviewer once called Buruma’s writing “disarmingly reasonable and calm,” and this is precisely how he comes across in person. We spoke on a hot August afternoon in the magazine’s headquarters on Hudson Street in the West Village. Towers of books teetered throughout; but the space was surprisingly airy and light-filled.\n",
      "Buruma sat on a sofa in a communal meeting space looking like someone ready for a laid-back weekend in his polo shirt. The time he spent in the office over the summer getting to know the staff and terrain might have been technically unofficial, but he was busy making assignments, contacting potential new contributors and learning the ways of a place that had only known the leadership of Silvers and Barbara Epstein, the publication’s co-founder and editor who died in 2006.\n",
      "Asked if he wanted to replicate Silvers’s herculean office hours, which he kept until the end of his life, Buruma just laughed. Silvers did the vast majority of direct interacting with writers, virtually lived at the office and dictated emails that read more like lengthy formal letters.\n",
      "“It was a monarchy, and I think perhaps it will be a slightly more democratic operation,” Buruma said. “Certainly I think I’ll be more collaborative. One great strength of The Review at the moment is that it has a number of very, very bright young editors who know more about certain things than I do.”\n",
      "Buruma said he was most daunted by the shift from “thinking of the world as a writer — which is a rather self-centered way of looking at the world. That’s a very different mind-set from finding other people to do things, improving their thinking, helping them.”\n",
      "Hederman said he “didn’t have any trepidation at all” about Buruma’s relative lack of editing experience. “As a writer, Ian was thoughtful about editing. He paid attention to the way his pieces were edited by Bob and others. He had strong feelings about the kind of editing he liked and didn’t like.”\n",
      "Hederman said Silvers thought of Buruma as a possible editor of The Review, but Hederman and others also said that Silvers never expressed strong opinions about what should happen after his tenure. Silvers, like many who observed him, seemed to believe he would be in his perch forever.\n",
      "Buruma intends to feature a more unpredictable ideological roster, given the unprecedented nature of the country’s political climate.\n",
      "“We’re not living in the same time as Nixon or Clinton or Bush,” he said. “Under Trump, the distinctions that used to exist, roughly speaking, between left and right, have become much more fluid. People who may never have come within a mile of the pages of The Review 20 years ago might have a place in it now. Everything will be looked at with fresh eyes.”\n",
      "“It’s kind of like being put in charge of the Parthenon,” Sam Tanenhaus, the former editor of The New York Times Book Review and a contributor to The New York Review, said. “If you change one little figure on the frieze, it will be seen as earthshaking by the people who watch it so closely every day.”\n",
      "Hederman said: “It will be a different publication, it has to be. Bob was one person, and everything went through Bob.”\n",
      "Some changes are already evident. On Aug. 23, Elizabeth Drew, a longtime contributor to the magazine, wrote on Twitter: “Due to a decision I didn’t make, I’ll not be covering Washington politics for New York Review. You’ll find my work elsewhere.”\n",
      "In response to a request for comment by email, Buruma said only: “We never told Elizabeth Drew no longer to write for the NYRB.”\n",
      "Reached by email, Drew said: “Technically, they are correct that no one asked me to stop writing for them.” But she said unanswered letters and phone calls over the summer, and other signs from editors at The Review, made it clear to her that her reporting from Washington was no longer wanted. “I believe that an editor has a right to change writers; the wisdom of his decisions will be for others to judge,” she said.\n",
      "The blog is part of an increasingly robust online operation at The Review, though the magazine remains more firmly anchored to its print product than many of its peers. Surprisingly, the magazine didn’t see the significant increase in subscribers after the 2016 presidential election that other left-leaning publications did. But about 130,000 print subscriptions are part of a total circulation of about 150,000, which has remained steady in recent years.\n",
      "Buruma said he was enthusiastic about helping to continue strengthen the magazine’s online offerings. He will also institute changes in the subjects covered, however gradually. “I share many of Bob’s interests, but not all of them,” he said. “One area I think we could do more in is contemporary art, for example. I also think foreign literature could be featured more.” He hopes to publish more pieces about areas he considers neglected, including Latin America and Southeast Asia.\n",
      "Despite potential additions in those areas, Buruma provides a clear line of continuity for The Review. He is also a white man in his mid-60s at a time when the left is especially sensitive to issues of diversity in the media and elsewhere.\n",
      "“We would like to be as diverse as we possibly can, but the main thing is to maintain the quality of the publication,” Hederman said. “We think we can do that and be diverse at the same time.”\n",
      "Buruma stressed the importance of featuring writers from various backgrounds, but said he also wanted to be careful not to typecast writers by always assigning them to cover authors and subjects based on factors like shared ethnicity or gender.\n",
      "More broadly speaking, the naming of a new editor for the first time in the magazine’s history is a chance for fresh recruiting.\n",
      "“I think the worst thing you can do as a middle-aged editor is to try and second-guess what young people would like to read, what interests them, and then go off in some awkward way like the minister in a church who whips out a guitar and starts singing folk songs,” Buruma said. “I think the way to do it is to find young writers, and then you’ll automatically move to things that they’re interested in, and that’s one of the ways of rejuvenating the publication.”\n",

      "It also shined a bright light on something more commonplace: the F.B.I.’s practice of keeping careful, contemporaneous notes.\n",
      "For law enforcement officials like Mr. Comey, who was fired last week as the director of the F.B.I., documenting sensitive conversations is a reflex — and in keeping with the habits of diligent lawyers. Mr. Comey was a federal prosecutor and corporate counsel before he took over the F.B.I.\n",
      "In sensitive investigations as well as in routine matters, it is standard for people who work in law enforcement to keep detailed phone and meeting logs, Lauren C. Anderson, a former top F.B.I. official, said.\n",
      "“That’s the culture of the F.B.I. — you habitually document everything you do,” Ms. Anderson, a 29-year veteran of the bureau, said. “As a rule, you’re not taping every conversation, so your ability to recall details in a way that can be maintained and relied on is absolutely critical.”\n",
      "The instinct to preserve possible evidence goes beyond the F.B.I.\n",
      "“The same is true in the C.I.A.,” Ms. Anderson said. “They’re meticulous in their documentation of both formal and informal communications.”\n",
      "Memos such as Mr. Comey’s help reflect a level of detail documented while events are still fresh in the writer’s mind. In court, they can serve to corroborate testimony.\n",
      "Interactions with people who may in some way figure into an investigation — regardless of what may be discussed — could be pertinent to an inquiry and later serve as evidence.\n",
      "“Memos give you the flexibility to report facts as well as atmospheric impressions,” Ms. Anderson said.\n",
      "“It goes to his credibility,” she said of Mr. Comey. “The fact that he wrote it when it happened lends weight to it. It’s not like he wrote something last weekend and backdated it.”\n",
      "Mr. Comey’s memos were not the standard forms that F.B.I. agents use to summarize the facts of interviews they conduct, called FD-302s, or 302s in bureau parlance. They were a more informal way to document not just the facts of an interaction but also personal impressions and analysis to help put those facts into context.\n",
      "In 2007, the typewritten notes of Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director at that time, helped resolve a dispute over the Bush administration’s warrantless surveillance program.\n",
      "Mr. Comey, as it happens, was also involved. He testified in 2007 before a congressional committee about a series of meetings and phone conversations about the surveillance program he had in 2004, when he was deputy attorney general.\n",
      "Democrats have used Mr. Comey’s memo to push again for an independent panel to investigate ties between Mr. Trump’s associates and Russia, and some even pressed for the impeachment of Mr. Trump, though many expressed caution on calling for such a drastic step.\n",
      "Many legal questions need to be answered first, said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, including establishing Mr. Trump’s intent if he did ask Mr. Comey to end the inquiry into Mr. Flynn (which the White House denies).\n",
      "“It cannot serve as a method to nullify the election by other means,” Mr. Schiff said of possible impeachment proceedings.\n",
      "Representative Justin Amash, a Michigan Republican with a history of speaking out against his party, said that if Mr. Comey’s account was accurate, he believed it to be grounds for impeachment.\n",
      "The Senate Intelligence Committee and House Oversight Committee separately requested documents related to Mr. Comey’s interactions with the president; leaders of both committees also said they were poised to issue subpoenas to obtain Mr. Comey’s memo if necessary. The Senate committee also invited Mr. Comey to testify openly and behind closed doors.\n",
      "The White House has expressed skepticism of Mr. Comey’s characterization of his interactions with Mr. Trump, insisting that the president never asked that the Flynn investigation be shut down.\n",
      "“The president is confident in the events that he has maintained, and he wants the truth in these investigations to get to the bottom of the situation,” Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said Wednesday. “There are two investigations going on in the House and Senate, and he wants to get to the bottom of this.”\n",

      "Meanwhile, in New York, as the news rippled through the Times building, Mr. Bodkin made his way back to the newsroom and tore another sheet of green paper from his pad. It was time to redesign the front page.\n",
      "The original plan was to feature a large portrait of Comey — a “conventional treatment,” Mr. Bodkin said. “And we had a pretty nice portrait of him, too.”\n",
      "“But then I glanced over to Renee Murawski’s machine” — Ms. Murawski is the content editor for print — “and she showed me the actual letter from the president, which I hadn’t seen yet.”\n",
      "The letter was extraordinary, he thought, not least of all because of the second paragraph, which betrayed Mr. Trump’s concern over the F.B.I.’s inquiries into Russia.\n",
      "“I realized that including the letter itself was a much better solution than simply showing a photograph of Comey. It helped tell the story in a way that was much more explicit.”\n",
      "And Mr. Bodkin’s distinctive treatment earned high praise from readers, many of whom took to Twitter to post photos of the page. (One such tweet, posted by James Corden, the host of “The Late Late Show,” earned several hundred retweets.)\n",
      "As for the tradition of drawing the page by hand, on green paper? That probably dates to the days of Allan M. Siegal, a former assistant managing editor who is much revered in the newsroom.\n",

      "The president railed against Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, for recusing himself in the Russia investigation, and he blasted the F.B.I. for failing to investigate Hillary Clinton, “where there are crimes.” He also lashed out at Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing the Russia investigation.\n",
      "Mr. Trump delivered the emotional tirade hours after federal officials raided Mr. Cohen’s office and hotel room, seizing business records, emails and documents, including information related to a payment that Mr. Cohen made to a pornographic film actress.\n",
      "The raids were in part the result of a referral to federal officials by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Trump called Mr. Mueller’s team “the most biased group of people” and said that it contained mostly Democrats and some Republicans who worked for President Barack Obama.\n",
      "“That is really now in a whole new level of unfairness,” Mr. Trump said of the raids involving Mr. Cohen. Officials said the White House learned about the raids from Mr. Cohen’s lawyer after they were carried out but before they became public knowledge.\n",
      "But the aggressive move by federal officials against Mr. Cohen, the president’s longtime personal lawyer, appeared to strike a particularly sensitive nerve. Mr. Cohen, who works for Mr. Trump’s private company, has long been considered one of the president’s closest business confidants.\n",
      "Mr. Trump reacted to the raids without any prompting from reporters, who had been brought into the Cabinet Room where the president was meeting with Jim Mattis, the secretary of defense; John R. Bolton, the new national security adviser; and other military officials to discuss the situation in Syria. As the cameras began rolling, Mr. Trump immediately condemned the actions against Mr. Cohen.\n",
      "“So, I just heard that they broke into the office of one of my personal attorneys, a good man, and it’s a disgraceful situation,” he said. “It’s a total witch hunt. I’ve been saying it for a long time. I’ve wanted to keep it down.”\n",
      "It was unclear what Mr. Trump meant by saying he “wanted to keep it down.” He went on to criticize Mr. Mueller’s team for examining the president’s associates.\n",
      "“They only keep looking at us. So they find no collusion, and then they go from there and they say, ‘Well, let’s keep going,’ and they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning, and I think it’s a disgrace,” Mr. Trump said.\n",
      "He criticized Mr. Rosenstein for having “signed a FISA warrant,” apparently a reference to the role Mr. Rosenstein played in authorizing the wiretap of a Trump associate in the Russia inquiry. Republicans have been highly critical of the warrant, saying the F.B.I. persuaded judges to authorize it on false pretenses.\n",
      "The president’s suggestion that he might fire Mr. Mueller drew swift condemnations from Capitol Hill, where Democrats and Republicans alike have warned that doing so would cross a dangerous political and legal line.\n",
      "“If the president is thinking of using this raid to fire Special Counsel Mueller or otherwise interfere with the chain of command in the Russia probe, we Democrats have one simple message for him: Don’t,” said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader.\n",
      "“Special Counsel Mueller, a Republican, has uncovered a deep and detailed pattern of Russian interference in our elections that has led to indictments and guilty pleas,” Mr. Schumer added. “It has also led to the Trump administration itself leveling sanctions against Russian individuals for meddling in our elections, proof that it’s not a so-called witch hunt.”\n",

      "President Trump’s nominee to be F.B.I. director, Christopher A. Wray, faced tough questions during his Senate hearing, including some from Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.\n",
      "WASHINGTON — Christopher A. Wray, President Trump’s nominee to be F.B.I. director, sought at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday to show lawmakers that he could protect the bureau’s independence and resist pressure from the White House.\n",
      "“I will never allow the F.B.I.’s work to be driven by anything other than the facts, the law and the impartial pursuit of justice. Period,” Mr. Wray told senators.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The hearing was a chance for Mr. Wray, 50, a private lawyer and former top Justice Department prosecutor, to demonstrate that he was the person to lead the nation’s premier law enforcement agency under extraordinary circumstances. Many of the questions from senators centered on how he would deal with Mr. Trump, referring to Mr. Comey’s tense interactions with the president.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, asked what Mr. Wray would do if the president requested that he take any steps that Mr. Wray believed were illegal.\n",
      "“First, I would try to talk him out of it,” Mr. Wray said. “If that failed, I would resign.”\n",
      "He also said he had no doubts about the intelligence community’s assessment that Russia interfered in the election, a conclusion the president has questioned. He pledged that if confirmed, he would read the classified portions of the assessment as soon as he was sworn in.\n",
      "Pressed by Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, on how he would have handled the investigation, Mr. Wray said he would not have held a news conference.\n",
      "Mr. Wray added, “I can’t imagine a situation where, as F.B.I. director, I would be giving a press conference on an uncharged individual, much less talking in detail about it.”\n",

      "Mr. Graham, who has been critical of Russian interference in the election, described the response as a “great answer.”\n",
      "Mr. Wray said he played no role in approving the legal rationale for those interrogations, adding that he did not condone torture.\n",
      "“The F.B.I. is going to play no part in the use of any techniques of that sort,” Mr. Wray said. President Barack Obama barred the use of such interrogation techniques in 2009.\n",
      "Mr. Wray said he had not talked with Mr. Comey in years, but he recounted a now-famous episode when he, along with Mr. Comey and Robert S. Mueller III, now the special counsel investigating the Russian meddling, considered resigning from the Justice Department. In 2004, Mr. Mueller, then the F.B.I. director, and Mr. Comey, who was the deputy attorney general, threatened to quit the Bush administration over a controversial surveillance program. Mr. Wray also offered to join their protest even though he was not read into the highly classified program.\n",

      "Friends and former colleagues describe Mr. Wray as low-key and understated but exceptionally smart and thoughtful. But Mr. Wray warned those listening to the hearing not to underestimate him because they might view him as “boring,” prompting nods among family members sitting behind him.\n",
      "“Anybody who does would be making a very grave mistake,” he said. He added that he would resist any political pressure if confirmed.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — Cecile Richards, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, was poring over a spiral notebook in her bare-bones office here when she was asked about President Trump’s latest attempt to cut a deal on abortion.\n",
      "Days earlier, the Trump White House had floated a trial balloon: If Planned Parenthood would quit performing abortions, it could keep roughly $550 million in annual federal funding.\n",
      "Ms. Richards, 59, a savvy former political organizer (and a daughter of former Gov. Ann Richards, the tough-talking Texas Democrat) scowled, wondering aloud if the proposal was even serious. “That is just not going to happen,” she said flatly. “We would never abandon the women who count on us in exchange for cash.”\n",
      "But while Ms. Richards stands at the forefront of efforts to protect access to abortion, another politically savvy woman, Marjorie Dannenfelser, who helped elect Mr. Trump and is a longtime ally of Vice President Mike Pence, is just as ardently on the other side, pushing hard to prevent Planned Parenthood from getting a single penny from taxpayers.\n",
      "This week, she had reason to celebrate: Mr. Pence cast the tiebreaking vote when the Senate rolled back an Obama administration rule barring states from denying family planning grants to Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers. The bill will now go to Mr. Trump’s desk.\n",
      "Days after their January inaugural, Mr. Pence hosted a cheese-and-crackers reception for movement leaders in his ceremonial office — an event Ms. Dannenfelser described as a homecoming.\n",
      "“Cecile Richards was in the White House all the time during the Obama administration,” she said. “Now it’s our turn.”\n",
      "These are challenging times for Planned Parenthood, the reproductive rights behemoth known to millions of American women as the place to turn for cancer screening, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, birth control — and yes, abortion. A century after its founder, the pioneering sex educator Margaret Sanger, committed the radical act of opening a birth control clinic in Brooklyn — only to have it shut down by the police — Planned Parenthood had expected to mark its centennial with a big gala in May and Hillary Clinton in the White House.\n",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump’s election has given new life to the abortion wars in Washington, and thrust Ms. Richards — and women, many of them poor, across America who rely on Planned Parenthood for basic health care — into a pitched battle with the president. Mr. Trump lost badly in the first round, when the Republican effort to replace the Affordable Care Act fell apart last month on Capitol Hill. The measure would have barred Medicaid dollars, for one year, from going to any family planning center that provides abortions.\n",
      "There is only one group that fits that description: Planned Parenthood.\n",
      "“The goal here is they want to end access to safe and legal abortion in America,” Ms. Richards said, “and the way they do that is by going after Planned Parenthood.”\n",
      "The health measure would have been far more damaging to Planned Parenthood than the one the Senate just passed and in the weeks leading up to the vote, Ms. Richards led a massive effort to defeat it.\n",
      "Planned Parenthood says its supporters made 122,000 phone calls to members of Congress and organized more than 1,000 events around the nation, including rallies, petitions, phone banks and marches, carefully targeted to Republican moderates. On the day of the vote, 75 supporters showed up at the Northern Virginia offices of Representative Barbara Comstock, a Virginia Republican. A half-hour later, she announced that she would oppose the health bill.\n",
      "Ms. Richards also traveled the country visiting clinics, including in Wisconsin, the home state of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan, the chief architect of the health measure. (There are three Planned Parenthood clinics in his district alone.) Hundreds of women, dressed in pink, turned out for a rally in Milwaukee, where Ms. Richards instructed them to deliver a pointed message to the speaker:\n",
      "“You need to let him know that people in Wisconsin deserve the same ability to choose their doctors as he and every member of Congress have.”\n",
      "Abortions are only a small part of Planned Parenthood’s business, and Medicaid does not pay for them. The federal Hyde Amendment bars tax dollars from financing abortions except in cases of incest, rape or when the health of the mother is at risk. But for Planned Parenthood, which receives roughly 43 percent of its $1.3 billion in annual revenue from the federal government, the loss of Medicaid dollars could be crippling. There is no question that clinics would be forced to close as a result.\n",
      "With more than 650 health centers around the country — in every state except North Dakota — Planned Parenthood sees about 2.5 million patients a year, roughly 1.6 million of them through Medicaid, according to Dr. Raegan McDonald-Mosley, its chief medical officer. Screening for sexually transmitted infections is the No. 1 reason patients visit, and birth control is also high on the list.\n",
      "The anti-abortion movement has set its sights on Planned Parenthood for years — at least since 2007, when Mr. Pence, then an Indiana congressman, introduced the first measure to defund the organization. (“We are truly fellow travelers,’’ Ms. Dannenfelser said of the vice president.) His bill went nowhere, but the idea quickly gained traction inside the anti-abortion movement, said Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, which organizes abortion opponents on college campuses.\n",
      "In 2012, Ms. Hawkins said, her group commissioned Kellyanne Conway, the pollster who is now a senior adviser to Mr. Trump, to research abortion opponents’ attitudes toward Planned Parenthood. “We had all these people who said they were pro-life, who didn’t know what Planned Parenthood was, and didn’t know they committed abortions,” she said.\n",
      "Ms. Hawkins set out to change that, and by 2013, her group was touring college campuses, carrying pink banners and 888 pink crosses to represent the number of abortions performed each day by Planned Parenthood. (The number is derived from Planned Parenthood’s annual report; its clinics performed just under 324,000 abortions last year; abortions account for just 3 percent of the medical services the group provides.)\n",
      "Then, in 2015, undercover anti-abortion activists released a series of graphic videos purportedly showing Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal body parts — a move that spurred the Republican leadership in the Senate to push a defunding measure. (Last week, California prosecutors charged two of the undercover activists with 15 felonies, saying that they had invaded the privacy of medical providers while misrepresenting themselves as they sought to buy fetal tissue from Planned Parenthood.)\n",
      "The videos were a turning point, said Senator James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican and a staunch abortion opponent. He said constituents did not want their money going to any group that performs abortions.\n",
      "“There is a firm belief by many, myself included, that would say ending a life is not health care,’’ he said.\n",
      "The bill passed, but was vetoed by President Barack Obama. With Mr. Trump in the White House, “the threat is very real and there’s no one to veto this,” said Anita Dunn, Mr. Obama’s former communications director, whose strategy firm now consults for Planned Parenthood.\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s daughter Ivanka is said to be a strong supporter of the organization, which is one reason the Trump White House may have floated the possible deal. Ms. Richards said no one from the White House approached her directly with the proposal, and there was never any serious debate about whether to accept it.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has his own statements to contend with. During the campaign, he broke with fellow Republicans in sounding supportive of Planned Parenthood.\n",
      "“I would defund it because I’m pro-life,” Mr. Trump said during a debate on CNN in February 2016, “but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.”\n",
      "Ms. Richards is soldiering on. She was asked what her mother, whose lacerating one-liners made her a feminist icon in her day, might say. “I think the main thing she would say is, ‘Quit whining and get back to work. This is not a time to wring your hands.’”\n",

      "We know that resentment is driving much of Donald Trump’s success — resentment of elites, of the political class, of illegal immigrants, of protesters, of the media — and perhaps most particularly of changes in the demographic makeup of the country that Trump and his followers find unwelcome.\n",
      "Part of the explanation for the triumph of resentment is political and economic, but one question has nagged at me. What is the psychological mechanism underpinning this resentment?\n",
      "More to the point:\n",
      "Opposition to the surge of non-European, nonwhite immigration is a bedrock of the Trump campaign, a crucial element of his attack on political correctness and a key component of the loyalty he elicits from noncollege, middle- and lower-income voters opposed to liberalized immigration — voters who believe they have been dispossessed.\n",
      "In an email, Anastasopoulos writes that\n",
      "polls conducted by large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context. Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the “United States” overall rather than, say, Dayton, Ohio, or Wilmington, North Carolina, places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years. This kind of abstract framing tends to push respondents toward giving more “politically correct” answers to standard poll questions about immigration.\n",
      "The result is\n",
      "a significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the public.\n",
      "The refusal of Democrats and the American left to hear — or to grant some legitimacy to — the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature to ascendant minorities and to waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement. In the zero sum world of immigration politics, it has proved impossible so far to convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sides.\n",
      "The quest by American liberals and progressives for support, or at least tolerance, of diversity, inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely to prevail — particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailed.\n",
      "the feeling you get when people try to stop you from doing something you’ve been doing, and you perceive that they have no right or justification for stopping you. So you redouble your efforts and do it even more, just to show that you don’t accept their domination. Men in particular are concerned to show that they do not accept domination.\n",
      "Psychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response to regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and autonomy. This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged to adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior. Specifically, a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state, called psychological reactance, that elicits behaviors intended to restore this autonomy.\n",
      "Haidt applies this to the 2016 election:\n",
      "Translated to the Trump phenomenon, I would say that decades of political correctness, with its focus on “straight white men” as the villains and oppressors — now extended to “straight white cis-gendered men” — has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white men.\n",
      "In both the workplace and academia, Haidt argues,\n",
      "the accusatory and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men to say and do un-PC things.\n",
      "In this atmosphere, according to Haidt,\n",
      "Trump comes along and punches political correctness in the face. Anyone feeling some degree of anti-PC reactance is going to feel a thrill in their heart, and will want to stand up and applaud. And because feelings drive reasoning, these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone to present arguments to them about the downsides of a Trump presidency.\n",
      "Trump’s anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks to the resentment of many American men and their resistance to being instructed, particularly by a female candidate, on how they should think, speak or behave.\n",
      "I have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak. … I am not going to deal with their temper tantrums, or their bullying or their efforts to try to provoke me. He can say whatever he wants to say about me, I could really care less.\n",
      "“I don’t think a nation can be great that turns its back on the poor and the unfortunate.”\n",
      "“We’ve got to do more to raise families’ incomes. We can start by raising the federal minimum wage.”\n",
      "“We’re stronger together. When we embrace immigrants, not denigrate them. When we build bridges, not walls.”\n",
      "Trump has made Clinton his foil of choice.\n",
      "On Dec. 21, 2015, Trump told an audience in Grand Rapids:\n",
      "Even a race with Obama, she was gonna beat Obama. I don’t know who would be worse, I don’t know, how could it be worse? But she was going to beat — she was favored to win — and she got schlonged, she lost, I mean she lost.\n",
      "I really deplore the tone of his campaign, the inflammatory rhetoric that he is using to divide people, and his going after groups of people with hateful, incendiary rhetoric.\n",
      "Nothing really surprises me anymore. I don’t know that he has any boundaries at all. His bigotry, his bluster, his bullying have become his campaign. And he has to keep sort of upping the stakes and going even further.\n",
      "I’m answering him on what I think voters care about. I’m answering him on the differences between our records, our experience, what we want to do for our country, how important it is to try to unify the country.\n",
      "Jesse Graham, a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, suggested that the fact that Clinton is a woman plays a role in this dynamic, noting that many Trump followers respond to Clinton in a fashion similar to that of\n",
      "8th grade boys reacting to their homeroom teacher. But I think this has more to do with her gender than with any particular behaviors on her part — in other words, there are some who would respond to any woman running for president as an 8th grader in homeroom who resents the teacher.\n",
      "Simon Hedlin, a public policy researcher, noted that\n",
      "since reactance is driven by perceptions rather than by facts, this works well in Trump’s favor, considering his often cavalier relationship with the truth.\n",
      "In other words, reactance can foster a totalizing loyalty that does not respond to reasoned fault finding. This might help explain Trump’s seeming immunity to criticism from his adversaries. His followers feel that they have experienced a “diminution of freedom” and believe that Trump can “restore their autonomy.”\n",
      "He has won a unique admixture of support, based in part on what might be called an anti-rational or irrational loyalty but also in part on his recognition of legitimate grievances among his adherents that many other politicians belittle or deny. This loyalty, as Republican candidates found during the primaries, is far wider and deeper than anyone not sharing it expected.\n",
      "Clinton remains the favorite, but she faces five months of treading water in a shark tank. She has yet to discover a compelling rebuttal to Trump on political correctness, and it will be difficult for her to placate opponents of immigration while holding her advantage with her base. Nonetheless, although her bite is not as lethal as Trump’s, she will soon have almost the entire Democratic Party in her corner, including a cadre of operatives whose specialty is drawing blood.\n",

      "Now Democrats are embracing Mr. Comey, a man many of them blame for Mr. Trump’s election, as a star witness in the investigation into Russian election meddling and potentially problematic behavior by the president.\n",
      "“I have long disagreed with Comey about surveillance, about encryption, about secret legal interpretations,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat and Intelligence Committee veteran. “But I continue to believe the timing of the decision to fire James Comey just stinks.”\n",
      "Democrats do not intend to dwell on the awkward past at Thursday’s hearing, which is conjuring a level of anticipation associated only with that most riveting of Washington set pieces: a televised congressional hearing reaching into the Oval Office. Instead, they say they simply want to determine whether Mr. Trump took steps to thwart Mr. Comey in overseeing an investigation into any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia related to the election.\n",
      "“I just want to know whether this administration or this president ever tried to interfere with him doing his job,” said Senator Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat and member of the Intelligence Committee. “I didn’t always agree with his judgment, but that is different from trying to interfere with his day-to-day operations at the F.B.I.”\n",
      "Democrats have not always been so restrained in their assessment of Mr. Comey. Many were apoplectic over his announcement — just days before November’s election — that he had resumed a federal inquiry into whether Mrs. Clinton mishandled classified information through her use of a private email server as secretary of state. Some Democrats were already fed up with Mr. Comey after he announced in July that he would not recommend charges against Mrs. Clinton while delivering a stinging critique of her conduct. Lawmakers and many in the Justice Department concluded Mr. Comey had acted outside his authority.\n",
      "Harry Reid, then the Senate Democratic leader, suggested Mr. Comey had broken the law, and Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, then the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, spoke for many of her colleagues when she called his actions shocking and appalling. Others were even more strident.\n",
      "The difference in tone was not lost on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, in response to Democratic outrage at the firing of Mr. Comey in early May.\n",
      "“So what we have now,” Mr. McConnell said at the time, “is our Democratic colleagues complaining about the removal of an F.B.I. director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply criticized.”\n",
      "Democrats say that despite their reservations about Mr. Comey, they see him as a dedicated public servant who performed in a variety of difficult roles and deserved better than his treatment by Mr. Trump.\n",
      "Those who have assailed Mr. Comey in the past say it is perfectly legitimate to now defend his efforts to get to the bottom of the president’s actions.\n",
      "“It is possible to both think that what Comey did last year is really terrible and that he shouldn’t be fired for conducting an investigation into the president’s campaign,” said Matthew Miller, a former Justice Department spokesman who has been sharply critical of Mr. Comey.\n",
      "“Washington always oversimplifies everything,” he said. “Comey’s good or Comey’s bad. But the reality is more complex. I think what he did last year was a firing offense, but that doesn’t mean the president can fire him for something different when doing it is potentially obstruction of justice.”\n",
      "“If there is a loose string, I will try to pull on it,” Mr. Heinrich said. “What we are talking about is whether or not the Russians were manipulating our election cycle and what role the president may or may not have had with interfering with this investigation.”\n",
      "“This,” Mr. Wyden said, “is an opportunity to get on the record what the status of the investigation was at the time of his firing. The president would do well to remember that in America, the truth always comes out.”\n",
      "Democrats have a complicated history with Mr. Comey. But in this case, their connection is as simple as this old saying: The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\n",

      "The declaration from Mr. Spencer, in an interview late Saturday, was typical of the man who has rhetorically elbowed his way into the national conversation with his use of Nazi language and his unalloyed contention that America belongs to white people.\n",

      "Yet it is by no means clear what the demonstrations mean for the future of this movement and what, if any, lasting effect they will have.

      "Some left-leaning Charlottesville organizers like Laura Goldblatt, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Virginia, said that the full airing of such ideas would eventually lead more Americans to reject them. “I think this is the beginning of the end for this spectacularized part of the movement,” Ms. Goldblatt said.\n",
      "But some key far-right leaders say the outcome was exactly what they had hoped for.\n",
      "“We achieved all of our objectives,” Matthew Heimbach, a founder of the Nationalist Front, a neo-Nazi group that bills itself as an umbrella organization for the white nationalist movement, said in an interview Saturday. “We showed that our movement is not just online, but growing physically. We asserted ourselves as the voice of white America. We had zero vehicles damaged, all our people accounted for, and moved a large amount of men and materials in and out of the area. I think we did an incredibly impressive job.”\n",
      "Jason Kessler, a Charlottesville conservative and the main organizer of Saturday’s rally, has been fighting for months against the City Council’s plan to remove a statue of the Confederate general Robert E. Lee from Charlottesville’s Emancipation Park, which once bore Lee’s name.\n",
      "Although he is a relative newcomer to the white nationalist movement, Mr. Kessler is well known in his hometown. He has attacked the city’s status as a sanctuary for immigrants and has waged a public battle against Wes Bellamy, the black vice-mayor of Charlottesville and one of its city councilmen.\n",
      "“It was all these different affinity groups that came together in the same place even if they didn’t know each other before,” Mr. Moore said. “It’s been a real summer of hate here.”\n",
      "Heidi Beirich, who runs the intelligence project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors far-right groups, was among those who watched with alarm as the online excitement over the gathering grew. “It was astounding to see it go from 100 people saying they were going to go, to 300, to 500, to 700, to raising money on online platforms to facilitate that,” she said.\n",
      "Over the weekend, far-right groups poured into town, representing long-established racist organizations and the newer alt-right movement. It was not the first time these two strains had met up for a rally in recent months — members of both had appeared at a pro-Confederacy rally in New Orleans in May — but it was the latest example of a new bridging of two generations of hard-right sensibilities.\n",
      "George Hawley, a University of Alabama political science professor who studies white supremacists, said that many of the far-right members he had interviewed did not inherit their racism from their parents, but developed it online. Many of them had never heard of, say, David Duke, the former Louisiana politician and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.\n",
      "But this weekend, Mr. Duke arrived in Charlottesville, along with an array of old-school and new-school white supremacists. They included organizations like Vanguard America, whose Nazi-era motto “Blood and Soil” was chanted by the marchers on Friday night, and the Rise Above Movement, a loose collective of California neo-Nazis, formerly known as the DIY Division, who train to fight at political events. Members of the League of the South showed up, as did their more recently radicalized colleagues from Identity Evropa, a white separatist group that endorses racial segregation.\n",
      "On Friday night, hundreds of far-right sympathizers bearing torches marched across the University of Virginia campus, chanting “You will not replace us,” and “Jews will not replace us.” There was a brawl with counterprotesters, and at least one arrest.\n",
      "Mr. Kessler said that the movement’s torch-lit rally Friday night was especially successful. “It was a beautiful moment that no one will ever be able to take away from people who were involved.”\n",
      "The next morning, the trouble started early. Mr. Spencer recalled driving to Emancipation Park with Mr. Kessler. They arrived around 10:15 a.m., and were almost instantly met with dissent.\n",
      "“As we were going in, I was sprayed with Mace,” Mr. Spencer said. “Someone jumped out of the crowd and I got it in the face.”\n",
      "The counterprotesters included members of the local Charlottesville clergy and mainstream figures like the Harvard professor Cornel West. As the rally erupted into violence Saturday morning, the First United Methodist Church on East Jefferson Street opened its doors to demonstrators, serving cold water and offering basic medical care.\n",
      "Dr. Hawley said he believed the far-left activists, known as antifa, were welcomed by the white nationalists. “I think to an extent the alt-right loves the antifa because they see them as being the perfect foil,” he said.\n",
      "But Ms. Goldblatt, while not addressing those leftists who resorted to violence, said that some kind of response in the street was necessary. History, she said, has shown that “ignoring white supremacy, in terms of shutting your doors and not coming out to confront them, has been a really dangerous strategy.”\n",
      "The scenes of violence were already dominating cable television news by 1:42 p.m., when a gray Dodge Challenger sped down a narrow street choked with counterprotesters. The driver, identified by the police as James Alex Fields Jr., had been seen at the protests alongside members of a right-wing group. He was charged with second-degree murder.\n",
      "The organizers of the event distanced themselves from the crash and Mr. Kessler disavowed any knowledge of Mr. Fields. “I don’t know anyone who knew,” Mr. Kessler said. “Everyone in my circles was like, ‘Who is this guy?’”\n",
      "“This is a very different dynamic than I’m used to,” Mr. Spencer said. “I thought that political violence had just become impossible, that we’d never see it again.”\n",
      "Mr. Kessler was scheduled to address the news media Sunday. When he appeared, he was shouted down by protesters, and someone punched him.\n",
      "After widespread criticism of Mr. Trump’s remarks, an anonymous White House spokesperson on Sunday said in a statement that the president “condemns all forms of violence, bigotry and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, K.K.K. neo-Nazi and all extremist groups.”\n",
      "Preston Wiginton, a white nationalist from Texas, announced this weekend that he would hold a White Lives Matter rally at Texas A&M on Sept. 11 with Mr. Spencer as a guest speaker. And on the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer, a post promised: “There will be more events. Soon. We are going to start doing this nonstop. Across the country.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Trump made his first “Crooked Hillary” Twitter post less than 48 hours into the new year on Tuesday, accusing a former Clinton aide of “disregarding basic security protocols,” and calling his own Justice Department a “deep state.”\n",
      "Attacking Hillary Clinton, his former Democratic opponent from the 2016 presidential election, and taking aim at his own Justice Department struck familiar tones for the new year. Almost 14 months after the election, Mr. Trump has kept up a regular drumbeat of attacks on Mrs. Clinton. Last year, Mr. Trump also criticized the Justice Department and Attorney General Jeff Sessions for not pursuing investigations of his political opponents.\n",
      "On Friday, the State Department released about 3,000 of Ms. Abedin’s work-related emails. The emails were found on the laptop of Ms. Abedin’s now estranged husband, Anthony D. Weiner, and were released as part of a public records request.\n",

      "Mr. Giuliani declined to confirm whether a meeting took place. But the three people briefed on the sit-down — the first since the former New York City mayor joined the legal team last week — described it as a productive effort to reopen negotiations over a possible interview that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is seeking with the president.\n",
      "“At this stage of an investigation, it’d be highly unusual to let an ordinary client testify,” Mr. Giuliani said. However, he added, “This isn’t an ordinary client. This is the president of the United States.”\n",
      "He said that they were trying to assess whether Mr. Mueller “and his staff are truly objective,” particularly in terms of Mr. Comey. “Obviously, if they’ve already made up their minds, we’d be stupid to do that.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump’s legal team is not united on precisely how to deal with Mr. Mueller’s office going forward. But a person familiar with the discussions said that they expected to visit with Mr. Mueller’s team in the next few days as they try to find a path forward.\n",
      "Mr. Giuliani’s longtime law partner, Marc L. Mukasey, is likely to join the team after a success this week in a trial in Connecticut, two people close to the team said.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed different views at different times about whether he wants to sit for an interview with Mr. Mueller. But some people on the president’s team believe that the only way to wind down the special counsel investigation is to negotiate an interview, or something in its place, that would satisfy the questions Mr. Mueller has.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has denounced that investigation, and he has maintained that there was “no collusion” between his campaign and Russians seeking to influence the 2016 election. But Mr. Giuliani is a well-known name who was willing to take on Mr. Trump’s case, and he has a personal relationship with Mr. Mueller from his own days working for the Justice Department.\n",
      "Some of Mr. Trump’s lawyers believe that the existing law does not allow for the prosecution of a sitting president, meaning that Mr. Mueller is most likely to simply issue a report to Congress, regardless of whether Mr. Trump takes part in an interview.\n",
