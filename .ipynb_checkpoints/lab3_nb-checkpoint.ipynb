      "The Reader Center is a newsroom initiative that is helping The Times build deeper ties with our audience.\n",
      "We have asked our standards editor, Phil Corbett, to explain our use of honorifics.\n",
      "I’m not sure whether one of my long-ago predecessors got similar complaints about The Times’s references to “Mr. Lincoln.” But I can assure readers that we have been consistent for many years in how we refer to an incumbent president: It’s “President Trump” (or President Obama, or President Bush) on first reference, and “Mr. Trump” or “the president” (lowercase) thereafter.\n",
      "No disrespect is intended.\n",
      "In fact, most news organizations dispense with the “Mr.” altogether and simply call the president “Trump” after the first reference. The Times is among the few outlets still using courtesy titles like “Mr.” or “Ms.” (with exceptions in our sports coverage and a few other areas). Some readers (me included) like the tone of civility and seriousness the titles convey; others find them old-fashioned and stodgy. And still others are just confused.\n",
      "Besides questions about the president, readers have asked about our references to the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, as “Mr. Kelly.” As a retired Marine officer, these readers say, he should be “General Kelly.”\n",
      "In most cases, The Times follows tradition and continues to use the titles General and Admiral for retired military officers. But we make an exception for those who take high-level civilian positions in government — the chief of staff is “Mr. Kelly” after the first reference; the defense secretary, Jim Mattis, also a retired Marine general, is “Mr. Mattis.” (With this, too, we take a bipartisan approach: The retired Army general David Petraeus was “Mr. Petraeus” as C.I.A. director in the Obama administration.)\n",
      "The idea is to avoid confusion and make it clear that the official is serving in a civilian role, not a military one. By contrast, Mr. Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, is still “General McMaster” because he remains on active duty in the Army.\n",
      "Questions also arise about titles for medical doctors. Our style is to use “Dr.” only for those whose medical practice remains their primary occupation. That means doctors-turned-politicians get “Mr.” or “Ms.,” not “Dr.” Here, too, the practice is nonpartisan. Howard Dean, a doctor, former Vermont governor and onetime Democratic candidate for president, is “Mr. Dean” for us, and Senator Rand Paul, a Republican and ophthalmologist, is “Mr. Paul.”\n",

      "WASHINGTON — A federal law that effectively bans commercial sports gambling across most of the nation faced skepticism at the Supreme Court on Monday. A majority of the justices indicated that the law had crossed a constitutional line by requiring states to do the bidding of the federal government.\n",
      "New Jersey is leading the challenge to the law, and Chris Christie, the state’s governor, watched the argument from the front row.\n",
      "Americans are estimated to annually place $150 billion in illegal wagers on sports. If the Supreme Court strikes down the law, dozens of states could quickly make such wagers legal and reap tax revenues from them.\n",
      "The court’s decision, expected by June, could also affect other conflicts between federal and state authorities. At Monday’s argument, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said some forms of federal regulation of marijuana could be threatened by a ruling that allows sports betting.\n",
      "The betting law, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992, prohibited states from authorizing sports gambling. It exempted Nevada, where sports betting has long been legal, along with sports lotteries in Delaware, Montana and Oregon. Other states were given a year to opt in, but none acted in time.\n",
      "In 2011, though, as casinos in Atlantic City were losing revenue, voters in New Jersey amended its state Constitution to allow sports betting, and the state Legislature soon passed a law authorizing it. The four major sports leagues successfully challenged the state law as a violation of the federal one.\n",
      "In 2014, the Legislature tried a new approach, partly repealing its existing bans on sports betting to allow it at racetracks and casinos. The leagues again sued and won.\n",
      "In the Supreme Court, the federal law faced headwinds.\n",
      "“The citizens of the State of New Jersey are bound to obey a law that the state doesn’t want but that the federal government compels the state to have,” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said.\n",
      "He said that crossed a constitutional line and blurred the political accountability of elected officials. “The citizen doesn’t know,” he said. “Is this coming from the federal government? Is this coming from the state government? That’s precisely what federalism is designed to prevent.”\n",
      "The Supreme Court has said that the federal government may not commandeer state resources to achieve federal objectives. On the other hand, the court has said that the federal government may regulate all sorts of things directly and that federal laws pre-empt contrary state laws under the Constitution’s supremacy clause.\n",
      "Most of Monday’s argument in Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, No. 16-476, was an effort to decide whether the 1992 law amounted to unconstitutional commandeering or permissible pre-emption.\n",
      "Theodore B. Olson, a lawyer for New Jersey, said the law was a “direct command” to the states rather than a federal effort to regulate sports betting.\n",
      "Justice Stephen G. Breyer proposed a distinction. The federal government can first make a policy determination to regulate an activity, he said. “Once it makes that determination, it can forbid state laws inconsistent with that determination,” he said. “That’s called pre-emption.” What it cannot do, he added, “is to tell the state how to legislate.”\n",
      "Mr. Olson agreed. “I wish I had said that myself, Justice Breyer,” he said.\n",
      "Justice Elena Kagan did not seem fully persuaded, asking whether state officials were required to do anything in particular by the 1992 law. “Who is being conscripted in order to do what here?” she asked.\n",
      "Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the sports leagues and Mr. Olson’s successor as solicitor general in the George W. Bush administration, said the 1992 law was part of a set of regulations establishing federal policy. “Congress in all of these statutes did not want there to be sports gambling schemes operating in interstate commerce,” he said.\n",
      "Jeffrey B. Wall, a deputy solicitor general who argued in support of the leagues, said New Jersey was not entitled to repeal only a part of its law, thereby “channeling sports gambling to particular state-preferred providers.” He added that the federal government would not object to a wholesale repeal of the state law.\n",
      "“The problem that Congress was confronting was state sponsored and sanctioned sports gambling schemes,” Mr. Wall said. “It didn’t care if I bet with my buddy on the Redskins game or we had an office pool. It wasn’t going after all sports gambling.”\n",
      "For most of the argument, the lawyers and the justices ignored the potential consequences of a decision striking down the law. Toward the end, though, Mr. Olson noted that billions of dollars were at stake.\n",
      "“Nevada has sports betting, and it has it regulated,” he said. “What I’m saying is, and all of the evidence supports this, that betting on sports is taking place all over the United States. Five percent of it is legal in Nevada. The rest of it is illegal. New Jersey decided we are going to look at it.”\n",

      "Amazon will probably narrow the list to a group of finalists before conducting site visits and meeting with elected officials and community leaders. It has said it expects to reach a decision next year.\n",
      "Still, Amazon’s stated objectives and past behavior — along with interviews with people working with the company on the selection process (none of whom were willing to be named because of their Amazon ties) and corporate governance and location experts — yield some insights into what factors the retailer values most highly and where the new headquarters may end up. (An Amazon spokesman declined to comment.)\n",
      "This means far more than an attractive building or campus. Amazon prides itself on having its existing headquarters embedded in the urban fabric of Seattle. Just this month, the company said it would take over the top six floors of the Macy’s department store downtown — a move rich in irony, given how Macy’s has struggled in competing with online retailers — and it will occupy all of the office space at the Rainier Square development that is planned for the city’s downtown area.\n",
      "The idea of inhabiting the sort of self-contained suburban corporate parks so common in Silicon Valley seems anathema to Amazon. The company has said that 20 percent of its employees in Seattle don’t use motorized transport to get to work. Fifty-five percent walk, ride bikes or use public transportation. Fifteen percent live in the ZIP code where they work.\n",
      "Amazon deliberately provides cafeteria space for only a third of its employees, which encourages people to venture out of the office. The company provides retail space on the ground floor of its Seattle buildings and tries not to rent to generic national chains (its headquarters has a dozen local coffee roasters.) It has developed a sense of the kind of urban community that attracts and retains highly educated, talented and creative workers.\n",
      "In practical terms, this kind of dense, vibrant and architecturally distinctive urban environment exists mostly in cities that developed before the advent of the automobile, industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast and older cities in Canada.\n",
      "Cities like Pittsburgh, Detroit and Baltimore are rich in underutilized historic buildings and neighborhoods that could be imaginatively repurposed, offering Amazon the opportunity to be a transformative force, something that seems to be part of the company’s DNA.\n",
      "Cyril Bouquet, a professor at IMD, an international business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, and an expert in companies with dual headquarters, said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic message.\n",
      "“Amazon has the opportunity to help build and shape a city and region,” he said. “That’s easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco. It’s much different than just tapping the talent that’s already there. Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired by that.”\n",
      "Next on Amazon’s wish list are capital and operating costs” and “incentives,” which Amazon identifies as “high priority” considerations. That is as it should be, said Charles M. Elson, a professor and director of the John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. “Amazon’s first obligation is to its investors,” Professor Elson said, which means finding “the most cost-effective city in which to locate a second headquarters,” one that “will produce the most value for the company.”\n",
      "Most contenders have been secretive about their bids, but the incentives will probably be substantial. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers, for instance, have offered a $7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark. Any city that really wants Amazon will have to ante up, and most will find the wherewithal to do so.\n",
      "New York City, with a score of 104.7, and San Francisco (104.5) are two of the most expensive cities in the country, making them long shots. (Seattle, at 100.8, is just above the baseline.) Boston, at 101.2, would probably barely make the cut. Washington’s score is 99.4.\n",
      "The lowest-cost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt; Austin’s score is 96.2. But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages: Cincinnati (94), Baltimore (96.5), Pittsburgh (97), Chicago (98.3) and Philadelphia (99.8) are all below the baseline. Thanks to the strong dollar (which could change over time), Canadian cities fare especially well: Montreal’s score is 85.2; Toronto’s is 85.6. Both cities also have vibrant urban cores and have emphasized Canada’s talent-friendly immigration policies.\n",
      "“Labor Force” is third on Amazon’s list. The company appears to be bumping up against the limits of Seattle’s talent pool.\n",
      "The top cities on that list are San Francisco and the Bay Area, Seattle and New York — no surprises there. But other cities also fare well: Washington is No. 4, Toronto is No. 6, Boston is No. 9 and Baltimore is No. 11.\n",
      "Conversely, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Milwaukee and St. Louis all rank so low it is hard to see them as viable contenders.\n",
      "Detroit, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle, but could still be competitive. Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability to attract the talent it wants. Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon, Microsoft and then a host of once-fledgling technology firms set up operations there. Amazon expects its arrival in a new city to have a similar impact.\n",
      "Amazon adds that “a strong university system is required.”\n",
      "Many contending cities offer first-rate universities, including highly ranked programs in technology. Boston is a standout, with Harvard, M.I.T., Boston College, Boston University, but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toronto has the University of Toronto and York University.\n",
      "Amazon cites logistics as “critically important,” specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights to Seattle, Washington, New York and San Francisco. (These cities are likely to have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquarters.)\n",
      "In addition to major airports, Boston, Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtrak’s northeast rail corridor, with easy rail access to New York and Washington.\n",
      "“Community cultural fit” and “community quality of life” are last on Amazon’s list of preferences. Along with the usual amenities, Amazon specifically mentions “a diverse population” and, again, “excellent institutions of higher education.” If weather and independent coffee roasters are important, Austin would be a good fit.\n",
      "Most major cities offer an array of cultural, culinary, recreational and sports attractions, and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrives.\n",
      "That puts a premium on diversity and education, factors important in attracting a talented work force. Given Amazon’s vocal support for diversity and inclusion, it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as intolerant or that has moved to curb civil rights, like North Carolina’s widely publicized effort to curb gay and transgender rights.\n",
      "There are obviously many variables still to be assessed, but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon to place on them, here are my finalists, in descending order: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Toronto, Chicago and Boston.\n",

In that series, the Capitals forward Joel Ward, who now plays for the San Jose Sharks, scored the Game 7 overtime goal that eliminated the Bruins from the playoffs. The goal unleashed a torrent of racist social media posts aimed at Ward, who is black, from so-called Bruins fans. I had thought that we were beyond that in hockey, but I was wrong. So I decided to start the blog to help educate people — white and minority — that folks of color have a hockey history and a place in the game. I like to say that The Color of Hockey is about the history and growing impact of people of color in the game.\n",

      "I’m a goaltender who still plays about once a week, or as my work/family schedule allows. I started playing when I was 12 or 13 years old, growing up in Philadelphia. I was home sick watching T.V. and came across the 1972 Summit Series between Team Canada and the Soviet Union. I liked what I saw, but I really didn’t know what hockey was. So I looked it up in the encyclopedia. When I got well, I saved my allowance and bought a pair of skates. After I got proficient on blades, I saved more and bought goalie equipment. I taught myself to play the position, watching N.H.L. goalies on T.V. and reading Jacques Plante’s book on goaltending. I joined a bantam hockey team out of West Philadelphia that played at the University of Pennsylvania’s Class of 1923 rink. I progressed and played one season of Junior B-level hockey for a team that was called Red Lion and belonged to a league called the Junior Mid-Atlantic League. We weren’t very good as a team, but I learned a lot about goaltending because I saw a ton of shots.\n",

      "That’s an interesting question. My 19-year-old twin daughters ask me when I sleep. I tell them “I don’t know.” I blog as time allows — at least once a week, usually writing posts on the weekend while watching hockey on T.V. And sometimes my political work and hockey merge. I occasionally play pickup hockey with Capitol Hill staffers and lobbyists. I used to play morning pickup with a group that included the then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts.\n",

      "I think the face of hockey is changing for several reasons. In many ways it reflects the changing of North America through the growth of minority populations and immigration. Karl Subban, the father of the Nashville Predators defenseman P.K. Subban, likes to tell the story about how he moved with his family from Jamaica to Sudbury, Ontario, as a boy and how hockey helped him assimilate into the Canadian fabric. I think increased affluence also has something to do with it. Minority families are moving out of cities and into suburbs and their kids are playing what their new friends are playing. It may be hockey, or soccer, or lacrosse. As for urban kids whose families who can’t afford hockey, there are a growing number of programs that provide equipment, ice time and instruction at little or no costs. These include programs like Philadelphia’s Ed Snider Youth Hockey Foundation, New York’s Ice Hockey in Harlem and Washington’s Fort Dupont Ice Hockey Club. Fort Dupont is the oldest minority-oriented youth hockey program in the United States.\n",
      "Greenway is huge — 6-foot-5, 230 pounds — at 20 years old. He’s a dangerous combination of size, speed and finesse. He earned his way onto the U.S. roster from his performance at the 2017 International Ice Hockey Federation World Junior Championship that was played in Montreal and Toronto. Greenway was consistently one of the best players on the ice. A man among boys is a sports cliché, but with his size and scoring hands, he was indeed a man among boys. He should be in the N.H.L. sometime after he finishes at Boston University. He’s a 2015 second-round draft pick of the Minnesota Wild. He has a younger brother, defenseman J.D. Greenway, who plays for the University of Wisconsin (coached by the U.S. Olympic hockey coach Tony Granato) and was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the third round of the 2016 N.H.L. Draft.\n",
      "As a fan, I have mixed feelings about the N.H.L. not being in Pyeongchang. It feels odd not having the best players in the world here. At the same time, the lack of N.H.L. starpower makes the men’s Olympic hockey tournament a wild card that could be full of surprises.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — President Trump began his first Thanksgiving vacation in office with an early-morning Twitter rage in which he again vented about some of his favorite targets: sports figures he thinks have defied him.\n",
      "Together, the posts were a reprise of Mr. Trump’s personal attacks against sports figures — many of them African-American — for what he judges to be poor behavior on their part and a failure to demonstrate enough deference to others.\n",
      "White House officials deny that the president is focused on race when he comments about sports and athletes. But to historians and black activists, the tweets are clear evidence of an attempt by the president to send a message of solidarity to many supporters.\n",
      "“President Trump appears to have a peculiar overfascination with African-American athletes and a negative fascination,” said Douglas A. Blackmon, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book “Slavery By Another Name” and the host of “American Forum,” a weekly show produced by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center.\n",
      "Twitter has long been the president’s preferred method for directing his outrage at individuals, and those of all races have been his targets, including Hillary Clinton; James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director; and Khizr Khan, the Pakistani father of a fallen American soldier.\n",
      "But Mary Frances Berry, who is African-American and who served as the chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights, said that Mr. Trump’s particular desire during his first year in office to lash out at African-American sports figures was hard to ignore.\n",
      "“It just reinforces a theme that’s already on their mind,” Ms. Berry, now a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, said of the president’s tweets. “It’s tailor-made for him to spout off and reinforce his base.”\n",
      "Speaking to an adoring, and mostly white, crowd in Huntsville, Ala., in September, Mr. Trump referenced the actions of football players like Mr. Kaepernick who knelt during the national anthem and said he would love to see an N.F.L. owner say, “Get that son of a bitch off the field right now.”\n",
      "Mr. Ball stoked the confrontation with the president this week, refusing on CNN to thank Mr. Trump for his assistance and saying that “I don’t have to say, to go around saying thank you to everybody.”\n",
      "That interview appears to have prompted the angry response from Mr. Trump. He insisted that he was the one who rescued Mr. Ball’s son, and he chided Mr. Ball for refusing to give Mr. Trump the due he felt he deserved.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly denied that his criticism of kneeling is aimed at African-American players. “The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race,” he tweeted in September. And White House officials have said the president’s tweets are about patriotism.\n",
      "“This isn’t an us-versus them. This should be something that brings our country together,” Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, told reporters in the days after Mr. Trump first raised the issue. “All Americans should be proud to stand up, salute that flag, salute that anthem and be part of that process.”\n",
      "Polls suggest that many agree with Mr. Trump. One taken in September found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with the president that it was wrong for football players to kneel during the national anthem to express a political opinion, compared with 43 percent who said they were right to do so.\n",
      "In some ways, Mr. Ball and Mr. Trump are made for each other: two publicity-seeking individuals who rarely shy away from a good verbal fight.\n",
      "It was the success of Mr. Ball’s eldest son, Lonzo, as U.C.L.A.’s freshman point guard last season that gave Mr. Ball a platform to build a brand. Since then, he has often let loose a series of attention-grabbing statements, including once claiming that — in his prime — he could have beaten Michael Jordan one-on-one.\n",
      "But some of Mr. Trump’s critics say the president’s attack on Mr. Ball was about more than just chest-thumping between the two men. They say it echoes what they view as an obsession by Mr. Trump on sports figures who are black.\n",
      "Harry Edwards, a civil rights activist and professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, said that Mr. Trump understood that attacking black athletes — who are among the most popular figures in African-American communities — sent a powerful signal to some of his most fervent voters.\n",
      "“All of these attacks resonate with a base that have some severe perspectives on African-American equality and justice,” he said. “To attack African-American athletes is really a way of sending that message that these are others.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump has excoriated the N.F.L. for allowing players to kneel, which he sees as disrespecting the American flag. In his tweet on Wednesday, the president criticized Roger Goodell, the longtime leader of the football league, asking “when will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league!”\n",
      "Mr. Blackmon said Mr. Trump’s focus on the actions of the players suggested that he took a particular affront when his expectations of their behavior was not met.\n",
      "“This consistent pattern — African-Americans who stand up in a sense to him, who do not seem to be sufficiently compliant — seem to draw particular ire,” Mr. Blackmon said.\n",

      "Vrana made the most of his promotion to the top line alongside Alex Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov, setting up the tying goal and scoring the Game 5 winner as Washington beat the Pittsburgh Penguins 6-3 Saturday night to take a 3-2 lead in the second-round series and put the back-to-back defending Stanley Cup champions on the brink of elimination.\n",
      "After replacing an ineffective Devante Smith-Pelly on the top line, the 22-year-old rookie sprung Kuznetsov on the breakaway that tied the score early in the third period and took a pass from Ovechkin and scored the go-ahead goal with 4:38 left to send a fired-up crowd into a frenzy. Vrana made Barry Trotz look like a genius for bumping him up the lineup but wasn't expecting to be his coach's plan B.\n",
      "\"That's just how the game rolls,\" said Vrana, who also assisted on Brett Connolly's first-period goal to give him three points. \"Sometimes you're gonna make changes. Today we did. We were all ready. I felt comfortable out there. Ready for next game.\"\n",
      "That next game, Monday night in Pittsburgh, is the Capitals' chance to advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in the Ovechkin era and for the first time overall since 1998 when they lost in the Cup Final. They may have to do it without star center Nicklas Backstrom, who left in the third period with an upper-body injury that Trotz said the team will have more information on Sunday.\n",
      "With Backstrom unable to play the final 13 minutes, Lars Eller double-shifted and Vrana looked like a perfect fit with Ovechkin and Kuznetsov. The Capitals are on the verge of beating Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and the Penguins for the first time in four playoff series dating to 2009 on the strength of top-end scoring and goaltending from Braden Holtby, who stopped 36 of the 39 shots he faced.\n",
      "\"Obviously Holts right now playing unbelievable,\" Ovechkin said. \"He's a big wall over there. When he play like that, it give us confidence.\"\n",
      "Confidence isn't lacking on either side. The Capitals hope they can build off an emotional victory, and the Penguins will try to win their fourth consecutive Game 6 after falling behind 3-2 in a series.\n",
      "\"Your desperation level is a little higher,\" said Crosby, who scored his ninth goal of the playoffs. \"You're aware of the situation, and that brings out the best in everybody. We knew it was going to be a tight series. We need to make sure we leave it all out there, give ourselves a chance to get back here.\"\n",
      "The Capitals ensured at least one more home game this postseason with goals by John Carlson and Connolly 33 seconds apart in the first period and a rebound effort in the third after being outshot 18-5 in the second. Pittsburgh got goals from Jamie Oleksiak at even strength and Crosby and Patric Hornqvist on the power play, often hanging goalie Matt Murray out to dry as he allowed four on 30 shots.\n",
      "Kuznetsov's goal brought out his bird-flapping celebration and awakened a crowd that booed the Capitals at the end of the second period. Vrana's goal was followed by deafening chants of \"Lets' Go Caps!\" at the next timeout, among the loudest in the building over Washington's decade-long run of contention.\n",
      "\"Tonight was one of those games where we needed to earn it from our fans,\" Holtby said. \"They probably think 'Here we go again' and we're not thinking that. We're thinking we're pushing forward, we're focusing on the moment and hopefully we gave them belief with that third period because this group in here believes in ourselves.\"\n",
      "NOTES: T.J. Oshie and Eller each scored an empty-netter in the final minutes to ice it. ... Trotz said Carlson was being evaluated after taking a high hit from Jake Guentzel late in the third period. ... The goals 33 seconds apart by Carlson and Connolly were the second-fastest in Capitals playoff history behind Craig Laughlin and Dave Christian (32 seconds) in 1984. ... Crosby took sole possession of second place on the Penguins' all-time playoff goals list with his 66th, breaking a tie with Jaromir Jagr. Crosby is 10 shy of Mario Lemieux for the most in franchise history. ... Carlson is 36th defenseman in history and third active with 10-plus power-play points in the playoffs. No defenseman has reached 11 power-play points in the postseason since Nicklas Lidstrom and Sergei Gonchar in 2009.\n",

      "CHICAGO — For Jeff Glass, there have been so many stops during his existence as a hockey vagabond, so many different jerseys that he has worn, so many teams he has tended goal for from Binghamton to Belarus and plenty of other outposts in between, and so many moments when it would have been easy for him to quit.\n",
      "There was the 38-game stretch in Siberia — where, to the best of Glass’s recollection, snow fell for 45 straight days. He played for the Kontinental Hockey League’s Sibir Novosibirsk then, and he found himself so far in the middle of nowhere that, as he put it, “all there was was hockey.”\n",
      "Now, after 13 years of wandering, Glass realizes that each step played a meaningful role in his finding his way to his N.H.L. debut last month as a 32-year-old rookie with the Chicago Blackhawks.\n",
      "“I never saw it playing out like this, being 32 years old and getting my chance,” Glass said. “But that’s my path and I’m proud of what I’ve had to do to get here.”\n",
      "Since making his inaugural appearance just 175 miles from his hometown, Calgary, Glass has registered a 3-2-1 record and a .910 save percentage while splitting time with his fellow backup Anton Forsberg.\n",
      "Since being called up, Glass has maintained a day-to-day, businesslike approach and has avoided becoming awe-struck in a room full of superstars. The Blackhawks (22-17-6) have struggled in ways that predate their three Stanley Cup championships since 2010. They are currently not in playoff position.\n",
      "But Glass’s feel-good story has resonated around the N.H.L. and even more so within the confines of the Blackhawks’ dressing room, where stars like Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews have become big-time Glass supporters.\n",
      "“It’s been pretty cool to have a front-row seat for it,” Kane said.\n",
      "Glass was playing in Canada’s Western Hockey League when the Ottawa Senators drafted him in 2004 with the 89th pick. From there he went to Charlotte of the East Coast Hockey League, then moved to Binghamton of the American Hockey League. In 2009 he signed with Barys Astana in Kazakhstan and headed to the Kontinental Hockey League.\n",
      "A world away from the N.H.L. rinks he aspired to play on, Glass discovered a passionate fan base and the opportunity to grow and develop in a place he could not even imagine living with his wife, Allie. Then his agent mentioned the possibility of continuing his career there. Glass’s K.H.L. journey took him to Spartak Moscow, CSKA Moscow, Lada Togliatti, Novosibirsk Sibir and Dinamo Minsk.\n",
      "Glass landed on the Blackhawks’ radar in 2014, when team officials were seeking a third goaltender to round out their system. Mark Bernard, the Blackhawks’ general manager of minor league affiliations, became aware of Glass’s track record and penchant for hard work, leadership and attention to detail.\n",
      "But Glass instead elected to return to the K.H.L., where he would play until 2016, when he decided his best route to the N.H.L. would probably travel through North America, where his career had started so many years before.\n",
      "Glass got a training camp invitation from the Toronto Maple Leafs and played briefly with the club’s A.H.L. affiliate. Glass later signed with the Blackhawks and was assigned to their A.H.L. team in Rockford, Ill., just 90 minutes outside Chicago. Bernard immediately sensed Glass was prepared to do whatever was necessary to reach the N.H.L.\n",
      "“He’s a guy that had a goal in mind — ‘I’m going to play in the N.H.L.,’” Bernard said.\n",
      "Glass made 20 starts for Rockford’s IceHogs last season, and another 18 this season. He had just returned from a two-day holiday break in Calgary when he received word the Blackhawks had placed Crawford on injured reserve.\n",
      "Glass was instructed to meet the team in Vancouver. Glass first contacted his wife, who was in Calgary with the couple’s newborn daughter, Lucy.\n",
      "As thrilled as he was, Glass realized he could not allow the promotion to change his approach.\n",
      "“It’s a big deal, but you try to remember, I’ve been doing this for a long time, this isn’t my first year pro by any means,” Glass said. “It’s definitely a step up from where I had been playing, but all the years in Russia prepared me for this.”\n",
      "News of Glass’s call-up spread quickly. The congratulatory text messages and phone calls poured in from friends and family members, some of whom, Glass said, had not been in touch for years. As he prepared to join the Blackhawks, the freshly minted N.H.L. rookie could not help but think back on all of the steps that had brought him to this point.\n",
      "“Most guys might have said, ‘Hey, I want to get a real job and get on with Plan B,’” Blackhawks Coach Joel Quenneville said. “That’s a testament to how competitive he is and that dream of playing in the N.H.L. has got to be part of it.”\n",
      "Glass refuses to let the speed of the N.H.L. intimidate him. Same goes for the pressure of playing a role in moving the Blackhawks closer to a playoff berth. He cannot afford to predict how long he will remain while Crawford’s next steps are up in the air.\n",
      "Taking each day as it comes has always been part of Glass’s routine, and so he isn’t about to change a formula that has served him so well.\n",
      "“At the end of the day,” Glass said, “it’s just a matter of going out and stopping hockey pucks.”\n",

      "MOSCOW — The 11 World Cup cities — all in European Russia — don't always reflect the diversity of a country with dozens of native ethnic groups. With its largely Muslim population and distinctive local culture, Kazan offers a different perspective.\n",
      "With Germany, France and Spain all visiting in the group stage, fans will get to see some of Europe's biggest stars.\n",
      "Here's what you need to know about one of the 11 host cities in Russia:\n",
      "THE STADIUM\n",
      "The 45,000-seat Kazan Arena has a flowing, elegant design and was Russia's most modern stadium when it opened five years ago. Going from the city center, it's on the other side of the Kazanka river (a Volga tributary), so public transport is recommended.\n",
      "It hosted the 2015 world swimming championships in a temporary pool to capacity crowds, but has been barely 20 percent full on average for Rubin Kazan's league games this season.\n",
      "WHAT TO KNOW\n",

      "There's a mosque behind the walls of the historic Kazan Kremlin, but the city center abounds with bars and other nightlife. Occasionally you might hear the Tatar language — similar to Russian — spoken on the street.\n",

      "The central Baumanskaya street is pedestrianized and has many of Kazan's bars, restaurants and historic buildings. The white walls of the Kazan Kremlin are a short walk away.\n",
      "Local Tatar cuisine is great for fans of pastries, pies and stews, plus some honey desserts.\n",
      "Games will be shown on a big screen near the Family Center — just look for a giant bowl-shaped building on the riverfront. Fans can relax at artificial beaches along the Volga River, but swimming isn't recommended.\n",

      "After an almost flawless qualifying campaign, Iran will find it far tougher at the World Cup.\n",
      "Iran's route to the round of 16 from Group B could be blocked by defending European champion Portugal and 2010 World Cup winner Spain.\n",
      "But the Iberian teams have good reason to be wary. Iran was unbeaten in 10 qualifiers and did not concede a single goal in the first nine games. And the strongest backline in Asia was only breached by Syria once a place in Russia was already secure.\n",
      "Contesting back-to-back World Cups for the first time, Iran will be aiming for a first appearance in the knockout stage in its fifth attempt.\n",

      "Advertisement\n",
      "Queiroz has publicly reminded the Iranian federation of the need for perfection in the World Cup build-up, reflecting concerns about past preparations. While regional rival Saudi Arabia has secured friendlies with Germany and Italy, Iran warms up against Uzbekistan and Latvia.\n",

      "The experienced tactician has been in charge of Iran since 2011 and has taken the team to new heights.\n",
      "On the field, he has produced a disciplined and well-organized team that has an attacking threat. That success means that his regular run-ins with the federation and club coaches in Iran are tolerated. Queiroz's status is enhanced by previous experience coaching Real Madrid and Portugal.\n",
      "GOALKEEPERS\n",
      "Alireza Beiranvand is likely to get the nod in Russia.\n",
      "At 6-foot-4 (1.95 meters), Beiranvand is physically commanding, a fine shot-stopper and known for his distribution, especially with his long throws.\n",

      "MIDFIELDERS\n",

Lacking a superstar, Morocco often finds its best players in France, the Netherlands and Spain, where they parents emigrated to.\n",

      "LIVERPOOL, England — Josep Maria Bartomeu, the president of Barcelona, preferred to focus on what he had gained, rather than what he had lost.\n",
      "“We have earned €105 million,” or about $127 million, he said, “and there is more to invest in football, in assets. Let’s see what we do.”\n",
      "Almost exactly five months later, the watching world now has an answer. What Barcelona has done with all of that money, all of that opportunity, is sign Ousmane Dembélé, a 20-year-old French winger of bright promise, for an initial $126 million, and allocate even more — upward of $175 million, the second-highest fee in history — to the transfer of Philippe Coutinho, Liverpool’s Brazilian playmaker.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But the when is still uncertain. Jamie Carragher, the former Liverpool defender, might be expected to feel his former club should keep hold of one of its crown jewels until the end of the season. The best thing for Liverpool to do, he wrote on Twitter this week, is to agree on a “BIG fee” for Coutinho to leave during the summer, warning that Liverpool’s place in the top four would be “seriously risked” if he departed this month.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "From the player’s perspective, while it is a move he has long craved, the timing is less than ideal: Such a drastic change of scenery in a season that leads into a World Cup carries a little more risk than a key figure in Brazil’s plans might like (even if escaping the brute physicality of the Premier League might be an attraction).\n",
      "That is not to say there is no logic to it. Allowing Coutinho — earmarked as a long-term replacement for Andrés Iniesta — a six-month period to settle in would allow Barcelona to see him flourish more fully next season. More immediately, a move now also might ease the domestic workload on the 33-year-old Iniesta, meaning the team’s coach, Ernesto Valverde, could reserve him for Champions League adventures.\n",
      "Far more important than when, however, is why. As recently as September, Barcelona’s director of professional sports, Albert Soler, claimed the Neymar-inspired hyperinflation of Europe’s already superheated transfer market was “a model of football we are not used to” and insisted that Barcelona “won’t get involved in that.”\n",
      "Yet whenever Coutinho joins, Barcelona will possess two of the most expensive players of all time. P.S.G. and Manchester City might have started the fire, but Barcelona is happily fanning the flames, and it is doing so at a time when the club most at risk of being burned is Barcelona itself.\n",
      "It is now almost a decade since Pep Guardiola took charge of the team that would change soccer. In the summer of 2008, Guardiola was promoted from manager of Barcelona’s B team after only one season and handed the reins of a senior side that included Lionel Messi, Gerard Piqué, Iniesta, Xavi Hernández and, soon, Sergio Busquets.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Xavi — now in lucrative semiretirement in Qatar — apart, the spine of that team remains in place. It has been graceful to watch — Barcelona always is — but it is an aging team, its beauty slowly dimming, its glory gradually fading. Busquets is a comparative spring chicken, as is Ivan Rakitic, both 29. Messi, Piquè, Iniesta and Javier Mascherano are all the wrong side of 30.\n",
      "They are still expensive, though. Last year, Barcelona announced record revenues of $854 million, when its chief executive, Oscar Grau, boasted that “even teams in the N.F.L. and N.B.A.” did not make that much money.\n",

      "The club’s salary bill accounted for an eye-watering 63 percent of that (clubs are recommended to spend no more than 70 percent of turnover on salaries), even before a spate of renewals — including that of Messi — are taken into account. Barcelona’s squad is the highest-paid in all of soccer: more than Real Madrid, more than Manchester City, more than P.S.G.\n",
      "Barcelona is adamant it can afford it, though its existence is perhaps a little more hand-to-mouth than the scale of its wealth might suggest. Barcelona projects its revenues will increase again this year, breaking the $900 million mark, but then they will have to if the club is to keep pace with its rapidly inflating salaries.\n",
      "When P.S.G. deposited the $267 million check to cover Neymar’s buyout clause, Barcelona had a chance to break that cycle. As Bartomeu said, it was an “opportunity,” and a golden one.\n",
      "For years, Barcelona has recruited desperately poorly. It is a club that the world’s finest players would do almost anything to join — as Coutinho, and Luis Suárez before him, prove — and yet its approach to acquisitions is haphazard and chaotic.\n",
      "Last summer, what was supposed to be a move for P.S.G.’s Marco Verratti somehow became the sale of Neymar. A deal for Nice’s Ivorian midfielder Jean Michael Seri collapsed amid rumors that talks had only begun because Barcelona fans kept mentioning his name. Liverpool held firm on Coutinho.\n",
      "Last month, Atlético Madrid threatened to complain to FIFA about Barcelona’s pursuit of Antoine Griezmann. The club might have added Dembélé and Nélson Semedo last summer, two bright young things, but a midfield in desperate need of rejuvenation was bolstered only by Paulinho, 29, signed from China’s Guangzhou Evergrande.\n",
      "The current league standings might not suggest it, but Real Madrid has its future in hand. Barcelona remains locked to its past, seemingly unable to think about replacing the players that have brought so much success. Bartomeu has talked about re-energizing the production line of young talent from La Masia, its famed academy, but that seems more a pipe dream than a plan.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Five months ago, Barcelona had a fortune with which to rebuild itself. Whenever Coutinho arrives, most of that money will be gone. And yet the problems, the issues it has refused to confront for so long, will remain.\n",

      "PHILADELPHIA — When T. J. McConnell, a reserve guard for the Philadelphia 76ers, was married last summer, his brother and best friend surprised him at the end of the reception. The funky beat of a familiar song filled the room as the dance floor flooded with friends and family.\n",
      "McConnell knew the lyrics by heart:\n",
      "Here they come, Philadelphia,\n",
      "On the run, stand up and cheer!\n",
      "No. 1, Philadelphia,\n",
      "Here they come, team of the year!\n",
      "“Everyone went nuts,” McConnell said.\n",
      "The song was “Here Come the Sixers,” a disco-flavored anthem from 1975 that has become the soundtrack for the N.B.A.’s most precocious team. The 76ers are so young, they might as well take a school bus to their games. But they commemorate their victories by dancing to a song that practically struts down the street in bell-bottoms while shaking a tambourine.\n",
      "“It’s very strange,” said Terry Rocap, 70, a musician who performed on the original recording. “But it’s a good tune. People seem to like it.”\n",
      "The 76ers, under the direction of Scott O’Neil, their chief executive, have been dipping into the franchise’s past even as the team reinvents itself. Chris Heck, their president for business operations, cited the team’s new slate of uniforms, which quilt together several eras: There’s “Phila” lettering from 1960, stars from the 1970s and a collar taken from the jerseys worn by the 76ers during the 1982-83 season, when they last won an N.B.A. championship.\n",
      "“When Scott came in about five years ago, we got together and said, ‘We need to start bringing back what was great about the Sixers,’” Heck said. “Because the heritage is amazing.”\n",
      "That heritage also includes “Here Come the Sixers,” which O’Neil hoped to incorporate in recent seasons as a regular part of the game-night experience. But Heck said the rest of the staff voted to reserve it for home wins, which meant that nobody got to hear it much at all. (The Sixers were 10-72 just two seasons ago.)\n",
      "But success-starved fans of the team are optimistic. The 76ers employ several young players who are actually decent at basketball. And despite some recent growing pains, they should contend this season for their first playoff berth since 2012. Victories are hard-earned, though, and “Here Come the Sixers” is still something of a rare treat.\n",
      "“Scott’s always like, ‘I want to hear it more!’” Heck said. “And we’re like: ‘We love it, too. But we have to stay disciplined.’”\n",
      "The song urges fans to “clap your hands” and “stomp your feet” in support of “the team of the year,” which is, of course, the 76ers. For the musicians behind the song, its renaissance has been a pleasant surprise.\n",
      "“We figured the song would just be a fleeting moment of glory,” said Randy Childress, 68, who played bass guitar on the song. “But now it’s going to be on my epitaph.”\n",
      "At the time of the song’s creation, Childress was doing odd jobs for the 76ers while he finished his degree at Temple. He recalled that he once earned $500 for dressing up as a turkey at a game before Thanksgiving. A pair of female ushers, clad in pilgrim costumes, led him around.\n",
      "“I did all sorts of stupid stuff,” he said.\n",
      "As for the team itself, the 76ers were on the rise after years of yawn-inducing mediocrity. But Pat Williams, then the general manager, understood the 76ers needed to add some pep to the game-day experience if they were to draw larger crowds to the Spectrum, the team’s arena at the time.\n",
      "“We were trying to create the kind of atmosphere where it was a fun place to come,” he said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "So when Williams learned that Childress was in a rock band, he had an idea: Perhaps the 76ers needed their own theme song.\n",
      "Armed with a new assignment, Childress invited Rocap and a third bandmate named Joe Sherwood to his small apartment, where he had a four-track machine. They hammered out a demo, the original beat set by the steady dribble of a basketball.\n",
      "“Boink, boink, boink, boink,” Childress said.\n",
      "One morning, after watching “Sesame Street” with his 7-year-old daughter, Rocap arrived with lyrics:\n",
      "One, two, three-four-five, Sixers!\n",
      "Ten, nine, eight, 76ers!\n",
      "“And we’re going, ‘Oh, that’s great,’” Childress said. “So that’s where the initial burst came from, and then we built the whole song around it.”\n",
      "The band, known as Fresh Aire, wrote the song in E major, a key at the top of the vocal range for most male tenors. By pushing that range, Sherwood said, the song created energy. And in hopes of protecting its shelf life, over the years the band kept the lyrics free of references to specific players on the team — even the illustrious Julius Erving.\n",
      "On the track, the band harmonizes to an accompaniment that includes guitars, piano, bass and drums. Sherwood’s brother Richard gave the song some soul by jamming out on a Hohner Clavinet, a keyboard instrument at the height of cool in the 1970s thanks to Stevie Wonder.\n",
      "“My brother added a little riff,” said Joe Sherwood, 70, who began singing: “Here they come! Deedley deedley deeeee!”\n",
      "Williams, the Sixers’ general manager, appreciated how the song turned out — it was exactly what he wanted, he said — but the team kept its rollout subtle.\n",
      "“It really wasn’t a big deal,” Sherwood said. “There wasn’t any big hoopla or major announcement. They just started playing it.”\n",
      "World B. Free, 64, a former guard who now works as an ambassador for the team, was a first-year player when the song made its debut. Before home games, the song’s first few beats would reach the players as they took the floor. It became an even bigger deal once Erving, known as Dr. J, joined the team the next season.\n",
      "“We’d be coming out of the tunnel and the crowd would be getting juiced up,” Free said. “And then Doc would come out there with that big ol’ Afro and start throwing it down: Boom!”\n",
      "For better or for worse, the song has stuck with Free through the decades.\n",
      "“I hear it in my sleep,” he said.\n",
      "In the wake of “Here Come the Sixers,” other teams reached out to the band to write their theme songs, including one for the N.H.L.’s Washington Capitals called “Clap for the Caps.” But none of them had much staying power. And when Williams left the 76ers organization in 1986, the song more or less left with him.\n",
      "“But it had a good run,” Williams said.\n",
      "Childress, Rocap and Sherwood, meanwhile, spent several years touring and playing at clubs. Sherwood eventually started a recruiting business. Rocap became a professional window washer. Childress, who had studied architecture, began designing exhibits for trade shows and museums.\n",
      "The Sixers’ theme song was largely forgotten until the early 2000s, when it was resuscitated by Angelo Cataldi, a longtime host for Sports Radio 94WIP in Philadelphia.\n",
      "“We were really excited about the team, and we needed a song,” Cataldi said. “So we did some research and we found out there was really only one, and it was this ’70s disco thing, and it was dated and absurd. But that’s kind of our show.”\n",
      "Cataldi now regrets the part he played in keeping “Here Come the Sixers” alive — it’s not his favorite song, he said — but many others seem to have a more favorable opinion.\n",
      "Last season, Joel Embiid, the team’s effervescent center, celebrated a win against the Knicks by dancing to the song with several cheerleaders. Some of his teammates are similarly enchanted by it.\n",
      "“I actually play it all the time,” said McConnell, the 76ers guard. “My friends will be like, ‘Let me hear the song!’ And I’ll put it on.”\n",
      "When Williams, now senior vice president for the Orlando Magic, delivered the keynote address at a prayer breakfast in October, he was surprised by the entertainment: a rendition of “Here Come the Sixers” performed by Childress and Rocap.\n",
      "“I sat there listening, and I couldn’t believe what was happening,” Williams said. “These 700 people were carrying on like it was a Billy Graham crusade.”\n",
      "Williams said the reason for the song’s popularity was no secret.\n",
      "“Everybody likes to tap their toes and clap their hands,” Williams said. “Winning helps, too.”\n",

      "Is content still king?\n",
      "When AT&T announced its plan to take over Time Warner 10 months ago, Disney’s chief executive, Robert A. Iger, said the deal proved yet again that “content is king.”\n",
      "“Is the network — the platform — now most important?” asked Michael Olson, the consumer internet analyst who covers Netflix for Piper Jaffray, when we spoke last week.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The idea that content is king has long rested on the notion that distribution — in whatever form it takes — is a low-margin commodity, and the biggest share of profits flows to the creators of original programming, who can sell to the highest bidder.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In keeping with that philosophy, Disney made its biggest bets on intellectual property, acquiring Pixar ($7 billion), Marvel Entertainment ($4 billion) and Lucasfilm ($4 billion). Those bets have paid off handsomely for shareholders.\n",
      "But as internet streaming disrupts channels like cable and broadcast, Disney now appears to have set its sights on distribution — and a potential new revenue source.\n",
      "These technology giants already have huge user bases and open checkbooks. In July, Netflix said that it had achieved a larger-than-expected increase in subscribers, who now total 104 million, and that it was reaching about half of United States households.\n",
      "“Anyone who wants to compete directly with Netflix or the full spectrum of competitors who are getting into this space had better be ready for a long, hard fight and have very deep pockets,” said Mr. Olson at Piper Jaffray. “They have the money to spend on content, and they already have huge direct-to-consumer user bases and traffic.”\n",
      "Netflix got where it is today in part by licensing Disney’s popular children’s offerings and Disney- and Pixar-branded films. Neither company has disclosed what Netflix pays for those rights, but analyst estimates range from about $220 million to $300 million a year.\n",
      "As long as Netflix was primarily a distributor, it posed no threat to Disney, and offered a revenue source to complement Disney’s cable channels and movies. Investors cheered when the licensing deal was announced in 2012. But Netflix went from partner to competitor by spending heavily to create its own programming — especially in the coveted children’s market long dominated by Disney.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Next year Netflix is adding a new animated series based on Dr. Seuss’s “Green Eggs and Ham,” with Ellen DeGeneres as executive producer. It also has a deal with DreamWorks Animation for 300 hours of new children’s programming.\n",

      "“Disney served its purpose,” Mr. Olson said. Now, Netflix “has reached a critical mass of content and users where it doesn’t really need Disney anymore.”\n",
      "The question remains: Does Disney need Netflix? Disney will be losing substantial licensing revenue, betting that it can build its own direct-to-consumer model, capture the full value of its programming and find a new path to revenue growth as cable channels decline.\n",
      "And it’s hedging its bet. For now, Disney’s Marvel and “Star Wars” programming remains on Netflix. The most common criticism I heard wasn’t that Disney was trying to create its own direct-to-consumer model, but that it had waited too long.\n",
      "Still, nearly everyone agreed that if anyone can pull it off, it’s Disney — and only a few others.\n",
      "“After Disney, the possibilities drop off pretty precipitously,” Mr. Olson said.\n",
      "“Disney makes a lot of amazing content, and no one can replicate it,” said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst at Cowen & Company. “But they’re putting a significant revenue stream at risk. If they succeed, they’ll capture all the revenue, but may accelerate disrupting the cable bundle. And it may not succeed. Fifteen percent of a big number is a lot better than 100 percent of nothing.”\n",
      "As Mr. Creutz put it in a research note, Disney’s move is putting “a very settled and successful part of the business model” at risk and “more aggressively pushes the traditional content business into terra incognita.”\n",
      "Mr. Olson agreed. “If anyone can do it from a content perspective, it’s probably them, because of their unique brand awareness,” he said. “But they’re coming from way behind.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Investors didn’t like the uncertainty, or the prospect of a full-fledged war between Disney and Netflix. Disney stock dropped on the news and this week was trading at about $102 a share, down from $110 at the beginning of August. Netflix shares also dropped from their lofty perch, falling from $182 at the beginning of the month to $167 this week.\n",
      "But Kevin A. Mayer, Disney’s head of corporate strategy and business development, told me that his company’s move wasn’t a Disney vs. Netflix issue, but just the first step in a long-term growth strategy for Disney. “We can both do really well,” he said. “There’s no zero-sum game here.”\n",
      "Although it may seem a paradox, Mr. Mayer says he believes Disney’s move into direct-to-consumer distribution — not to mention the tech world’s rush into original programming — demonstrates that “content is everything these days.”\n",
      "Unlike the old world of cable and broadcast, “the barriers to entry for an over-the-top provider are pretty low,” he said, meaning a provider that distributes content directly to consumers through the internet. “All the consumer is buying is content, not the apparatus to deliver it. Netflix is only as good as its content and its brand. We’re already good at both.” (Netflix officials declined to talk to me for this column.)\n",
      "In short, from Disney’s perspective, Mr. Mayer said, “content is more king than ever.”\n",

      "Some took to Twitter to suggest new advertising slogans for United. “If we can’t beat out competitors, we’ll beat our customers” was one. “United Airlines: putting the hospital in hospitality” was another.\n",
      "“They’ll be studying this in business schools for years,” said Andrew Winston, a corporate strategy consultant and author of “The Big Pivot” and a recent article in Harvard Business Review about the United incident.\n",
      "Having recently completed a round trip from Newark to San Francisco on United, I wasn’t all that surprised that United appeared to be weathering the storm. When I booked my ticket, United offered the most convenient flight options at the cheapest fares, albeit just $12 or so less than American. So I booked on United, even though the Dao incident was fresh in my mind.\n",
      "My experience bears out an adage about airlines: People almost always opt for convenience and price, even while complaining loudly about crowded planes and a dearth of amenities. And now that there are just four major carriers in the United States, thanks to years of industry consolidation, many passengers don’t have all that much choice.\n",
      "“The barriers to customer movement are pretty high,” Mr. Winston said. “You’d think that consumer perceptions matter a lot, but given that the major carriers practically have a monopoly on many routes and airports, it’s not that easy to switch.”\n",
      "That said, once on board, I found the experience surprisingly pleasant. The flight took off on time and landed early. The snack I wanted was still available even though I was seated toward the back. My video screen malfunctioned, depriving me of an opportunity to watch the movie “Hidden Figures.” But the flight attendant was so empathetic, and tried repeatedly to fix the problem (rebooting the aircraft’s entire entertainment system several times) that I ended up reassuring her that I was happy to read a book. She gave me a voucher worth 5,000 frequent-flier miles or a $100 credit on a future flight, which seemed pretty generous for a minor incident.\n",
      "The return trip was even better. The plane was a mint condition Boeing 777-300ER, with an intriguing business-class layout I admired while on my way to coach. Back there, the seats were leather and unusually comfortable (even for someone as tall as I am.) The video equipment worked. I was surprised when a flight attendant offered me a complimentary meal. I told her it must be a mistake since I was in an ordinary coach seat.\n",
      "A United spokeswoman told me the airline had begun serving complimentary meals and drinks on many transcontinental flights beginning July 1, but only for Economy Plus passengers. She speculated that there may have been some extra meals on my flight, or I may have been upgraded to an Economy Plus seat without my realizing it. And she said the plane was probably one of the airline’s 11 new 777-300ERs, which are being broken in on transcontinental routes before moving to international ones.\n",
      "That flight also took off on time and landed early. (United said it had the best on-time arrival and departure performance of any carrier in the second quarter.)\n",
      "Maybe this simply reflects diminished expectations, but after the remarkably stress-free flight, I wondered if it might be a good idea to fly an airline soon after an embarrassing episode like the Dao incident on the theory that everyone will be on their best behavior.\n",
      "According to United, my experience wasn’t an anomaly, since the airline has put in a host of recent, post-Dao changes aimed at customer satisfaction. “To say we learned some lessons would be putting it mildly,” said Megan McCarthy, the United spokeswoman.\n",
      "Besides the free meals and drinks in Economy Plus, United is now offering up to $10,000 in compensation for passengers who give up their seats on overbooked flights. These issues will be resolved before boarding so no one gets dragged off after taking an assigned seat. (United said “involuntary denied boardings” had dropped 88 percent in June from a year earlier.) When the airline loses luggage, customers will no longer have to provide receipts to prove the value of what was in it. The airline will provide up to $1,500 in compensation, no questions asked.\n",
      "United has also set up a team based in Chicago to offer creative solutions to customer problems. Ms. McCarthy cited an example of providing a flight to a nearby airport and ground transportation to their destination if someone has been denied boarding on an overbooked flight.\n",
      "“That was the right thing to do,” said Steve Barrett, editor of PRWeek magazine. “They should have done it immediately. United made it a much bigger story than it ever would have been.”\n",
      "When I spoke to Mr. Barrett this week, he acknowledged that no boycott had materialized and United’s bookings were holding up, helped in part by a series of incidents at rival airlines suggesting that United wasn’t any worse.\n",
      "Still, United “has suffered considerable reputational damage,” Mr. Barrett said. “No one is going to forget that video anytime soon.”\n",
      "United is tying executive pay (not just Mr. Munoz’s) to customer satisfaction, and in its recent earnings report included a section on the “customer experience.” The airline said it would continue its renewed focus on the customer.\n",
      "“That’s great and I hope it’s true,” Mr. Winston said. The airlines “have spent the last 30 to 40 years building a culture that’s about maximizing profits. Employees and customers were just a cog in that strategic wheel. Maybe it takes an incident like this to make them realize they can be about something more than moving cattle in the cheapest possible way.”\n",

      "With encouragement from one of her managers, she took up rapping, and has released a pair of mixtapes that mold her off-the-cuff verve and improvised bon mots into something stickier. “Bodak Yellow” feels like one of her Instagram clips come to life, funny and self-aware and savage.\n",
      "But no female rapper has moved as quickly from street hit to chart topper, an assertive reframing of the pathways typically available to them. Trevor Anderson, a chart manager at Billboard focused on R&B and hip-hop, said, “We haven’t seen a song from someone brand new go up the charts this quick since Meghan Trainor,” noting that was typically the preserve of more established stars like Justin Bieber or Rihanna. That it happened “without a meme, without a dance, it makes it that much weirder,” he added.\n",
      "Cardi B has a thick voice — she swells her syllables until they take up all available space, and moves on and off the beat stealthily. Generally, she chops up her lines into small pieces — “They see pictures, they say, ‘Goals,’ bitch, I’m who they tryna be” — making more entry points, turning each into a sort of mini-chorus.\n",
      "Those are two different segments of New York’s music culture, and part of the reason Cardi B can move so effortlessly between them is that in a genre largely marked by heavy Southern inflections and intonations, she still speaks with the reassuring contours of New York street slang, filtered through a Spanish accent.\n",
      "Mr. Bieber’s addition to “Despacito” — an English-language star singing partly in Spanish — helped propel it to the top of the chart, but Cardi B might have a different approach in mind. This month, she released a Spanish remix of “Bodak Yellow” featuring the Dominican-American rapper Messiah, one of the key figures in the Latin trap movement. That genre — in essence, a Spanish-language version of American hip-hop — has been gaining popularity over the last couple of years, but it might be “Bodak Yellow” that gives it its breakout moment.\n",
      "Soon after its release, Spanish-language radio stations began playing “Bodak Yellow,” Mr. Bakula noted. That means that turning this English song Spanish may be the thing to take it to the top of the chart — a kind of reverse “Despacito” in the making.\n",

      "Consider the following four movie reviews:\n",
      "“Awesome!”\n",
      "“Awful!”\n",
      "“Criminally underrated!”\n",
      "“It is my sad duty to report that I was mildly disappointed!”\n",
      "The first two reactions are probably the analyses of amateur movie lovers, and the latter are more likely the declarations of professional critics, but still: All four are equally valid reactions to a movie-going experience. And all four are equally useless opinions, of no interest — unless that opiner can back up sentiment with sense. Analysis. A cogent explanation of the factors that go into passing personal judgment on a work of cinema. Reasonable minds can differ and all that, but the first requirement of any meaningful movie debate is a demonstration of that reason — beyond “I love Wes Anderson movies!” and “I can’t stand Wes Anderson movies!”\n",
      "In “Talking Pictures: How to Watch Movies,” Ann Hornaday provides a pleasantly calm, eminently sensible, down-the-middle primer for the movie lover — amateur, professional or Twitter-centric orator — who would like to acquire and sharpen basic viewing skills. An estimable movie critic at The Washington Post and a finalist for the 2008 Pulitzer Prize in criticism, Hornaday explains upfront that she did not grow up, in her words, as “a congenital movie geek”; rather, in a winding journalism career that began at Ms. magazine, she learned her craft on the job. In this way, she says, she is more like her readers than like a film studies major or a gender studies major or a was-Pauline-Kael-really-all-that? major. And, inspired by a series of instructional articles she assembled for her readers some years back, here she considers various aspects of filmmaking in chapters that roughly follow the timeline of production: screenplay, acting, production design, cinematography, editing, sound and music, and directing. (Missing from consideration: a grasp of cinema history and cultural context within which to assess Movie A in relationship to Movies B-Z.)\n",
      "Hornaday fortifies her observations with comments from film professionals — writers, actors, directors — interviewed for the project. She also peppers each chapter with suggested questions a conscientious viewer might want to ask in each category. The screenplay: “Did the movie flow? Did I care what happened next?” The acting: “Did the actors disappear completely into their roles?” The directing: “Did the movie reflect ambition and vision beyond simply recording performances?” Inevitably, as a seasoned critic, she asks questions that reinforce her own aesthetic preferences. And so, especially, does the recommended viewing she lists at the end of each chapter — certified examples of excellence that only the most insistent of contrarians might challenge, including “Casablanca” and “Chinatown” for screenplay, “The Hurt Locker” for directing, and Viola Davis in “Fences” for acting. (The book is current through 2016 and the triumph of “Moonlight.”)\n",
      "Since a professional critic is generally thought to be a genius when her opinion matches that of the reader and an idiot when it doesn’t — I have been hailed as both in my time — I can announce that Hornaday is a genius insofar as she loves the nonverbal, visual power of Alfonso Cuarón’s “Children of Men” as much as I do, and deftly dismisses the directorial stylings of Tom Hooper in “The King’s Speech” and “The Danish Girl” as “attractively appointed, visually inert parlor dramas.” Indeed, the author is so determinedly reasonable and adult in this levelheaded book that there is little incentive to argue with her criteria for what makes a movie “good” or “bad.”\n",
      "The downside, I suppose, is the lack of opportunity to call her an idiot. And that, to a certain portion of the opining, moviegoing public, is apparently almost as pleasurable an activity as drawing one’s own conclusion, backed by reason and emphasized by the turn of a thumb.\n",

      "Not long ago, after interviewing a venture capitalist onstage, I announced to the audience that we would take questions but no pitches. The first person at the microphone asked the investor to fund his start-up. I cringed as the second person started to pitch, too. Our educational event had quickly turned into a bad episode of “Shark Tank.”\n",
      "The following week, at a similar event, I saw a student ask a C.E.O. for her personal email address in front of the crowd. I’ve been stunned by the lengths people will go to at tech and business conferences to make a connection with a big name: sneaking backstage for a selfie, slipping business cards into briefcases, chasing them out the exit.\n",
      "Yet we’ve all been warned that it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. Success is supposed to come to the suave schmoozers and social butterflies.\n",
      "It’s true that networking can help you accomplish great things. But this obscures the opposite truth: Accomplishing great things helps you develop a network.\n",
      "Look at big breaks in entertainment. For George Lucas, a turning point was when Francis Ford Coppola hired him as a production assistant and went on to mentor him. Mr. Lucas didn’t schmooze his way into the relationship, though. As a film student he’d won first prize at a national festival and a scholarship to be an apprentice on a Warner Bros. film — he picked one of Mr. Coppola’s.\n",
      "Not long ago, I watched a colleague try to climb the ladder of success solely through networking. For a few years, he managed to meet increasingly influential people and introduce them to one another. Eventually it fell apart when they realized he didn’t have a meaningful connection with any of them. Networking alone leads to empty transactions, not rich relationships.\n",
      "It’s a lesson I’ve learned in my own career. I once emailed an entrepreneur I admired and got nothing in response. Some months later he contacted me out of the blue, with no memory that I had tried to get in touch before. He had attended a talk I gave and wanted to meet — now he had proof that I could add value.\n",
      "My students often believe that if they simply meet more important people, their work will improve. But it’s remarkably hard to engage with those people unless you’ve already put something valuable out into the world. That’s what piques the curiosity of advisers and sponsors. Achievements show you have something to give, not just something to take.\n",
      "So stop fretting about networking. Take a page out of the George Lucas and Sara Blakely playbooks: Make an intriguing film, build a useful product.\n",
      "In life, it certainly helps to know the right people. But how hard they go to bat for you, how far they stick their necks out for you, depends on what you have to offer. Building a powerful network doesn’t require you to be an expert at networking. It just requires you to be an expert at something.\n",
      "If you make great connections, they might advance your career. If you do great work, those connections will be easier to make. Let your insights and your outputs — not your business cards — do the talking.\n",

      "Ric Edelman disappoints in his new investing book, left. Gary Smith offers financial formulas to help identify value stocks in his new book, “Money Machine.”\n",
      "With the stock market up substantially since the first of the year, and technological innovations continuing to roil the corporate landscape, how should you invest right now?\n",
      "Two new books offer very different answers, with each taking an unconventional approach.\n",
      "In the far better one, “Money Machine: The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing” (Amacom, $27.95), Gary Smith, a Pomona College economics professor, says you should concentrate on value stocks. In contrast, in “The Truth About Your Future: The Money Guide You Need Now, Later and Much Later” (Simon & Schuster $26), Ric Edelman says you need to figure out how to capitalize on trends disrupting how business is typically done.\n",
      "Let’s begin with Mr. Smith, who does an excellent job explaining his position.\n",
      "“Instead of trying to predict short-term zigs and zags in stock prices, value investors evaluate individual stocks and the market as a whole by looking for good companies that have low stock prices relative to their dividends, earnings and assets,” he writes.\n",
      "Mr. Smith uses an analogy to make his case.\n",
      "“Think of a stock as a machine that generates cash every few months — cash that happens to be called dividends,” he writes. “The key question is how much you would pay to own that machine in order to get the cash. This is the stock’s intrinsic value. Value investors buy a stock because it is an inexpensive money machine, generating bountiful cash it is hoped over many years.”\n",
      "Throughout the book, Mr. Smith provides financial formulas to help you identify value stocks, and his writing is clear and often clever. For example:\n",
      "The book, however, does have its flaws — one major, a couple minor.\n",
      "The big one first: It is perfectly defensible to pick one approach to investing — such as loading up on value stocks, companies with solid revenues, earnings and dividends that are trading at a relatively low price — over all others. As Mr. Smith points out a number of times, Warren E. Buffett is a value investor. And this reviewer understands that Mr. Buffett has done quite well.\n",
      "But financial mavens like Mr. Buffett, the maestro of Berkshire Hathaway, are rare, and as Mr. Smith himself points out, “very few investors think they are below average, even though half are.” Most of us would be better off with a widely diversified portfolio, something Mr. Smith barely acknowledges.\n",
      "As for the minor nits, Mr. Smith tends to digress, mentioning academic papers he wrote that are at best tangential to the concept of value investing. For example, he says that stocks with ingenious ticker symbols, such as MOO for VanEck Vectors Agribusiness ETF, tend to outperform the market. That is a fun fact — especially for us financial nerds — but I am not sure what it has to do with the matter at hand, and I would not recommend an investment based solely on a cute name.\n",
      "Similarly, while it is possible that a home could be viewed as a value investment, as he explains, I am not sure the discussion was worth 20 pages of a 300-page book.\n",
      "These are small quibbles. For the most part, he states his case well.\n",
      "“The value-investing philosophy is simple,” he writes. “Look for great companies whose stocks are inexpensive relative to their dividends and earnings.”\n",
      "That clarity and brevity are lacking in Mr. Edelman’s book. He is a financial planner, but readers expecting detailed investment advice will be disappointed.\n",
      "For example, after writing that it is vital to diversify your investments among stocks, bonds, cash and perhaps other investments such as real estate, how does Mr. Edelman respond to his rhetorical question “how much of your portfolio should be placed into each” of those assets?\n",
      "Like this: “The answer is … it depends. I wish I could provide you a more specific answer right now, but this is just a book on personal finance — it’s not a private, in-depth meeting with a financial planning professional.”\n",
      "He doesn’t even offer general guidelines. He just moves on.\n",
      "This is already my pick for the most frustrating personal finance book of 2017. And one of the reasons I am so annoyed is that the premise was so promising.\n",
      "“Financial planning is all about anticipating and preparing for the future,” Mr. Edelman writes. “So to understand what your future will be like, you need to understand why it’s going to be so radically different from what you have been assuming.”\n",
      "He then devotes about two-thirds of his more than 300 pages to underscoring things we know but can easily forget: Medical advances could make us live longer, ever-evolving technology will provide more engaging entertainment options, and rapidly evolving workplaces will require continuous education, perhaps extensive enough for us to have to leave the workplace for a while to concentrate on learning new things.\n",
      "So far, so good. But what do these changes mean for the way we invest? Well, when it comes to leisure and learning, for example, Mr. Edelman’s advice is just this: “Expect to spend lots of money on travel and recreation — and this will need to be factored into your financial plan.” How?

      "Hedge funds have been failing over the last year at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2008. Some crashed and burned after sudden reversals. Others quietly liquidated.\n",
      "Then there’s Edward S. Lampert’s ESL Investments. It hasn’t failed, but may be setting a benchmark for slow, painful declines thanks to its outsize, long-term bet on two venerable retailers, Sears and Kmart.\n",
      "Sears said that the statement reflected a new, more stringent accounting rule, and that the company was in no imminent danger of bankruptcy. “We are a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future,” said Jason Hollar, Sears’s chief financial officer.\n",
      "Still, coming after seven straight years of huge losses, the announcement seems a milestone on a road that has only one likely end.\n",
      "“It takes a retailer like Sears a long time to die,” said Greg Melich, senior managing director and head of consumer research for Evercore, and the last Wall Street analyst still covering Sears. “It’s been burning through over a billion dollars in cash every year. That’s not sustainable.”\n",
      "Sears Holdings has long been ESL’s largest investment, along with other Sears assets Mr. Lampert spun off, such as the struggling Lands’ End. (The two holdings accounted for nearly half the fund’s holdings at the end of the year, according to its most recent securities filings.) Sears Holdings shares were $162 in 2006; this week they were barely above $11.\n",
      "Few hedge fund managers have been as celebrated as Mr. Lampert in his heyday, which now appears to be the mid-2000s. Mr. Lampert was a Wall Street wunderkind, a Goldman Sachs intern whose intellect, ingratiating personality and prodigious work ethic attracted the patronage of some of America’s most prominent and successful investors: Robert Rubin, Mr. Lampert’s mentor at Goldman; Richard Rainwater, who invested for the billionaire Bass brothers before starting his own firm; and David Geffen, the billionaire entertainment mogul.\n",
      "Mr. Lampert was 25 years old and at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he founded ESL in 1988 with $28 million in seed money from Mr. Rainwater.\n",
      "No one compares Mr. Lampert to Mr. Buffett anymore. His high-profile investors are, for the most part, long gone. Mr. Tisch, who’s also a director of Sears, is described as steadfastly loyal. Steven Mnuchin, Mr. Lampert’s roommate at Yale and now Treasury secretary, disclosed last year that he had a $26 million investment in ESL. (Mr. Mnuchin said he would divest the position.)\n",
      "Notably, a group of Goldman Sachs clients who had invested $3.5 billion in 2007 bailed out of the fund in 2013. Their exit “pretty much says it all” as far as investor confidence in Mr. Lampert goes, Mr. Melich said.\n",
      "Where did someone as smart, successful and hard-working as Mr. Lampert go wrong? His initial concept to combine two iconic but deeply distressed retailers — Kmart and Sears — initially appealed to many investors as a classic investment in undervalued, poorly managed assets in the Warren Buffett style. But Mr. Buffett doesn’t personally manage his portfolio companies. Several former Lampert investors told me that Mr. Lampert’s fundamental mistake was one common to many once-successful hedge fund managers: hubris, and the belief that investment prowess would translate into management skill.\n",
      "“He was a very successful investor before he took over Kmart and Sears,” said Mark Cohen, former chief executive of Sears Canada and a professor at Columbia Business School, where he’s the director of retail studies. (Mr. Cohen left Sears Canada before Mr. Lampert arrived.)\n",
      "“He seemed to think he was smarter than anyone in the retail business, but he had no idea how to run the company from Day 1,” Mr. Cohen said. “One thing I teach is that core competencies are the basis for success or failure. Lampert had no experience in retail, and no management competency whatsoever.”\n",
      "Sears and other brick-and-mortar retail chains, of course, have been battered over the last decade by forces beyond Mr. Lampert’s control, especially the rise of internet retailing. Mr. Lampert claims to have foreseen the trend. If so, he’s had scant success carrying out a strategy to deal with it.\n",
      "His one consistent approach over the years has been to cut costs drastically. Initially, it seemed to work, increasing cash flow and earnings. “There’s a philosophy to that,” Mr. Melich said, but Sears “grossly underinvested in areas that proved to be very relevant to the future of merchandising, such as multichannel retailing.”\n",
      "He pointed to the contrast between Sears and Home Depot, whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years, despite the internet and competition from Amazon.\n",
      "Mr. Lampert has shown more prowess as a financial engineer, and has seemingly squeezed Sears’s once formidable assets for every penny of value through a continuing series of asset sales, spinoffs, dividend payouts and loans secured by Sears assets. Mr. Lampert has emphasized that because he is Sears’s largest shareholder, his interests are aligned with other Sears shareholders.\n",
      "But the perception persists that many of these deals have benefited Mr. Lampert more than shareholders, since he’s often on both sides of the transactions.\n",
      "Over the last two years alone, Mr. Lampert and ESL have extended Sears over $800 million in loans secured by Sears assets — nearly two-thirds as much as Sears’s entire market capitalization of $1.2 billion. That makes Mr. Lampert and ESL the largest Sears creditors, giving them vastly different interests than most shareholders. (ESL Investments holds 48 percent of Sears Holdings’s equity and 32 percent of its total long-term debt.) As creditors, they could end up owning Sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy, while other Sears shareholders would be wiped out.\n",
      "Last month, Mr. Lampert and the Sears board agreed to pay $40 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that Sears’s sale and lease-back of much of its most valuable real estate to a real estate investment trust — 43 percent owned by Mr. Lampert and his ESL hedge fund — was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed Sears shareholders. Sears has denied any wrongdoing and said it had settled the suit merely to avoid “protracted litigation.”\n",
      "Mr. Lampert “has stripped Sears of its assets,” Mr. Cohen said. “It’s the longest liquidation in retail history. His reputation in the retail community is that he’s a financial pirate.”\n",
      "Like most hedge fund managers, Mr. Lampert continues to get a management fee no matter how poorly the fund’s assets perform.\n",
      "Still, Sears’s travails and their impact on ESL’s results have clearly taken a toll on Mr. Lampert’s own fortunes. Although Mr. Lampert probably shows substantial gains on his original investment in Sears and Kmart, “he and ESL investors can’t have fared very well over the past six or seven years,” Mr. Melich said.\n",
      "Mr. Lampert remains one of the country’s richest people. He owns lavish homes in Greenwich, Conn.; Aspen, Colo.; and Miami as well as a 288-foot yacht, Fountainhead, named after the Ayn Rand novel (Mr. Lampert is a devotee of the author). Last year Forbes ranked him tied for No. 309 on its annual list of the 400 richest Americans, with a net worth of $2.3 billion.\n",
      "But that’s a billion-and-a-half dollars less than Forbes estimated back in 2006. Since then, Mr. Bezos has vaulted to No. 2 on the Forbes list, just behind Bill Gates, with a net worth of $67 billion. Had Mr. Lampert simply put his fortune in a stock market index fund rather than gaining control of Sears and Kmart, he would have fared far better.\n",
      "Through a spokesman, Mr. Lampert declined to comment.\n",
      "Even his critics concede that Mr. Lampert has been stubbornly consistent, refusing to throw in the towel on Sears even after years of deteriorating results. In a news release last week, he showed no signs of backing down, pledging yet another “fundamental restructuring” of Sears.\n",
      "His strategy? Cutting “at least $1 billion in costs on an annualized basis.”\n",

      "Having reached the top of a major corporation and amassed a fortune, chief executives often wonder: What’s next?\n",
      "After Donald J. Trump, the answer may well be a run for the White House.\n",
      "Mr. Trump had no political or military experience, the traditional routes to high political office. Virtually his only qualification was his business career, and a checkered one at that, considering his own brush with personal bankruptcy.\n",
      "“There is this sense that if Trump got it, why shouldn’t they?” said David Gergen, co-director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser to four presidents. “They’ve been more successful, they have more experience, and they’ve run a public company, which is more equivalent to what a president does than a private company” like the Trump Organization.\n",
      "Stu Loeser, once the press secretary for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year, concurred. “If you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people, and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful, and you look at a sitting president who, to be honest, a lot of business people don’t have much respect for, you think, why not me?” he said.\n",
      "Mr. Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm, and told me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office. “I can’t tell you their names, obviously,” he said.\n",
      "Boldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks, Robert A. Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.com, along with Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook chief operating officer, and Oprah Winfrey, chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc., which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey Network.\n",
      "All deny they’re running, or even seriously considering it. But everyone demurs so far ahead of the first primaries, as did Hillary Clinton four years ago, and it hasn’t stopped anyone from speculating. That’s especially the case for people who, appalled by the Trump administration, can hardly wait for the next campaign.\n",
      "“I feel many of these chief executives are responding to a public longing for a strongman, or woman, a strong leader,” Mr. Gergen said. “There’s a sense that’s why Trump got elected. You’re seeing the same thing in Europe, in Asia, in a long list of countries. People are dissatisfied with standard politicians. Military types and business people with a strong track record offer an attractive alternative.”\n",
      "Apart from proven business experience, they have widespread name recognition or identification with major consumer brands. And they have enough money to finance their own campaigns.\n",
      "I’ve spoken this week to multiple people who have at least discussed the possibility of running for office with Mr. Schultz and Mr. Iger. (All declined to be named discussing what were private conversations.)\n",
      "Mr. Schultz, 63, with a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion, came close to making a bid last year, but backed out after concluding it would be very difficult to defeat Mrs. Clinton, who seemed to have the Democratic nomination all but locked up and at the time seemed likely to win the presidency.\n",
      "Those circumstances have obviously changed drastically. With Mr. Trump in office, the next Democratic race appears wide open, and many friends and potential donors are urging Mr. Schultz to run.\n",
      "Mr. Schultz seemed to pave the way in December, when he announced he’d step down as Starbucks’ chief executive this April. But he continues to be actively involved in the expansion of the company’s high-end “roasteries” as well as its social-impact initiatives.\n",
      "“Howard Schultz is definitely being pursued,” Mr. Gergen said. “He has a powerful social conscience. He comes from a very different place than the kind of chief executive with a big ego who wants the trappings of presidential power.”\n",
      "Mr. Schultz declined to comment.\n",
      "Last year Mr. Iger, 66, told The Hollywood Reporter that “a lot of people — a lot — have urged me to seek political office,” and last week the entertainment publication fueled renewed speculation when it reported that Mr. Iger had discussed the possibility with Mr. Bloomberg.\n",
      "People who have discussed a possible presidential run with Mr. Iger told me that his discussion with Mr. Bloomberg, some years ago, focused more on a possible run for mayor of New York City, where Mr. Iger has an apartment. New York has long welcomed nonresident candidates like Mrs. Clinton, so Mr. Iger’s California residency isn’t seen as an obstacle.\n",
      "Both Mr. Iger and Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment.\n",
      "Whether any of those jobs, including the presidency, would actually be better than being chief executive of Disney remains an open question. After earlier announcing his retirement, Mr. Iger recently said he was willing to extend his contract, which would eliminate the need for any high-profile exit strategy, at least for the next few years.\n",
      "Campaign buttons emblazoned with “Vote for Benioff” and “Marc Benioff for President” circulated two years ago at Salesforce’s annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco, which draws hundreds of thousands of participants and has been viewed by some as a likely launching pad for any Benioff campaign.\n",
      "Like Mr. Schultz, Mr. Benioff has pursued an ambitious social and philanthropic agenda. He started “Pledge 1%,” the Salesforce model of donating 1 percent of their product, 1 percent of their equity and 1 percent of employees’ time to help nonprofits achieve their missions — a practice that Salesforce says is now followed by 1,400 companies. Mr. Benioff was an outspoken defender of gay and lesbian rights and helped create a network of corporate leaders to oppose bills limiting L.G.B.T. rights in states like Indiana, Georgia and North Carolina.\n",
      "Mr. Benioff, 52, whose stake in Salesforce alone is worth over $3 billion and who has a net worth estimated by Forbes at over $4 billion, has also written three books, including the best-selling “Behind the Cloud.” Still, he’s hardly a household name, and is best known in business and technology circles.\n",
      "Asked for comment, Mr. Benioff said, “Business is the greatest platform for change.”\n",
      "Ms. Sandberg’s coming nationwide tour to promote the new book she co-authored, “Option B,” which describes coming to terms with her husband’s sudden death in 2015 and other stories of coping with adversity, has fueled speculation (and possible wishful thinking) that the book could be a springboard for a presidential campaign.\n",
      "As a billionaire ($1.47 billion, Forbes estimates) and a key executive of the hugely successful Facebook, Ms. Sandberg already has enormous name recognition. Her previous book, “Lean In,” was a best-seller and inspired a rallying cry for women. She has worked in politics before, as an assistant to the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H. Summers, and was a donor to Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. She was considered a candidate for a top post in any Clinton administration.\n",
      "Ms. Sandberg has denied any immediate presidential ambitions, insisting that she loves her job at Facebook. At age 47, she’s under no pressure to run this election cycle.\n",
      "(Widespread reports that the Facebook founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, would run for president seem even more far-fetched. The speculation appears to have been set off by a Bloomberg News report that Mr. Zuckerberg would retain voting control of Facebook even if he sold his shares and served in a government position for up to two years. Mr. Zuckerberg has denied any interest in running.)\n",
      "Then there’s Ms. Winfrey, 63, who for many Democrats might amount to the dream candidate: She has unrivaled star power, is an African-American woman, has run a successful business, and has a fortune estimated by Forbes at $3 billion.\n",
      "“That’s what I thought,” Ms. Winfrey replied. “I thought, ‘Oh gee, I don’t have the experience, I don’t know enough.’ And now I’m thinking, ‘Oh! Oh.’”\n",
      "But when Mr. Rubenstein began to ask, “As you consider whether you are going to run for president of the United States or not. ..,” she interjected, “No, that won’t be happening.”\n",
      "While some may disparage Mr. Trump’s credentials for the presidency, he did bring to his campaign a level of recognition that will be hard for other executives to replicate, with the possible exception of Ms. Winfrey.\n",
      "“Trump spent decades building his brand and his image as a successful businessman,” Mr. Loeser said. “He was the star of one of the most-watched television shows in America. If you landed at La Guardia, you saw the Trump jet. If you went to Las Vegas, the tallest building in town has Trump’s name emblazoned on it.”\n",
      "Mr. Gergen agreed. “Trump has been a performer for years,” he said. “Most chief executives aren’t performers.”\n",
      "And chief executives “aren’t prepared for the scrutiny,” Mr. Gergen said. “It’s especially tough to work with the press. They’re used to having layers of people around them, but in politics you’re out there dealing with reporters every day.”\n",
      "“Look at Rex Tillerson,” he added, referring to the Exxon chief turned secretary of state. “He’s extremely well regarded in corporate circles, but he’s having trouble with the press.”\n",
      "Mr. Loeser said he was helping clients assess the kind of attacks they could expect in a hard-fought campaign.\n",
      "“You have to anticipate how they’ll come after you, because they will,” Mr. Loeser said. “Oprah is one of the most beloved people in America. But has anyone gone through every minute and every hour of every show she’s ever done to see if there’s anything controversial? Because someone will.”\n",
      "Mr. Gergen suggested that some chief executives might want to lower their sights. “I think business chief executives tend to make better governors or mayors,” he said. “They can be more pragmatic and less ideological. Some of the names you’re hearing, I have trouble picturing them with the Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders wing of the party. I wouldn’t call that a match made in heaven.”\n",

      "(Reuters) - Toy maker Hasbro Inc has agreed to acquire children's entertainment and merchandising franchises, including the characters of the superhero TV show Power Rangers, from Saban Entertainment for around $520 million in cash and stock, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.\n",

      "James Andrew Miller’s “Powerhouse: The Untold Story of Hollywood’s Creative Artists Agency” has a terrific subject for a sprawling narrative, since CAA has been at the vortex of Hollywood and commerce for more than four decades. The story has great characters, plenty of boldface names and surprising twists.\n",
      "“Almost any of Shakespeare’s political tragedies, or comedies, could serve as road maps to the backstage drama surrounding CAA through the decades,” Miller writes. “CAA long ago ceased to be a traditional talent agency, and what started out as a television representation business had since spiraled into movies, music, investment banking, advertising, marketing and most recently, sports.”\n",
      "As in his previous books (with a co-­author, Tom Shales), “Live From New York” (about “Saturday Night Live”) and “Those Guys Have All the Fun” (ESPN), Miller is mostly an invisible hand. “Powerhouse” is largely a series of direct quotations strung together in more or less chronological and topical order. While I wouldn’t go so far as to call the story “untold” (many of the key events were widely reported and written about), Miller has done an extraordinary number of interviews (more than 500, he says), and simply organizing and piecing together this wealth of material is a feat. Even more impressive is Miller’s ability to get nearly everyone involved not only to talk but also to go on the record, which is remarkable given the notorious culture of secrecy in Hollywood.\n",
      "Still, there are drawbacks to this approach. Few sources are naturally good storytellers, even in the entertainment business. It’s hard for Miller to build up much narrative steam, and just when he gets it going, someone rambles off on a tangent. Some sections are filled with tedious details only an insider could ­appreciate.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "There are too many sources doubling as characters and too many walk-on appearances. (You get a sense of what you’re in for when the cast of characters at the front of the book runs to 11 single-spaced, ­double-columned ­pages.)\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Transitions are nonexistent, jarring or confusing. At times Miller has to abandon the quotations and supply some much-needed connective tissue. This is also an inefficient way to tell a story — I’d estimate a more conventional narrative could have done the job in half the book’s 700-plus pages. But for readers with the patience to sift through all this semi-raw material, “Powerhouse” delivers a chronicle of vaunting ambition, immense wealth and power, and personal betrayal all the more astonishing in a business ostensibly built on loyalty and trust.\n",
      "Michael Ovitz and Ron Meyer, the most important of the five co-founders of CAA, loom large as both quoted sources and the most fully developed and fascinating characters. They had a remarkably close and symbiotic relationship, Meyer warm and affable, Ovitz cerebral and tough. “I didn’t trust anyone in my life more than Ron Meyer — no one, except for maybe my wife,” Ovitz says.\n",
      "They had help from others, but it was their fierce determination, hard work and single-minded devotion to clients and CAA that turned a fledgling talent agency into an entertainment colossus. It’s no wonder being an agent is a young person’s job: The actress Ali MacGraw packed her suitcase and walked out of a passionate romance with Meyer when he wouldn’t get off the phone with a client early one Saturday morning. (He says he doesn’t blame her.)\n",
      "Ovitz was once widely acknowledged as the most powerful man in Hollywood, perhaps the most powerful business person in Hollywood ever (at his peak even President Clinton was eating out of his hand). When Earvin (Magic) Johnson suggested Ovitz might someday run a studio, he replied: “Earvin, I don’t have to run a studio. I run them all now anyway.”\n",
      "Then Ovitz overreached and fell ignobly to earth. He blew opportunities to run two major studios — Universal and Sony — by making outrageous demands for autonomy and compensation. But why wouldn’t he have? He’d built a career on outrageous demands — for both himself and his clients — and they were invariably met.\n",
      "After CAA orchestrated the wildly successful 1993 polar bear ad campaign for Coca-Cola, a senior Coke executive put a $10 million check, payable to Ovitz, in the hands of a toy polar bear and had it delivered to the company. Ovitz returned the check, unendorsed, with a sticky note: “Let’s discuss this.” Ovitz eventually got $31 million.\n",
      "In 1995 Meyer was sent by Ovitz to New York to meet Edgar Bronfman Jr. (the Seagram’s heir and chief executive, who had just gained control of Universal) and to salvage Ovitz’s shot at running the studio. Meyer emerged with the job himself. “That’s when Ron lost me as a friend,” Judy Ovitz says. “He turned around and took the job that should have gone to Michael.” Ovitz, who never missed an hour let alone a day of work, was so stunned and depressed, people said, that he didn’t come into the office for a week.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "With Meyer out and a new generation at CAA — the so-called Young Turks — chafing to take over, Ovitz’s days at the agency he founded were numbered. In his own telling, he was “burned out.”\n",

      "For an exit commensurate with his stature, Ovitz accepted an offer from Michael Eisner to be president of Disney. After Meyer, Ovitz probably considered Eisner his best friend, and their two families had been close for years. Ovitz thought — ­erroneously — they’d be running the company as equals. Eisner fired Ovitz after little more than a year.\n",
      "A measure of Ovitz’s power was the vindictiveness with which former friends and colleagues greeted his downfall — none more so than his successors at CAA. As Miller puts it, “Just about anybody in Hollywood with a triple-digit I.Q. heard, firsthand or remotely, about how much the Young Turks resented and even ­hated him.” This seems especially ungrateful since Ovitz had paid them lavishly, ­handed them clients, built the agency and then sold it to them for the bargain price of $175 million. (By 2010, it was valued at $700 million.)\n",
      "True, the Turks — Kevin Huvane, Bryan Lourd, Richard Lovett, Jay Moloney and David O’Connor — thought they’d been lied to or misled about matters large and small: who earned what; whether CAA owned a private jet; who had an equity stake in CAA’s headquarters building. But none of that seems adequate to explain the intensity of their resentment (which the more genial Meyer seems to have escaped). Miller speculates: “The Young Turks were prodigal sons, with the agency functioning like the trust fund a rich kid gets when turning 25.”\n",
      "But the Turks seem to have risen to the challenge. They had to cope not only with the inevitable upheavals that accompany succession but also with tectonic changes in the entertainment business, starting with the collapse of the DVD market and the withering of revenues from feature films, which once contributed the major portion of CAA’s profits.\n",
      "These new leaders had to rethink the nature of the agency business, pushing boldly beyond marketing and investment banking, the expanded boundaries Ovitz and Meyer had laid down. It’s hard to manage change of that magnitude.\n",
      "For CAA, the biggest financial change came in 2010, when it sold a 35 percent stake to one of the biggest and most successful private equity firms, TPG Capital, for $166 million. TPG got a majority share four years later in a financing deal that raised another $435 million, which lifted the value of CAA to more than $1 billion. The infusion of capital enabled the company to become a principal — not just an intermediary — by investing its own capital in projects.\n",
      "It’s too soon to know how that’s going to turn out. We may find out if and when CAA is sold again or goes public, which, for a private equity firm like TPG, would typically be seven to nine years after making the investment.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Miller suggests CAA’s best days are behind it. Today, only three of the Young Turks remain at the firm. Moloney, the one closest to Ovitz, who had been viewed as his chosen successor, died in 1999 after struggling with cocaine addiction, apparently by suicide. After 32 years at CAA, O’Connor left in 2015 to become chief executive of Madison Square Garden.\n",
      "CAA is now big and impersonal and focused on the bottom line, which seems to have taken a lot of the fun out of being an agent there (not to mention reading about them). Even so, if money and power are the measure of success in Hollywood, then access to the hundreds of millions in capital TPG delivered gives CAA the potential to be far more powerful than anything Ovitz and Meyer ever envisioned.\n",
      "But money and power may not be the only or even best measure of success in Hollywood. Perhaps I’m naïve, but I came away from the book with the sense that CAA’s most enduring legacy will be the impact its agents had on the lives and careers of their many clients, amply documented in “Powerhouse.” The best of the entertainment they created will be remembered long after CAA is gone.\n",
      "“I think it’s a ghastly way to make a living,” Ali MacGraw says of the agent business. “But if you’re really good at it like Ron was, you must gain some tremendous happiness by changing people’s lives so dramatically.”\n",
      "Ovitz may still be reviled by some, but not his clients. “I’ve never known anybody like Mike Ovitz,” David Letterman says. “There is nobody like him. He was such an overwhelming positive force, and in show business there are not many positive ­forces. He put me back on my feet. It’s comparable to my heart surgery, for God’s sake.”\n",

      "But there is at least one prominent example of a country’s top elected official continuing to own a major business empire while in office. And even if the parallel is not exact, it’s hardly encouraging: Silvio Berlusconi, who served nine years as Italy’s prime minister.\n",
      "The two men share many qualities apart from their mutual admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and attractive women. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi is a billionaire. He initially made his fortune as a real estate developer, then diversified into banking, advertising, publishing, news and entertainment media and ownership of the European soccer club A.C. Milan.\n",
      "Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi was elected prime minister as a change agent, called the novus homo of a populist uprising. As in the United States, (and unlike most European countries) no conflict-of-interest laws in Italy prevent the prime minister from owning a business. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi faced calls to divest his sprawling business empire.\n",
      "Mr. Berlusconi resigned all his executive positions and directorships and pledged to have no day-to-day involvement in running the businesses. But he did not divest — he retained majority ownership and installed his adult offspring in oversight positions, much as Mr. Trump has suggested he will do.\n",
      "A result was an unending series of scandals, even as Mr. Berlusconi’s businesses profited and the size of his personal fortune soared, reaching $12 billion by 2005, according to an estimate by Forbes magazine, considered the most reliable guide to the world’s wealthiest people. (Berlusconi’s wealth has declined significantly since he left office. Forbes estimates his current net worth at $5.6 billion.)\n",
      "“There were so many scandals with Berlusconi that it’s hard to know where to begin,” said Alexander Stille, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School and author of “The Sack of Rome,” a critical look at Mr. Berlusconi’s entangled business and political fortunes. Mr. Stille pointed to a communications law that allowed the prime minister to maintain a virtual monopoly over private television in Italy.\n",
      "“That kind of thing happened all the time,” he said. “All sorts of provisions appeared to be tailor-made to fit the contours of his business empire.”\n",
      "“It’s unbelievable to us in Italy,” Mr. Pollicino said, “that we’d be comparing Berlusconi to an American president.”\n",
      "Norman Eisen, a lawyer and conflicts-of-interest specialist who advised the Obama administration and is now at the Brookings Institution, agreed. “It’s shocking that we’re even having a conversation comparing Trump to Berlusconi and his antecedent strongmen of Italy, a long line that runs all the way back to Caesar,” Mr. Eisen said. “I guess we’ll all be relieved if he turns out to be Berlusconi and not Mussolini.”\n",
      "Mr. Eisen said that anything is possible, though. “We’ll know when we see his actual plan to address the business conflicts,” he added. “That will tell us whether he’ll abuse and make a mockery of the office or do what every other modern president has done and put his assets in a blind trust or the equivalent.”\n",
      "A spokeswoman said Mr. Trump declined to comment for this column.\n",
      "Such an arrangement seemed to impose few restraints on Mr. Berlusconi. “Berlusconi said he had nothing to do with operating his business empire,” Mr. Stille said. “But then he’d meet with business figures like Rupert Murdoch and discuss business. There was very little separation.”\n",
      "And in his career Mr. Trump has shown more respect for the law than Mr. Berlusconi did. “Trump has pushed the legal envelope,” Mr. Eisen said. “Berlusconi broke right through it.”\n",
      "But many more of Mr. Berlusconi’s businesses are domestic than Mr. Trump’s, with relatively few interests that might be influenced by foreign governments. “Trump’s business interests are primarily international,” Mr. Eisen said. “In that sense Trump is more dangerous than Berlusconi.”\n",
      "To the dismay of many, the Italian electorate showed scant interest in any of Mr. Berlusconi’s blatant conflicts. He was elected three times despite the constant drumbeat of scandal. “None of these issues seemed to register with the Italian public,” Mr. Stille said. “It was incredibly depressing to those of us writing about it. Most Italians with limited experience outside Italy assumed this was somehow not exceptional. It was just the way the world worked.”\n",
      "Indeed, Mr. Pollicino said, Mr. Berlusconi’s resignation, in 2011, had “nothing to do with any of the scandals — it was because of Italy’s severe economic distress and investors’ loss of confidence in the Italian markets.”\n",
      "Like Mr. Berlusconi, Mr. Trump has said that voters were fully aware of his business activities and potential conflicts when they cast ballots for him, and that “only the crooked media makes this a big deal.”\n",
      "But the fact that Mr. Berlusconi largely got away with it does not mean Mr. Trump should look to him as a role model. “Berlusconi,” Mr. Eisen said, “was widely viewed internationally as the second-greatest Italian clown since Roberto Benigni,” the comic actor. “But Italy plays a vastly smaller role in the world order than the United States does. We can’t afford to have that here, and I don’t think the American public would stand for it.”\n",

      "So I set out this week to assess the size and scope of her fortune, not to invade her privacy but because she’s that all-too-rare commodity in the ranks of the ultrawealthy — a role model. Not only has she made her fortune largely through her own wits and imagination, but she also pays taxes and gives generously to charity. At a time of bitter disputes over rising income inequality, no one seems to resent Ms. Rowling’s runaway success.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“She struggled as a single mother,” he said. “Then, she created this amazing franchise. She had tremendous talent, and she’s reaping the rewards. People don’t mind that. What they resent is when chief executives get paid for failure.”\n",
      "Ms. Rowling has also been backed by some high-powered negotiating and marketing muscle — Scholastic, which published the Potter books; Warner Bros., the studio behind the Potter films and now the “Fantastic Beasts” franchise; and NBCUniversal, which opened the Wizarding World attractions at its theme parks. Neil Blair, a former Warner Bros. executive, has represented her and fiercely protected her interests since he founded the Blair Partnership, a literary agency, in 2011, with Ms. Rowling as his most prominent client. Mr. Blair did not respond to requests for comment.\n",
      "A close look at Ms. Rowling’s sources of income suggests that she’s worth more than $1 billion, even allowing for a large margin of error. I came up with the estimates by interviewing a range of publishing and entertainment executives and agents. Some of them have negotiated with Ms. Rowling’s representatives and knew what terms they were seeking. No one was willing to be identified because pretty much everyone hopes to do business with Ms. Rowling. “She’s a sacred cow,” one executive said.\n",
      "To start with the obvious, there’s the source of her wealth: The seven Harry Potter books have sold an estimated 450 million copies, with estimated total revenue of $7.7 billion. At a standard 15 percent author’s royalty, she would have earned $1.15 billion. These books continue to sell strongly years after they were first published.\n",
      "Ms. Rowling has presumably been able to negotiate better deals for her subsequent books, which include adult mysteries under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith, published by a Little Brown imprint, as well as numerous Potter spinoffs. These works probably contributed at least another $50 million.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The next four Potter films were far more lucrative, generating well over $4 billion in revenue. By then, she was one of the rare talents who probably had negotiated a deal providing her a percentage of a film’s gross revenue. At 10 percent, that’s another $400 million.\n",

      "She almost certainly, according to the people I spoke with, managed a similar deal for the “Fantastic Beasts” series. Even if the first film generates just $500 million in revenue, less than half the highest-grossing Potter films, that adds another $50 million to her fortune, bringing the film total to $700 million.\n",
      "NBCUniversal does not break out revenue from the Wizarding World attractions, but attendance has more than doubled since the first Harry Potter attraction opened in 2010. Last year, NBCUniversal’s parent, Comcast, said overall theme park revenue jumped more than 60 percent to $1.4 billion.\n",
      "If half of that comes from Wizarding World, and Ms. Rowling gets 2 percent, then her take last year would have been $14 million. Since 2010, when the first attraction opened, I’d estimate she has earned at least $30 million on ticket sales, which would bring her total theme park earnings to roughly $100 million.\n",
      "NBCUniversal also bought exclusive television rights to the eight Harry Potter films this summer in a deal valued at as much as $250 million. Ms. Rowling presumably received a large piece of that, at least $125 million. That replaced a deal with Disney estimated to have been worth $50 million or more to her.\n",
      "That brings her total estimated earnings from books, movies, theme parks and television to more than $2.2 billion. Assuming that she paid Britain’s top individual tax rate of 45 percent, she would have been left with $1.2 billion.\n",
      "Ms. Rowling also has other income. She did not write the play “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child” but no doubt earned a licensing fee and is a profit participant. Long-running hit shows can generate enormous income — the composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion.\n",

      "Whatever the precise size of her fortune, Ms. Rowling is enormously wealthy. In this postelection holiday season, maybe her self-made success is something everyone can feel warm about. “It’s not going to happen to everyone, but it’s an inspiration that if you work hard and have talent, really good things can happen,” Professor Kaplan said. “It’s kind of like her books: Good triumphs over evil.”\n",

      "If this seems, well, normal it is because this tawdry glimpse into the industry — with its powerful men and passed-around girls — is deeply embedded in its history, its lore and its very identity. It’s the old yet evergreen story of the dewy young woman who comes to Hollywood, does a screen test and maybe signs a contract. The company dyes her hair blonde, feeds her pills and puts her on a diet or under a plastic surgeon’s knife. The lucky ones become Marilyn Monroe (or the It Girl du jour); the luckier ones get out alive. Others remain passed-around girls. The old studio system is gone, but the attitude that exploitation is part of the price for being in the business — hey, it’s Hollywood — endures.\n",
      "One paradox of Mr. Weinstein’s career is that while he emerged in the independent film world in the 1980s — positioning his earlier company, Miramax Films, as the David to the mainstream’s Goliath — he helped build a media giant that came to resemble an old-fashioned Hollywood studio. In an age of drab bean counters, Miramax had moxie and mystique. Importantly, it had a stable of publicity-ready female stars like Ms. Paltrow and rock-star male auteurs, most notably a favorite of critics, Quentin Tarantino. Sure, Mr. Weinstein might sometimes swing at someone, literally, but in Harveywood misdeeds were soon overshadowed by box-office tallies and savvy public relations.\n",
      "Peter Biskind, a former editor at the film magazine Premiere, tried to investigate Mr. Weinstein back in 1991, but writes that Miramax threatened to pull its advertising, adding, “the next thing I knew, Harvey was writing columns for Premiere and I was his editor.” Over the years, Mr. Weinstein’s grip on soft-bellied entertainment news media remained firm partly because it was mutually advantageous. And, as he rose, he supported women who supported him. In 2007, he presented a Crystal Award — given by Women in Film — to Renée Zellweger, a star of Miramax titles like “Chicago.”\n",
      "Given the revelations about Mr. Weinstein, it may seem surprising that his companies also offered actual opportunities for women, including directors like Jane Campion (“The Piano”) and older actresses like Judi Dench (“Shakespeare in Love”). This wasn’t progressive; it was evidence of a shrewd embrace of old-studio-style product diversification. In some ways, it is because Mr. Weinstein and his brother, Bob Weinstein, released different kinds of movies and didn’t pour all their resources only into formulas — and male-driven superhero movies — that they gave women opportunities.\n",
      "Jenni Konner, the co-showrunner for the HBO series “Girls,” has said that the revelations about Mr. Weinstein are a tipping point: “This is the moment we look back on and say, ‘That’s when it all started to change.’” I hope she’s right. One problem is that the entertainment industry is extraordinarily forgiving of those who have made it a lot of money, as Mel Gibson can tell you. It might glance at the fallen comrade on the floor, but only so it can step over the body en route to the next meeting. And if that comrade somehow gets on his feet again, the industry will ask if he has a new project. This forgiveness is often ascribed to the familiar line that the only thing the business cares about is money.\n",
      "Money often serves as a rationale for some of the industry’s noxiousness, including its sexism and racism: We can’t hire women, blacks, etc., because they don’t sell. Outsiders tend to see the industry as liberal, and while insiders do promote progressive causes, the business hews to a fundamental conservatism. This conservatism shapes its story recycling, its exploitation of women (and men) and its preservation of a male-dominated, racially homogeneous system. Despite pressure, including from the likes of Ava DuVernay and Lena Dunham, the industry resists change. Those in power don’t see an upside in ceding it.\n",
      "I hope real change comes soon, especially for the women working in the industry who each day are forced to fight sexism just so that they can do their jobs. I hope change comes because the movies need new and different voices and visions, something other than deadening, damaging stereotypes and storybook clichés. And I hope change comes for those of us who love movies. I’ve spent a lifetime navigating the contradictions of that love, grappling with the pleasures movies offer with the misogyny that too often has informed what happened behind the camera and what is onscreen. The movies can break your heart, but this isn’t the time only for tears. It is also the time for rage.\n",

      "Opponents of the proposed AT&T purchase of Time Warner don’t want to just block the $85.4 billion deal: They want to overturn decades of antitrust policy and case law.\n",
      "Until recently, that would have been all but unthinkable. But in today’s superheated and politically charged environment, they may just succeed.\n",
      "Politicians were piling on this week to criticize the deal, including Donald J. Trump; Tim Kaine, the Democratic nominee for vice president; and Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota. Still to be heard from is Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a prominent foe of corporate consolidation.\n",
      "A younger generation of antitrust scholars who are rethinking the nation’s fundamental approach to antitrust law may prove even more influential.\n",
      "In vertical mergers, a company buys a supplier; in horizontal mergers, direct competitors combine.\n",
      "But the new generation harks back to the original trustbusters of the early 20th century, who were most concerned about preventing corporations from gaining too much power.\n",
      "“The antitrust system as it stands is focused on prices to consumers, innovation and efficiencies,” Mr. Wu said. “That reflects the triumph of the University of Chicago school of economics. But there’s an older tradition, embodied by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis, that says a concentration of too much power in too few hands is bad for democracy and bad for consumers.”\n",
      "Scott Hemphill, an antitrust and intellectual property professor at New York University School of Law, agreed. “Vertical deals rarely get prohibited outright,” he said. “Modern antitrust case law has pretty much kept politics out of the analysis.”\n",
      "“But is antitrust law only about economics, or does enhanced political power play a role?” Mr. Hemphill asked. “Would a combined AT&T and Time Warner put too much power in one company? That’s the big question.”\n",
      "It’s a question AT&T says it is prepared to answer. “If someone is looking for a test case to overturn the time-honored judicial precedents of vertical mergers, this is not the case,” David R. McAtee II, AT&T’s general counsel, told me this week. “What we have here is a classic vertical merger that will benefit consumers in an environment that’s begging for innovation.”\n",
      "Given antitrust precedents, it’s no wonder AT&T and Time Warner would expect regulatory approval, even if they have to accept some conditions imposed by the government. Time Warner is so confident the deal will be approved that it negotiated a paltry breakup fee (by megamerger standards) in the event it’s blocked: just $500 million.\n",
      "At nearly every opportunity, Randall L. Stephenson, AT&T’s chief executive, and other architects of the deal have repeated the “vertical” mantra. As Mr. Stephenson told me this weekend, “This is strictly a vertical merger. We’re combining with one of our big suppliers. You’d be hard pressed to find a vertical merger denied by the regulators. They won’t give us a free pass, but we expect that if they have concerns, they’ll impose conditions to address them.”\n",
      "Mr. Stephenson is right about that. Time Warner is just one of many content suppliers to AT&T, albeit an important one. Time Warner competes vigorously with other film and television studios, cable networks, and producers of news and entertainment.\n",
      "AT&T, once known informally as Ma Bell, is a storied American brand that goes back under a succession of names to the late 19th century, after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.\n",
      "AT&T competes in cable delivery systems, satellite and wireless. While more concentrated than news and entertainment (there are just four major wireless carriers), they are still competitive markets.\n",
      "This isn’t a “horizontal” American Airlines-US Airways merger (which inexplicably passed antitrust review) or even the earlier 21st Century Fox bid, which Time Warner rebuffed in part because of antitrust concerns.\n",
      "Since neither firm competes with the other one, merging the two would have little or no effect on market concentration. And the deal’s architects are promising a bevy of virtues for consumers, from more wireless video access to lower prices.\n",
      "Case closed?\n",
      "Thanks in large part to groundbreaking books in the 1970s by the Supreme Court nominee and Yale Law School antitrust scholar Robert Bork (“The Antitrust Paradox”) and Richard Posner (now an influential judge on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals) at the University of Chicago Law School (“Antitrust Law”), vertical mergers came to be viewed as usually promoting competition and, by extension, consumer welfare.\n",
      "The view was embraced by the Supreme Court and embedded in the Justice Department’s vertical merger guidelines during the Reagan administration.\n",
      "The proposed Comcast-NBC Universal deal set off an avalanche of criticism from rival media companies and consumer advocates who argued that it consolidated too much power in one company. In 2011 the Justice Department sued to block the deal on grounds it had the potential to disadvantage competitors that delivered video services, such as satellite broadcasters and telecom companies, and emerging online video providers like Netflix.\n",
      "In an opinion that has no doubt been closely scrutinized by AT&T’s antitrust lawyers at Arnold & Porter, a federal judge ruled that the conditions Comcast accepted to ease the regulator’s concerns “will provide a prompt, certain and effective remedy for consumers by diminishing Comcast’s ability” to “harm competition.”\n",
      "Whether that has indeed been the case will no doubt be the subject of intense scrutiny by regulators. “It’s important to assess how well the NBC consent decree has done,” Mr. Hemphill said. “On the face of things, online video seems to be thriving. But has Comcast engaged in troubling behavior as a result of owning NBCUniversal? That’s an important question for thinking about this deal.”\n",
      "Susan P. Crawford, a professor at Harvard Law School and author of “Captive Audience: The Telecom Industry and Monopoly Power in the New Gilded Age,” was an influential voice in encouraging regulators to oppose the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. She predicted the same fate for AT&T-Time Warner.\n",
      "“I think this is unlikely to be approved,” she said. “There were very few public benefits to the Comcast/NBCU deal, which should not have gone through. It’s difficult even to identify a public benefit for this one.”\n",
      "Mr. McAtee of AT&T said it would “be fundamentally inconsistent and unfair” for the government to reject AT&T’s deal for Time Warner after it approved the Comcast NBC Universal merger.\n",
      "“We feel we have an even stronger case,” he added. “Comcast was a dominant, entrenched cable and broadband provider, and NBC Universal had big broadcast licenses in an ecosystem where over-the-top video was still in its infancy. Yet the government approved the deal with conditions. On all counts, we have a stronger case for approval.”\n",
      "AT&T and Time Warner executives will have many months to make their argument to consumers, Congress, regulators and the White House. But there’s a risk they will find themselves in the midst of a revolution in antitrust thinking that transcends any one case.\n",
      "“It’s interesting that both presidential candidates have said they’d take a close look at this,” Mr. Wu said. “So one of the first tests for the new president will be where they come down on this: Will it be Louis Brandeis or the University of Chicago?”\n",

      "In recent decades, American public discourse has become hollow and shrill. Instead of morally robust debates about the common good, we have shouting matches on talk radio and cable television, and partisan food fights in Congress. People argue past one another, without really listening or seeking to persuade.\n",
      "This condition has diminished the public’s regard for political parties and politicians, and also given rise to a danger: A politics empty of moral argument creates a vacuum of meaning that is often filled by the vengeful certitudes of strident nationalism. This danger now hovers over American politics. More than a year into the presidency of Donald Trump, however, liberals and progressives have yet to articulate a politics of the common good adequate to the country’s predicament.\n",
      "Reich’s book diagnoses the decline of the common good in American life and suggests ways of restoring it. He begins by observing that even the term has fallen into disuse: “The common good is no longer a fashionable idea. The phrase is rarely uttered today, not even by commencement speakers and politicians.”\n",
      "Reich defines the common good as consisting in “our shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound together in the same society.” What binds us as Americans, he argues, is not birth or ethnicity but a commitment to fundamental ideals and principles: respect for the rule of law and democratic institutions, toleration of our differences and belief in equal political rights and equal opportunity.\n",
      "Reich attributes the erosion of the common good in recent decades to the breakdown of moral restraint in the pursuit of power and money. In Washington, the “whatever-it-takes-to-win politics” that began in the Nixon years has led to the hyperpartisanship of today. In the corporate world, the single-minded pursuit of shareholder value has displaced the older notion that companies are responsible for the well-being of workers, customers and the communities they serve.\n",
      "The unbridled pursuit of power and profit has brought an enormous flow of corporate money into politics. The result is a rigged system that perpetuates inequality, enables economic elites to manipulate the rules of the game to their own advantage, undermines trust in institutions and promotes attitudes of unrestrained self-seeking in social life generally.\n",
      "There are several ways to revive the common good, Reich suggests. One is to recover the notion of leadership as trusteeship. Corporate executives should recognize responsibilities beyond maximizing profits, and public officials should resist the scorched-earth, anything-goes approach to politics. The essence of Trump’s failure as a leader, according to Reich, is “not that he has chosen one set of policies over another, or has divided rather than united Americans, or even that he has behaved in childish and vindictive ways unbecoming a president. It is that he has sacrificed the processes and institutions of American democracy to achieve his goals.”\n",
      "Reich also calls for a greater emphasis on civic education, including two years of mandatory public service, and efforts to resurrect truth from the miasma of political deceit and fake news. Perhaps the most distinctive measure Reich proposes is the redeployment of honor and shame. Rather than honor people for their wealth or celebrity, we should honor those who display genuine virtue, like whistle-blowers, firefighters, social workers and soldiers — people who perform hard or risky tasks that serve the common good. And we should shame those who, however wealthy, achieve their status through exploitative business practices or morally dubious financial dealings.\n",
      "Against the grain of much liberal thinking, Reich acknowledges that promoting civic virtue requires being judgmental about what moral attitudes and qualities of character our public life should affirm and promote. This recognition of the role of moral judgment in politics is an important corrective to the liberal wariness of bringing morality into the public square.\n",
      "Reich’s proposals would make a good starting point for a new progressive political project. What is puzzling, however, is his insistence that a politics of the common good can or should be nonpartisan. Time and again, he draws a sharp distinction between the common good he wants to revive and the competing conceptions of the common good at stake in everyday political debate — about tax policy, health care, the environment and so on. He insists his book is not about what messages Democrats or Republicans should convey or what policies they should pursue, but rather about restoring our shared commitment to democratic norms and principles. “It’s our agreement to these principles that connects us, not agreement about where these principles lead.”\n",
      "As these examples suggest, the nonpartisan, above-the-fray conception of the common good that Reich proposes may be too high-minded to reinvigorate American public discourse in the way he wants. In the face of President Trump’s serial violations of democratic norms, it is tempting to appeal to Americans, whatever their party or political persuasion, to reaffirm certain principles that all can share. But such principles, if truly detached from debate about where they lead, are so abstract that they can only serve as hortatory fare for commencement addresses and the Fourth of July. The best hope for reviving the common good is to invigorate moral argument in the messy, contentious domain of democratic politics.\n",

      "In the 1950s, when women were relegated to housework, Stringfield revved and roared through Florida’s palm-tree-lined streets on her Harley-Davidson.\n",
      "Somewhere between myth, memory and motorcycles, Bessie B. Stringfield was great.\n",
      "In the 1950s, when women were relegated to housework, either in marriage or as domestics, Stringfield was married several times and worked as a maid yet revved and roared through Florida’s palm-tree-lined streets on her Harley-Davidson, earning the unofficial title of “Motorcycle Queen of Miami.”\n",
      "Robert Scott Thomas, now 72, was a little boy when Stringfield worked as a housekeeper for his family. He recalled thinking her stories were unbelievable, but said, “I don’t think she ever told me a lie. It was the dead-nuts right.”\n",
      "Thomas was named the beneficiary and the executor of her estate in her will; after all, she apparently had no survivors.\n",
      "From a nursing home in Baltimore, Esther Bennett, 86, had a different version. “She lied. Her mother’s name was Maggie Cherry. Her father was James White.”\n",
      "They were both black American and lived in Edenton, N.C., according to Bennett, Stringfield’s niece. Records confirmed her account.\n",
      "“I don’t know anything about Jamaican. She was never adopted,” Bennett said.\n",
      "She did not know how Bessie Beatrice White Stringfield, small-town Southerner, came to be Bessie B. Stringfield, big-city Jamaican.\n",
      "In Stringfield’s tales, she always came out on top by proving herself or by finding common ground. She told people that she won over a white Miami police officer by demonstrating her riding skills. She told people that she was followed through back roads by an angry white mob, yet she outran them and then found a kind white gas station owner who allowed her to fill up her tank free. There was also folklore passed from one generation of relatives to the next that Stringfield had worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and perhaps, she had disappeared to protect them.\n",
      "The stories were outrageous enough to ring true. Only Stringfield knew if they really were.\n",
      "Ferrar had passed on some of the misinformation of Stringfield’s early life, wanting to keep her legacy alive. Asked recently about these untruths, Ferrar wrote in an email, “Bessie’s running from her early past does not discount or in any way lessen her unusual achievements as an adult, and that is why Bessie continues to inspire new generations, and rightfully so.”\n",
      "“She asked me to tell her truth as her friend,” Ferrar said in an interview.\n",
      "Her lasting power was in her presence, especially in the eyes of children, during a period when seeing a black woman commanding a Harley-Davidson was unprecedented.\n",
      "Bennett and her brothers remembered how their aunt would whirl in and out of Baltimore where they lived. Their mother was Mary Louise White Skinner, one of Stringfield’s older sisters. They described their aunt as worldly and wily.\n",
      "“I was knee high to a duck. She would never tell nobody what her business was,” said Robert Irving Skinner, 74, a nephew.\n",
      "David Skinner, 76, another nephew, said their mother would yell at Stringfield, “Get those boys off that bike!”\n",
      "“She would stand up on that bike with one foot on the seat and one foot on the handlebars,” he said, laughing in a phone interview.\n",
      "Bennett was once so rattled by a ride with Stringfield that she refused to get back on. “She jumped the track. I took a car back. She gave me car fare.”\n",
      "Motorcycle riding was unladylike by societal norms in the early 20th century, and the family elders did not approve, said Jackie Reid, 70, the daughter of one of Stringfield’s half sisters, who added that they were also worried about her safety.\n",
      "There was an argument in the 1950s that the children were not privy to, and Stringfield did not visit again.\n",
      "“The last they heard from her was she was in Florida,” Reid said. “She was a wanderer.”\n",
      "Marriage records show Stringfield spent some time in Indiana. And 1945 census records show that she claimed Massachusetts as her birthplace, but she also said she had been born around 1918.\n",
      "In the 1950s, she finally settled down in Miami, first working as a domestic and later becoming a certified nursing assistant.\n",
      "She befriended the families that employed her, making an outsized impression on Robert Scott Thomas and Tom Thomas, who were in elementary school in the early 1950s.\n",
      "Their mother, delayed or forgetful, failed to pick them up from school one day, so Stringfield came to the rescue. “We found Bessie out there on her Harley and in her leather jacket,” said Tom Thomas, 70.\n",
      "Both jumped on the motorcycle with her. “I was just a little kid so I was only wrapped around half of her,” Robert Scott Thomas said. “I could feel the heat from the exhaust on my leg.”\n",
      "“All the kids were going crazy,” he said.\n",
      "Bea Hines, a columnist at The Miami Herald, wrote a profile of Stringfield in 1981. She made for a colorful interview, sharing her feats and her preference for men many years her junior. She claimed to have married six of them.\n",
      "Hines also had a personal connection, remembering how Stringfield would lead a pack of motorcyclists, all men, in an annual parade. “I can remember being in awe of this beautiful black woman with this big bushy hair under her helmet,” she said.\n",

      "Yet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January, after publication of the Michael Wolff tell-all, “Fire and Fury,” the president had to publicly defend himself as a “stable genius.”\n",
      "And that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations, or the announcement on Wednesday by the White House communications director Hope Hicks — the fourth person to hold the job — that she, too, was leaving.\n",

      "With over a full year under Mr. Trump’s belt, and his unorthodox management style fully in evidence, I asked several experts to assess the president’s abilities as a manager.\n",
      "“It’s much worse than I expected,” said Jeffrey Pfeffer, professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and the author of “Power: Why Some People Have It and Others Don’t.”\n",
      "“The most important thing you need as a chief executive is the ability to hire and retain talent,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Trump said he’d get all these great people to work for him. But the rate of departures is unprecedented. Either he hired badly, or he hired well but couldn’t retain them. Either way, this reflects badly on his leadership.”\n",
      "As Jeffrey T. Polzer, professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School, told me last year, the time-tested approach is “to surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise, who bring different perspectives to the issue at hand.”\n",
      "“Then you foster debate and invite different points of view in order to reach a high-quality solution,” Mr. Polzer said.\n",
      "He added that it “requires an openness to being challenged, and some self-awareness and even humility to acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you do.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump does appear to solicit and consider the opinions of others, but they are as likely to be random guests at Mar-a-Lago, or television pundits, as they are experts in the field, or even his own appointees.\n",

      "“The lack of attention to data drives me nuts,” Mr. Pfeffer said. Mr. Trump, he said, “seems to have no interest in science, social science or data,” citing White House initiatives to repeal Obamacare and to rescue the coal industry as glaring examples.\n",
      "Others pointed to his threats to pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with little understanding of the consequences for American businesses and farmers, and his decision to abandon the Paris climate accord despite scant familiarity with the science of climate change.\n",

      "Yet despite the well-documented disarray prevailing in the West Wing, Mr. Trump’s first year has yielded some major accomplishments: business-friendly tax legislation, the appointment of a reliably conservative Supreme Court justice in Neil Gorsuch, the selection of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the dismantling of a regulatory regime viewed as overly burdensome by the business community.\n",
      "“You have to hand it to him: He has pulled some rabbits out of his hat,” Mr. Elson said. “Hardly anyone thought he could pull off tax legislation after so many other people had tried and failed.”\n",
      "But Mr. Pfeffer said those achievements had occurred despite the chaos, not because of it. For every success, Mr. Trump has had notable failures, starting with overhauling immigration policy and repealing Obamacare.\n",
      "“I’ve long felt that if Trump didn’t do well, it would be because of organizational issues,” Mr. Pfeffer said. “Even with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress, he hasn’t been able to pass much. That speaks to chaos in the policy sphere.”\n",
      "Mr. Elson said Mr. Trump acted more like the typical entrepreneur than an experienced manager. “A problem with entrepreneurs is that people get tired of it and they move on,” he said. “People just get worn out. At some point you need a real manager. A lot of entrepreneurs sell their businesses when they reach a certain size and they realize they can’t manage them.”\n",

      "Would naming Mr. Cohn as chief of staff ameliorate the problem? Despite disenchantment with Mr. Kelly and his handling of the Porter situation, no one I interviewed thinks Mr. Cohn could fundamentally change the dynamic in the Trump White House any more than Mr. Kelly has.\n",
      "Mr. Cohn is now basking in the afterglow of the tax legislation, which seems to be growing in popularity with the public. His supporters point to the first-rate team he assembled at the National Economic Council as evidence that he — perhaps alone among top White House officials — could attract and retain talent. He enjoys good relations with Congress.\n",
      "But if Mr. Cohn became Mr. Trump’s chief of staff, he would have to sublimate his own beliefs to the president’s agenda. As one former White House official told me, “He can’t pull another Charlottesville,” referring to Mr. Cohn’s efforts last summer to publicly distance himself from the president’s racially charged comments while still working for him.\n",
      "Thanks to that incident, Mr. Cohn has already fallen from favor once, and his current rehabilitation may not last. People like Mr. Trump “have friends for a day,” Mr. Elson said. “That’s another quality of the entrepreneur. Like it or not, it’s part of what makes them successful.”\n",
      "While Mr. Cohn has influential supporters at the White House, talk of his possible elevation has prompted plenty of opposition, too, especially from representatives of Mr. Trump’s populist base. Mr. Cohn is, after all, a longtime Manhattan Democrat.\n",

      "In any event, Mr. Trump may be oblivious to the staff turnover and widespread vacancies in the executive branch, and indifferent to calls to replace Mr. Kelly.\n",

      "The rush to enact the tax bill was designed to mask — as a break for the middle class — what is in fact a $1.4 trillion package of benefits for key donors and lobbyists, the richest members of Congress, President Trump, his family and other families like his.\n",
      "The authors cite a wide range of specific flaws, but their main argument is that the measure is gravely deficient at its core:\n",
      "The most serious structural problems with the bill are unavoidable outcomes of Congress’s choice to preference certain taxpayers and activities while disfavoring others — and for no discernible policy rationale. These haphazard lines are fundamentally unfair and inefficient, and invite tax planning by sophisticated taxpayers to get within the preferred categories.\n",
      "Glogower, Kamin, Kysar, and Shanske argue that some of the most egregious loopholes and schemes permitted by the legislation are that individual taxpayers\n",
      "will be able to shield their labor income from tax by simply setting up a corporation and having their income accrue in the form of corporate profits. As a result, income that would have been taxed at the high individual rates is instead taxed at the low corporate rate.\n",
      "Second, the legislation creates a huge incentive for anyone in a position to do so to change his or her status from employee to “independent contractor or a partner in a firm. The game is clear: Don’t be an employee, instead be an independent contractor or partner in a firm.” The ability to make this shift is available primarily to the well-paid.\n",
      "The legislation, according to Glogower and his colleagues, also fails to present a coherent rationale:\n",
      "the fundamental problem is the lack of any underlying logic in deciding who benefits from the pass-through deductions, and who does not. Independent contractors and partners benefit, but not employees. Why? An owner of real estate through a REIT benefits, but not the doctor in the building. Why? An architect benefits in some ways that a lawyer does not. And so on.\n",
      "The bill encourages tax evasion. Glogower and his colleagues cite\n",
      "opportunities to use rate differentials and ill-considered transitions to engage in transactions that serve to basically pump money out of the Treasury and into the pockets of well-advised taxpayers.\n",
      "To provide an example, they use a company that purchased equipment under existing law, which provides them with tax breaks on the cost spread out over the years in a depreciation schedule. The new law allows companies to immediately write off the full cost of buying equipment, known as expensing.\n",
      "“So,” the authors ask, “what does that mean?”\n",
      "It means that old property can still get the benefit of expensing, but only if it is sold to another party. If the original owner holds it, they have to depreciate according to the old rules; if they sell it to another party, then suddenly the full cost is eligible for expensing, and the net effect is an immediate deduction of the existing tax basis of the asset. The parties can split the resulting surplus. It appears that the buyer of the asset could even lease it back to the existing owner, so that the property doesn’t even have to go anywhere.\n",
      "I emailed some of the authors of this report for their individual thoughts.\n",
      "Mitchell Kane, a law professor at N.Y.U., wrote in response that the bill will\n",

      "lower and middle-income families, who are especially dependent upon inflation-indexed deductions, credits, and bracket thresholds, will feel the impact increasingly as time goes on.\n",
      "In the first year, 2018, the changed inflation rate raises a relatively modest $31.5 billion but it grows every year, reaching $37 billion in 2027. “To be sure,” Hemel wrote, “this affects everyone to some degree, but most of the burden is paid for by families in the bottom four quintiles.”\n",
      "In the long term, Hemel argued,\n",
      "this is a very subtle way to increase taxes on the lower and middle classes and then use those revenues to pay for a massive tax cut for corporations.\n",
      "This full-speed-ahead strategy simultaneously constrained the ability of the press to explore the special interest provisions buried in the legislation.\n",
      "A tax expert who insisted on anonymity in order to protect client confidentiality, emailed me his critique of the bill:\n",
      "(1) The corporate rate reduction is permanent, for individuals only temporary. Completely obnoxious. In effect the money “saved” within the 10 year budget window by making those individual cuts temporary helped to underwrite the cost of making the corporate/pass though side permanent\n",
      "(2) Carried interest provision. When Trump was careening around in his populist candidate mode, he promised to end it. Here is one campaign promise that he “somehow” failed to redeem when the clear and available chance presented itself.\n",
      "(3) Restriction on state and C local tax deduction — consciously vindictive imposition of double taxation on citizens of certain Democratic states; corporations and pass through businesses, the darlings of the Republicans, still get to deduct those very same taxes in full.\n",
      "(4) Expanding the standard deduction but financing the cost of so doing by repealing the personal exemptions is a bit of a bait and switch maneuver. Some people might be worse off.\n",
      "(5) In a bill in which 100s of billions of dollars were sloshing around to provide steep tax cuts for already wealthy and highly prosperous corporations and pass through businesses, the Republicans could only find the will to raise the refundable portion of the child care tax credit from $1000 to $1400. Rubio wanted it to be raised to $2000 and his Republican brethren refused to even meet him halfway. Pitiful.\n",
      "(6) Deduction for extraordinary medical expenses — retention of this deduction did not even get the five-year sunset window applied to all the other individual tax provisions, two years only. Vicious.\n",
      "(7) Pass through business taxation — the bill is a massive tax gift to some of the wealthiest people in the country, who are conducting business operations in non-corporate form or are investors in same.\n",
      "What amounted to three major pieces of legislation were approved by the full House and the Senate Finance Committee, “two weeks after the bill was unveiled, without a single hearing on the 400-plus-page legislation,” as Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport put it in The Times.\n",
      "One of our jobs is to flesh out competing views with such seriousness and respect that we should be mitigating, not exacerbating, the polarization that does exist ...\n",
      "Good teachers don’t shut down debate; they try to model Socratic seriousness by putting the best possible construction on arguments, even — and especially — if one doesn’t hold those positions.\n",
      "for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts. We won’t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions.\n",
      "So far, however, only one Republican senator has suffered real costs for deciding to vote for the tax bill.\n",
      "No way that Bob Corker is going to vote for a tax reform bill that I think in any way is going to add to the deficit. It’s not going to happen, never. It’s never going to happen. Never, never, ever.\n",
      "This is the most passionate thing for me, period, that I work on. Not foreign policy. Not banking. It’s this deficit issue.\n",
      "For Corker, this issue went way beyond routine politics: “Deficits matter,” he forcefully asserted. “They are a greater threat to us than North Korea or ISIS.”\n",
      "In the end, after 11 years in the Senate, I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation. I think we are better off with it.\n",
      "All of this raises a basic question. How could nearly every Republican representative — and all 52 Republican senators — support the tax bill? The best answer may be the most cynical: because it benefits key leaders, their friends, their heirs and their donors.\n",
      "After looking at the legislation in its entirety — its substance and the procedures used to get there — it is difficult to conclude that the motivations of its sponsors are either benevolent or somehow in the best interests of the country. More likely it is hypocrisy and venality mixed up into one awful bill.\n",

      "It’s official: Returns for college and university endowments for the 2017 fiscal year are in, and while they averaged a respectable 12.2 percent for the year, over the last decade they have underperformed funds offering a simple 60-40 or 70-30 stock-fixed income allocation.\n",
      "With their average returns dragged down by the weak performance of hedge funds, venture capital and private equity, you would think endowments would be fleeing these so-called alternative investments, which are costly and mostly illiquid, as some large pension funds have done.\n",
      "On the contrary, endowments are holding firm, or even adding to these holdings. Last year, alternative investments accounted for an average of 52 percent of endowment assets — over 60 percent in the largest endowments — the same percentage as two years ago, according to the annual Nacubo-Commonfund study of endowments.\n",
      "Yet over the last 10 years, the average endowment earned a 4.6 percent annualized return, lower than the 5.3 percent return for a low-cost 60-40 stock-bond index fund portfolio and 5.4 percent for a 70-30 mix.\n",
      "For endowments greater than $1 billion, the average return was 5 percent. Had they realized that extra three-tenths of a percent, or 30 basis points, that the 60-40 portfolio delivered, they’d have on average an additional $47 million in their endowments.\n",
      "The trend is likely to be even more pronounced next year, when the financial crisis results of the 2009 fiscal year drop out of the 10-year calculations. That’s because alternatives did provide something of a buffer during that severe bear market, but have mostly underperformed since.\n",
      "Five-year averages suggest the magnitude of the gap: The average endowment had annualized five-year returns of 5.9 percent. A 60-40 mix returned 8.2 percent, and a 70-30 mix returned 9.2.\n",
      "“That’s tens of millions of dollars that could have otherwise funded scholarships, built a new museum wing or bolster the corpus of the endowment to help future generations,” said Christopher Philips, head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services. (He’s not a disinterested observer: Vanguard is a major purveyor of — and advocate for — low-cost index and mutual funds.)\n",
      "“It’s frustrating because these institutions do so much good work, and most of them could be doing so much better,” Mr. Philips said.\n",
      "Even Yale University, which pioneered the so-called Yale Model now slavishly followed by many other endowments, and has a target allocation of nearly 90 percent of its assets in alternative assets, has seen its outperformance shrink in recent years. Yale delivered an 11.3 percent return for 2017, but that was below the average return for all endowments of 12.2 percent, according to the study by Nacubo, the National Association of College and University Business Officers.\n",
      "Yale still boasts a stellar 20-year annualized return of 12.1 percent, far above the endowment 20-year average of 7.4 percent, according to the university. But its 10-year annualized return has slipped to just 6.6 percent. (That still puts it in the top 5 percent of all endowment returns.) Still, Yale told me that its chief investment officer, David Swensen, is bullish on the school’s portfolio relative to stocks and bonds for the next 10 years.\n",
      "The endowments’ persistent devotion to high-cost alternative assets in the face of such poor performance, now documented across a decade-long span, baffles many. “We keep scratching our heads,” Mr. Philips of Vanguard said.\n",
      "“Among the schools we survey, there’s a strong belief in the endowment model pioneered 30 years or so ago by Yale and a few other schools,” said Kenneth E. Redd, senior director of research and policy analysis for Nacubo. “We’re not seeing any changes in portfolio alignment or investment philosophy even though the indexes have clearly outperformed both managed funds and hedge funds. There’s still this belief that alternatives will provide some measure of outperformance.”\n",
      "He noted that endowments of more than $1 billion, which tend to have high allocations to alternatives, did on average outperform the 60-40 mix (but not the 70-30 mix) over the most recent five-year period.\n",
      "Jeff Schwartz, Markov’s president, agreed. “We’re talking about true believers in the value of alternatives,” he said. Many endowment managers, he added, “aren’t completely objective.”\n",
      "“They’ve seen it work in the past, sometimes in a spectacular way,” he continued. “It’s hard to take an embedded belief system like that and say, just because we’ve had an outstanding bull market, that you should move to 60-40. That’s a tall order.”\n",
      "Given the need to cover increased costs, not to mention the recent tax legislation that seeks to tax the wealthiest endowments, asset managers at colleges are under increasing pressure to generate higher returns, even as lofty stock valuations and rising interest rates “suggest it will be hard to get 7.5 percent with a traditional asset mix going forward,” Mr. Philips said.\n",
      "“So there’s a strong inclination to turn to something that promises higher returns,” he said, even if they haven’t delivered in the recent past.\n",
      "He also pointed to the “massive marketing machine in the alternative space,” which is “causing investment managers to turn a blind eye to what’s really happening in financial markets.”\n",
      "Universities depend heavily on draws from their endowments — typically 5 percent or more per year — to meet spending needs, and are still haunted by memories of the financial crisis. This month’s stock market volatility was a painful reminder.\n",
      "So the promise of alternative investments to mitigate risk and protect against market downturns has been powerful, even if they haven’t delivered.\n",
      "But with long-term — even infinite — time horizons, university endowments should be able to withstand market volatility.\n",
      "“We’re aware of the need to support current spending,” Mr. Philips said, “but if growing the corpus to support future spending is a primary objective, there should be more traditional equity exposure, not less. Adding nontraditional assets would be O.K. if they were compensating for illiquidity and higher risk, but they’re not.”\n",

      "But France, Britain and Germany aim to present to the White House a separate political agreement that commits to taking a tougher stance on Iran if they can agree it in time with the U.S. State Department, their American interlocutors.\n",

      "That would incorporate the existing nuclear deal and the issues currently discussed between Europeans and Americans. But it is hard to see how Iran could be brought back to the table. Tehran says it is abiding by the terms of the 2015 deal and has no intention to renegotiate it.\n",

      "Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and stock market, but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J. Trump, as he did again during this week’s State of the Union address. Among the highlights:\n",
      "• “$8 trillion and more” in stock market gains.\n",
      "• “2.4 million new jobs” created since his election.\n",
      "• “Over 3 million workers have gotten tax-cut bonuses” and “rising wages.”\n",
      "• All thanks to “the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history.”\n",
      "Since the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this, I thought it only fair to assess the degree to which the undeniably strong economy, low unemployment and surging stock market are because of Mr. Trump’s achievements, notably his sweeping tax bill.\n",
      "It turns out that’s no easy task, especially since Mr. Trump has only been president for a year, and the tax legislation is little more than a month old. Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagan’s 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passage.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "With that in mind, here’s a look at the major areas where Mr. Trump claims credit.\n",
      "The S.&P. 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year in office, an increase surpassed only by Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama, both Democrats who took office in the wake of financial crises and stock market crashes. Mr. Trump’s policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit, given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes to raise company earnings, and stock prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectations.\n",
      "“There’s no question after-tax earnings will be higher” thanks to the tax legislation, Professor Slemrod said.\n",
      "But the estimated impact on after-tax earnings — a range of 7 to 10 percent, according to most economists — accounts for less than half the stock market’s rise over the past year. The rest is because of other factors, which may include Mr. Trump’s pro-business outlook, but also many things beyond his control.\n",
      "Stock market valuations are reaching lofty levels by many measures, and those gains may prove ephemeral if growth doesn’t live up to investors’ rosy expectations. “The value of the stock market isn’t an indicator of the economic health of America,” Professor Slemrod noted.\n",
      "Gross domestic product grew by 2.3 percent last year, lower than Mr. Trump’s predictions of 3-plus percent, but significantly better than the 1.6 percent growth in 2016, Mr. Obama’s last year in office.\n",
      "As should be obvious, passage of the Republican tax legislation was too recent to have had any impact on those numbers. To the extent that expectations of tax reform fueled investment decisions, they may have had some effect, but that’s nearly impossible to measure.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The first real clues will come next year, when 2018 gross domestic product numbers are released. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new tax legislation would raise G.D.P. by seven-tenths of a percent over what it would have been under the old law.\n",
      "“The economy has been strong, and forecasts for next year have been bumped up due to the tax cut, ” said Professor Auerbach. “But there’s a lot going on. You won’t be able to tell what the impact is from just a few quarters.”\n",
      "Even 10 years after the 1986 law, “it was very difficult to tease out the impact of tax reform on the economy,” he said. “The best estimate is it didn’t have much effect.”\n",
      "Professor Slemrod agreed. “Tax policy might not be as critical to the rate of business investment as had been thought,” he said.\n",
      "Still, if United States economic growth hits Chinese levels of 7 percent a year or more, which Mr. Trump repeatedly has said is attainable, then Republicans will have a “much stronger” basis for claiming credit for it, Professor Slemrod said. But he deemed such an outcome “extraordinarily unlikely.”\n",
      "The tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers, including at least 40 members of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, to pass on savings to workers.\n",
      "Many companies have been doling out bonuses to employees since the tax legislation passed, but “I don’t think that tells us anything,” Professor Slemrod said. That’s because in standard economic theory, labor market conditions dictate employee compensation levels, not cash flow or profitability.\n",
      "“The labor market was strengthening long before Mr. Trump was elected or the tax bill was passed,” Professor Slemrod said. “If companies were going to raise wages anyway to stay competitive, they have a public relations incentive to attribute it to tax cuts.”\n",
      "Wage growth actually slowed during the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency compared with the last year of Mr. Obama’s.\n",

      "Mr. Auerbach added that given the length of the recovery and low levels of unemployment, many economists “have been wondering why we haven’t seen stronger wage growth” as competition for labor heats up. “Now we may be starting to see it.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Much the same can be said about unemployment, which fell to 4.1 percent from 4.7 percent during Mr. Trump’s first year as president, and which also reflects the tight labor market conditions that have been developing for years. The unemployment rate fell much more during the Obama years (three full percentage points, from when Mr. Obama took office until when he left), which would be expected given the severe recession he inherited.\n",
      "In any event, it’s far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump’s impact on the labor market. Economists generally agree that at least some of the Republican tax cuts will flow through to workers, although there are widely differing projections about how much, and most say the largest share will go to shareholders in the form of dividends, stock buybacks and higher share prices. Professor Slemrod said we may never know for sure, but “in five or six years we may be able to tell if some of the more extreme claims are reasonable.”\n",
      "Unlike the 1986 tax legislation, which claimed to be revenue-neutral, the latest Republican bill is a huge tax cut. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new law would add just over $1 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. It predicted higher interest rates as a result, which it estimated would cost the Treasury an additional $66 billion in debt service costs.\n",
      "Some supporters of the tax law contend that economic growth will come so quickly that increased tax revenue will more than make up for the cuts. The actual impact on the deficit won’t be evident for at least a year, but the rising deficits that followed tax cuts in 1981 forced Republicans to raise taxes in both 1982 and 1984.\n",
      "Interest rates are already trending higher. Both Professors Auerbach and Slemrod agreed that rates are likely to rise further and would be an important measure of the impact of the tax legislation and Mr. Trump’s economic policies. If they rise faster than at the cautious pace the Federal Reserve has projected and investors expect, that could bring the stock market rally to an abrupt end. Higher-than-expected rates could also slow the economy, or even tip it into recession.\n",
      "How sensitive the stock market is to interest rates was on display the same day as Mr. Trump’s speech, when shares plunged on fears of higher rates after the 10-year Treasury yield rose above 2.7 percent; that’s still very low by historic standards, but higher than when Mr. Trump took office.\n",
      "The big tax cut is a large economic stimulus, and “right now stimulus is a danger,” said Professor Auerbach, given that there is nearly full employment and already-strong economic growth.\n",
      "We’ll know a year from now whether the Federal Reserve stuck with its projected three increases in rates this year, and whether any exceeded quarter-point increments.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The bottom line: Presidents tend to get credit (or blame) for whatever economies they preside over, but it’s far too soon to evaluate Mr. Trump’s long-term impact. Even after years have passed, Professor Slemrod said, “We’ll never know with 100 percent certainty.”\n",

In May the company moved into the Salesforce tower in downtown Indianapolis, the tallest building in Indiana, representing a commitment from the company that “we’re here to stay,” Mr. Stutz said.\n",

      "Neither the city nor the state has said what, if any, tax or other incentives it is offering Amazon.\n",

      "With a population of 855,000 (ranked 15th among United States cities), in a metropolitan area of more than two million, Indianapolis is larger and more diverse than many people realize. The city has a highly regarded symphony, art museum, ballet and school of ballet, and zoo.\n",

That may be a challenge.\n",

Ms. Powell later served as both deputy national security adviser for strategy and senior counselor for economic initiatives.\n",

Bannon, the chief White House strategist, who worked at the bank early in his career and who reported directly to the president.\n",

Surprise! That should have been obvious to anyone who knows anything about Trump.”\n",
      "Roy C. Smith, a former Goldman partner and professor of management practice at New York University’s Stern School of Business, agreed. “I never really thought the Goldman crowd would tame Trump,” he said. “They didn’t share a common agenda or a common bond.”\n",
      "That was almost immediately apparent as the White House descended into multiple warring factions, with the Goldman alumni often in opposing camps. The flame-throwing impulses of Mr. Bannon, in particular, were often at odds with the more measured, pragmatic styles of Mr. Cohn and Ms. Powell.

      "Mr. Bannon and Mr. Scaramucci aside, “any so-called exodus may be a function of what they achieved,” Mr. Gingrich said of the Goldman veterans.\n",
      "“There’s nothing on the agenda this year that’s nearly as exciting as reshaping the tax code,” he said. “They worked very hard and tried to do things that were effective. In that sense they were a real asset.”\n",

      "Whether Mr. Trump can replace the departing Goldman alumni with people of similar stature remains to be seen. Mr. Gingrich pointed to Mr. Trump’s appointment of Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chairman as evidence that he will be able to recruit top economic talent.\n",
      "Professor Smith said anyone considering a job at the White House would have to weigh the high risks of tethering his or her reputation to the Trump presidency. Even so, he said, “you can never underestimate the allure of being a big shot in Washington.’’\n",

      "As it stands now, the proposed House tax bill would give the undeserving rich — legatees who will inherit multimillion dollar estates — a $172.2 billion tax break over the next ten years. In doing so, the measure would further entrench the super rich, a class that in recent years has acquired a growing share of both income and wealth.\n",
      "Jason Furman, a professor of economics at Harvard’s Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013 to 2017, emailed his response to my inquiry about the impact of the bill on households with different incomes:\n",
      "The House tax bill would lead to substantial redistribution from the middle-class to high-income households. Moreover, the particular form of the high-income tax cuts is designed to reward and perpetuate wealth in several respects. Much of the corporate rate cut would provide a windfall for the returns on capital investments that have already been made. Going forward, much of the effect of the plan would be to reduce the tax on monopoly rents — often to negative effective rates which means taxpayers would be subsidizing corporations.\n",
      "estate tax repeal would have eliminated. This would mean that not only are estates not taxed but that much of capital gains could permanently escape taxation, substantially increasing dynastic wealth accumulation.\n",
      "While proposing to eliminate the estate tax altogether, the House bill would retain a provision in current law — the step-up in basis — that effectively wipes out all tax liability for heirs on the increased value of assets at the time of death. Forbes declared, “this is a tax cut for the rich,” and described what would happen using the step-up in basis if you died with an estate that had grown in value from $10 million to $100 million:\n",
      "There would be no estate tax, and your heirs could sell the stock right after your death and owe no capital gains taxes on the $90 million gain.\n",
      "Many of the very richest Americans have children who stand to benefit enormously if the proposed tax bill is enacted. The list of these billionaires includes Mark Zuckerberg, Michael Bloomberg, Larry Ellison, Charles Koch, Sergey Brin, Larry Page, Phil Knight, Carl Icahn, Pierre Omidyar, David Koch, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Steve Ballmer, Sheldon Adelson, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, George Soros, and, of course, Donald Trump.\n",
      "repealing the tax would give about 330 estates (which are each worth more than $50 million) each a tax cut averaging more than $20 million compared to current law.\n",
      "The estate-tax provisions in the proposed bill are explicitly designed to help preserve and protect the assets of the wealthiest Americans. And despite their stated purpose, the corporate tax breaks in the legislation will not encourage new investment, according to many economists, but will instead reduce the taxes due on existing investments.\n",
      "Alan Krueger, a professor of economics at Princeton who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2011 to 2013, put the case against the Republican tax bill succinctly in an email:\n",
      "Several components of the House bill favor physical and financial capital over labor and human capital — namely, the lower rate for passive pass through income, the repeal of the estate tax, the big cut in the corporate tax rate, the failure to end the carried interest loophole, etc. At the same time, the tax on university endowments and treatment of grad student fellowships will slow human capital investment.\n",
      "If enacted, these features of the proposal would also deepen and further entrench existing class divisions and reduce economic mobility.\n",
      "One of the biggest obstacles facing critics of the tax bill is that laws governing taxation are extremely complex. The description of the bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation is 299-pages long and it details only the bill’s provisions, without any discussion of possible economic consequences. Crucial provisions governing arcane but crucial matters like carried interest, step-up in basis, pass-through corporations and passive investments are inherently opaque.\n",
      "In an effort to inform the public, the Joint Committee and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center have released charts and analyses explaining who benefits and who loses by income class. Both the committee and the center challenge Republican claims that the main goal of the legislation is to give the middle class a tax break.\n",
      "The largest cuts, in dollars and as a percentage of after-tax income, would accrue to higher-income households. However, not all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under this proposal — at least 7 percent of taxpayers would pay higher taxes under the proposal in 2018 and at least 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more in 2027.\n",
      "By 2027, the center found, those in the bottom two quintiles would, on average, get very modest annual cuts of $10 and $40; those in the third, fourth and fifth quintiles would get average cuts of $320, $710 and $3,860. Those in the top 1 percent would get a $52,780 tax cut and those in the top 0.1 percent a $278,370 cut.\n",
      "In other words, the Trump tax bill, contrary to the president’s populist spin, is a classic trickle-down proposal, concentrating by far the largest share of benefits on corporations and the rich.\n",
      "The most expensive parts of the tax bill are a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 20 percent, with lost revenues totaling $1.46 trillion over ten years, along with a five-year provision letting corporations immediately write off the entire cost of capital investments, instead of depreciating them over several years, with an additional revenue loss of $84.2 billion.\n",
      "Larry Summers, a professor of economics at Harvard who served as secretary of the Treasury from 1999 to 2001, argues, along with a number of other economists, that the combination of the rate cut and the immediate write-off of investments — known as “expensing” — amounts to a very high-cost expenditure that produces very little social benefit.\n",
      "What is the compelling case for cutting the corporate rate to 20 per cent? Under the proposed plan, for at least five years businesses will be able to write off investments in new equipment entirely in the year they are made. So the government is sharing to an equal extent in the costs of and the returns from investment, eliminating any tax induced disincentive to invest. The effective tax rate on new investment is reduced to zero or less, before even considering the corporate rate reduction. Corporate rate reduction serves only to reward monopoly profits, other rents or past investments. After the trends of the past few years, are shareholders really the most worthy recipients of a windfall?\n",
      "if corporations can immediately write off new investments for equipment, then the corporate rate cut on those investments amounts to only a windfall gain, cutting taxes on returns to old investment. With expensing, corporations that use debt financing with tax deductible interest payments end up getting tax rebates to cover some of the costs of new investments regardless of the statutory tax rate.\n",
      "So what must you do, or whom must you be, to get the 25% rate? First, you get it for 100% of your net business income from passive activities, which generally are business activities in which you personally do not materially participate. This typically applies to people who invest money in all kinds of partnerships, S corporation activities, et cetera that engage in pretty much any type of business.\n",
      "Shaviro calls this obscure set of provisions in the tax bill “a weapon to enhance plutocracy — offering the biggest rate cut to millionaires,” allowing those “who are in effect rentiers to get the low (25 percent) rate” on all their income.\n",
      "Pass-through income would be taxed at no more than 25 percent, far below the 39.6 percent top individual income tax rate that now applies to pass-through income, or the top 35% top rate that would apply to individual income under the GOP plan. This would provide a massive windfall to the very wealthy.\n",
      "This section of the bill has been nicknamed the “Trump loophole” by the center\n",
      "because Donald Trump exemplifies the type of business owner whom it would most benefit.\n",
      "We don’t know how much Trump collects in such income, which has become passive for him since he put his children in charge of his enterprises rather than running them himself. But given that he seems to have stakes in at least 500 pass-through entities, it looks like reducing his rate to 25 percent from 39.6 percent would save him a ton of money.\n",
      "Ditch the pass-through break, the one that taxes income of partnerships and other businesses organized in forms other than corporations at a rate lower than it taxes wages. This is a compliance and complexity nightmare. There’s no economic reason to apply lower tax rates on businesses based on how they are organized, no justification to tax entrepreneurial income differently based on how it is earned, and no way to differentiate between one form of business activity and other without onerous rules and intrusive audits.\n",
      "For political reasons, Looney argues, Republicans should eliminate the break to\n",
      "help avoid the caricature of “tax cuts for the rich.” No form of income is more concentrated among top-income taxpayers than pass-through business income and the reduced rate would only benefit taxpayers in the highest two brackets (e.g., married taxpayers earning over $260,000).\n",

      "The extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has led many people to worry that this market is a giant bubble. Many, including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, have warned about a “Bitcoin bust” that could rival the dot-com crash of 2000 and wipe out speculators.\n",
      "But the bigger concern about cryptocurrencies may be the damage they could do, in the long run, to government finances through lost tax revenue.\n",
      "The core technology underlying cryptocurrencies, known as blockchain, is premised on anonymity: Transactions are public but linked only to an electronic address. This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractive.\n",
      "But anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy, which is now conducted largely via cash. The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue. The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around $500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone. And the underground economy in the United States — estimated at 8.4 percent of output — is relatively small compared with those of other countries.\n",
      "If cryptocurrencies were to replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange, they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash. There is no need to visit an A.T.M., and you can securely pay people regardless of their location. No wonder Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become “the next Swiss bank account.”\n",
      "The I.R.S. understands this, which is why it has been pushing to break the anonymity of cryptocurrencies. In November, it persuaded a federal judge to order Coinbase, a popular Bitcoin exchange, to reveal the identity of the customers for more than 14,000 accounts (representing nearly nine million transactions).\n",
      "Blockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the I.R.S. to tax cryptocurrency trading profits. Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the I.R.S. to prove: Suppose A, B and C are electronic addresses you own. You let the I.R.S. know you own A, but not B and C. You buy one Bitcoin at $15,000 and park it at A, expecting the price to go up. Just a few hours later, when a Bitcoin is worth $15,500, you send that Bitcoin to B and then to C.\n",
      "A few months later, when your Bitcoin is now worth $25,000, you send it from C to A and tell the I.R.S., “I sold a Bitcoin to an anonymous counterparty at B back at $15,500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for $25,000.” As a result, you owe taxes on capital gains of just $500 rather than $10,000.\n",
      "The I.R.S. can observe all the transactions between A, B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain, but it cannot disprove that B and C are “arm’s length” counterparties (that is, independent and not colluding). Rules in the United States that require financial institutions to verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem, because as far as the I.R.S. knows, B and C could have been set up by a foreign institution that does not comply with such rules.\n",
      "It is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits. The only question is how heavy-handed the response would be.\n",
      "One approach would be for the government to accept the difficulty of directly taxing cryptocurrency transactions and to offset the revenue losses by raising tax rates. The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate, so this response would transform revenue losses into a lower gross domestic product.\n",
      "More likely, the United States would take a tougher approach and attempt to ban cryptocurrencies. This solution throws the baby out with the bath water. While cryptocurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations, they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions, especially for the poor, and less reliance on banks, which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve to control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runs.\n",
      "A smarter response would be for the government to switch from taxing income when it is received to taxing income when it is spent. Many economists support moving to this kind of consumption tax, but it would require a major overhaul of the tax code.\n",
      "The prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government; it is also a problem for the cryptocurrencies themselves. For cryptocurrencies to survive long enough to be an effective means of performing everyday transactions, the cryptocurrency community will need to find a way to prevent tax evasion. This will involve a tricky balancing act, preserving anonymity while providing the I.R.S. with sufficient information to prevent tax evasion.\n",
      "More generally, cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn to trust government. Since this goes against the very ethos of the cryptocurrency movement, it poses the most difficult — but no less necessary — challenge.\n",

      "One of my fondest childhood memories is of my family’s annual holiday trip to St. Louis to see the department store windows. I was transfixed by the corner window at Famous-Barr, where model trains wound their way through a labyrinth of tunnels and bridges in a snow-covered mountain landscape.\n",
      "Even after a decades-long decline of America’s urban centers as shopping meccas, New York remains a redoubt of holiday tradition. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade officially kicks off the Christmas shopping season, and elaborate department store windows are still a major draw for tourists.\n",
      "“It would be a public relations disaster to eliminate them,” he said. But, he added, “I suspect they’ll quietly cut back, spend less, become less elaborate. And they’ll disappear when the companies themselves eventually disappear.”\n",
      "It’s hard to fault struggling retailers for trying to recoup some of the cost, but part of the windows’ allure has always been that they were pure fantasies untainted by any overtly commercial appeal. Those days seem to have passed.\n",
      "At Lord & Taylor, this year’s windows are co-branded by the Hallmark Channel, which is promoting its “Countdown to Christmas” holiday programming. Farther uptown, the windows at Saks Fifth Avenue not only carry the Mastercard logo, but the “Snow White” theme on display is basically a plug for the Walt Disney Company, which said it had entered a “promotional partnership’’ with Saks for the windows. (To both stores’ credit, there are no paid product placements in the windows, a trend that has infected some other holiday windows in the city.)\n",
      "The crowds jostling to see Lord & Taylor’s displays used to be so large that ropes were deployed to maintain an orderly flow. But when I stopped by this week, the pedestrians on Fifth Avenue were rushing by, and few paused to take a look. No ropes were needed. Down the street, the repurposed B. Altman department store, which now houses the City University of New York’s Graduate Center, sat like a hulking ghost of Christmas past.\n",
      "Still, there was plenty of greenery and lots of twinkling lights on the Lord & Taylor facade, and holiday music wafted over the sidewalk. The windows themselves were charming, although less elaborate than the ones I remembered from years past. Saks also featured an impressive full-facade light show after dusk. Its windows were attracting somewhat larger crowds during the day when I stopped by.\n",
      "Tiffany Bourre, a spokeswoman for Hudson’s Bay, the parent company of Lord & Taylor and Saks, assured me the sale of the Lord & Taylor building to WeWork would not affect the window displays in the future, and that the company was committed to the store’s “rich history” of holiday traditions. After the sale, Lord & Taylor will still occupy some of the building. She said that the holiday windows and light show at Saks would continue “for years to come.”\n",
      "Hudson’s Bay does not break out the cost of the window displays, but they are expensive. Ms. Bourre said the Lord & Taylor windows were created by nearly 75 artists, craftsmen and engineers who put in more than 35,000 hours on the project. She did not try to justify the expense in purely economic terms. “The holiday windows are considered a gift to the city,” she said.\n",
      "Mr. Cohen said he got “all kinds of grief” from executives at Federated Department Stores after he spent over $100,000 to renovate the holiday windows at the flagship Lazarus department store in downtown Columbus, Ohio, in the early 1990s; at the time he was chairman and chief executive of Lazarus, then a division of Federated.\n",
      "The window displays and holiday traditions “were never overtly commercial,” said Jan Whitaker, the author of “Service and Style: How the American Department Store Fashioned the Middle Class,” and other books about department stores. “In their heyday, they did a lot of things that weren’t directly linked to sales.”\n",
      "The goal was to attract people to the stores with amenities like tearooms, restaurants, fashion shows and even nurseries. But the rise of Walmart and other discount chains in the mid-1960s, Ms. Whitaker said, “drove a stake into the heart of the downtown stores.” As shoppers focused on price above all else and old-line stores moved to the suburbs, she added, “The department stores dispensed with just about everything — the displays, the decorations, the free gift wrap and alterations, the free delivery.”\n",
      "It now seems ironic, Ms. Whitaker continued, that department stores were once criticized for overcommercializing Christmas with their window displays. (A religious revival in the mid-1950s, she said, prompted a short-lived focus on angels, carolers and manger scenes.) “The department stores created a magical sense of occasion,” she said. “Families came and brought their children. Years later, they wouldn’t remember the gifts they got in any given year, but they remembered the windows. Those children became future customers.”\n",
      "Shopping now, she said, is “not an experience.”\n",
      "“It’s just about buying something at the lowest price,” she said. “ I find it kind of depressing, but there’s no point in wallowing in nostalgia.”\n",
      "Mr. Cohen agreed. “We’ve crossed the Rubicon into gross commercialism,” he said. “There used to be an almost spiritual sense of kinship that gift-giving and gathering together enhanced, and the store displays and marketing tried to embrace that. Now the holiday is just the trigger for an extreme state of acquisitiveness. Holiday décor and atmosphere just get in the way of that.”\n",
      "For holiday purists, it’s an ominous sign that traditional department stores are getting battered by the stock market. As of this week, Hudson’s Bay shares were down nearly 20 percent for the year. Macy’s stock was down about 28 percent. Both companies have attracted activist investors who have been pushing to use their real estate holdings to raise money. They have shown scant interest in maintaining expensive holiday traditions.\n",
      "By comparison, shares in Best Buy, one of the few success stories among brick-and-mortar retailers, have gained nearly 56 percent this year. Best Buy has withstood the combined onslaught of Amazon and Walmart by focusing relentlessly on price, product selection, technical support and internet sales and marketing. It spends almost nothing on traditional holiday attractions.\n",
      "A visit to the new Nordstrom Rack store just south of Herald Square may be a vision of Christmas future. Under the glare of unadorned florescent lights, it might as well have been January.\n",
      "“I can’t possibly imagine these traditions ever coming back,” Ms. Whitaker said.\n",
      "The Famous-Barr store I visited as a child was rebranded after Macy’s bought its parent company, the May Company, in 2005, and Macy’s closed the flagship downtown location in 2013. The holiday train window, with its seven passenger and freight trains and 300 feet of track, had been maintained since 1988 by a group of local model railroad enthusiasts, the American Flyer “S” Gaugers of St. Louis. After the Famous-Barr store closed, the group moved the display to the National Museum of Transportation, in Kirkwood, Mo., where it is now the centerpiece of a holiday train exhibit.\n",

      "For more than two decades R. Kelly, the multiplatinum R&B idol repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct, has outrun his reputation. In the age of #MeToo, it may finally be catching up to him.\n",
      "In a statement from and addressed to women of color, Time’s Up wrote: “The scars of history make certain that we are not interested in persecuting anyone without just cause. With that said, we demand appropriate investigations and inquiries into the allegations of R. Kelly’s abuse made by women of color and their families for over two decades now.”\n",
      "“This is starting to feel like a success,” Oronike Odeleye, a founder of the #MuteRKelly campaign, said in an interview on Monday. “Having Time’s Up amplify it, support it — this community, this village is stepping in and demanding that these things change.”\n",
      "The Time’s Up letter cited RCA Records, a division of Sony Music that has released R. Kelly’s last four albums; Ticketmaster, a division of the mega-promoter Live Nation, which sells tickets to his concerts; Spotify and Apple Music, the popular streaming services; and the Greensboro Coliseum Complex, a venue scheduled to host the singer this month in North Carolina. (RCA and Apple declined to comment. Spotify, Ticketmaster and the Greensboro Coliseum did not respond to requests for comment.)\n",
      "Representatives for Mr. Kelly replied in a statement on Monday. “R. Kelly supports the pro-women goals of the Time’s Up movement,” they wrote. “We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals — and in this case, it is unjust and off-target.”\n",
      "Calling the campaign “a greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him, his family and the women with whom he spends his time,” the statement continued: “R. Kelly’s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never — and will never — be silenced. Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it. We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture.”\n",
      "After years of touring and new music from R. Kelly that passed without much incident, interest in the allegations against the singer picked up again last summer after a series of articles by the longtime Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatis.\n",
      "The articles last year also resurfaced claims about R. Kelly — such as the brief marriage to his musical protégé, Aaliyah, in 1994, when she was 15 and he was 27 — which, when combined with the new information, galvanized Ms. Odeleye, an Atlanta resident, to start what would become #MuteRKelly.\n",
      "“After reading the history and realizing he was doing it in my backyard, I remember sitting at my computer and feeling furious and overwhelmed,” she said. “I decided to start a petition to get him off the radio. If the police can’t seem to arrest this man, we as a community can at least say we’re not going to give him our money.” (The Fulton County District Attorney’s Office in Georgia said it was not currently investigating Mr. Kelly over any allegations.)\n",
      "Ms. Odeleye soon joined forces with a local activist, Kenyette Barnes, who helped to organize local petitions and protests wherever R. Kelly had concerts scheduled. “He is a man of power — the king of R&B,” Ms. Barnes said. “You don’t become the king without a very strong fan base and support system. We wanted to dismantle that.”\n",
      "Ten concerts were called off, and while promoters cited various reasons including low ticket sales, Ms. Odeleye and Ms. Barnes said they had no doubt that their protests had worked. And within months the women’s mission began to dovetail with the growing chorus of those saying #MeToo, and momentum for #MuteRKelly picked up. A BBC documentary that aired in March, “R Kelly: Sex, Girls and Videotapes,” added to the growing discontent.\n",
      "“Within the African-American community, unfortunately, the issue of child sexual abuse is very, very taboo,” Ms. Odeleye said. “We have a tendency to try to separate the child from the abuser, but we will not kick the dangerous person out of homes, out of our communities. That’s just not good enough.”\n",
      "Trevian Kutti, a former spokeswoman for the singer, confirmed on Monday that she and a personal assistant, Diana Copeland, were no longer affiliated with him, citing only “unfortunate circumstances.” Still, Ms. Kutti spoke admiringly about the singer.\n",
      "“I am no longer successfully able to represent Mr. Robert Kelly,” she wrote in an email. “Mr. Kelly is ‘The World’s Greatest.’ I am grateful to have had the experience of representing him.”\n",
      "Linda Mensch, a lawyer who recently represented the singer, said she resigned in February but declined to comment further.\n",
      "Despite the rash of accusations, Mr. Kelly is not known to be facing any investigations for sexual abuse. Susan E. Loggans, a lawyer who has negotiated at least three settlements with women who said they were victimized by the singer, said that criminal prosecution continued to seem unlikely.\n",
      "“I feel that since he was already tried, already acquitted,” she said, referring to the 2008 case, “that state’s attorneys are reluctant to do it. It costs millions of dollars, would drag on for a long period of time and there is a general skepticism about whether it would be successful.”\n",
      "“If he got acquitted next time, nobody would ever have a chance,” Ms. Loggans said. “Prosecution is very hesitant to do that over again.”\n",
      "For now, Mr. Kelly appears most concerned with the state of his live concert business — a reliable revenue stream for any artist of his hit-making caliber. In a video posted to Twitter on Sunday, he insisted that he would be performing on May 11 in North Carolina, and he questioned why his Chicago appearance was scrapped.\n",
      "“I’ve never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors,” he said, “but I guess there’s a first time for everything.”\n",
      "“It ain’t on me,” he added.\n",

      "Rupert Murdoch, the media mogul who is executive chairman of 21st Century Fox, is one of President Trump’s closest allies and advisers. Fox News has been the president’s most reliable media champion. Mr. Murdoch and the president have each publicly described the other as “my good friend.”\n",
      "Because AT&T and Time Warner aren’t direct competitors, and the suit was such a break with Justice Department tradition, it gave rise to speculation that the real motive was to punish CNN, the Time Warner-owned Trump punching bag.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The $52.4 billion Disney-Fox deal, in which Disney is acquiring Fox’s venerable movie studio and the bulk of its other entertainment assets, poses the opposite problem: 21st Century Fox is controlled by the Murdoch family.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Even though antitrust decisions are supposed to be independent of political influence, Mr. Trump didn’t hesitate to weigh in when the deal was announced. “I know that the president spoke with Rupert Murdoch earlier today, congratulated him on the deal and thinks that, to use one of the president’s favorite words, that this could be a great thing for jobs,” the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters.\n",
      "“It looks bad to me,” said Christopher L. Sagers, an antitrust professor at Cleveland-Marshall College of Law.\n",
      "Larry Downes, an antitrust expert and a fellow at the Georgetown McDonough School of Business, agreed. “The government’s theory in Time Warner very much applies to Fox and Disney,” he said. If the government “doesn’t challenge this, it will look very weird,” he added. “But I’m not sure appearances matter to this administration.”\n",
      "“I have never been instructed by the White House on this or any other transaction under review by the antitrust division,” he said of the AT&T case.\n",
      "That’s unlikely to stop speculation about his division’s handling of the latest blockbuster. Antitrust experts told me that in many ways the Disney-Fox deal raises even more antitrust questions than does the combination of AT&T and Time Warner. That’s because it’s both a merger of direct competitors — a so-called horizontal merger, which typically get close scrutiny — and has some of the same vertical elements that caused the Justice Department to try to block the AT&T-Time Warner merger.\n",
      "Whether a combination of the Fox film and television studios with Disney’s entertainment arm would raise red flags under Justice Department guidelines depends on how the government defines the market. The deal would reduce the number of Hollywood studios to five from six. Last year, Disney’s studio accounted for 26.4 percent of the domestic theatrical box office, the largest share, and Fox was third, with 12.9 percent. Although the combined studios would have had close to 40 percent of the market in 2016, that’s typically not enough to run afoul of the department’s merger guidelines, Mr. Sagers pointed out, unless the government decides to define the market differently.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "If the market is as narrow as films about superheroes, and Disney gains control of Fox’s “X-Men” franchise, that would almost surely trigger concerns.\n",
      "There are more serious antitrust issues about Fox’s regional sports networks, given ESPN’s dominance of cable sports. If that market is measured by cable sports revenue, the Disney-owned ESPN is so dominant that nearly any acquisition of another cable sports provider, even Fox’s relatively small regional networks, would trigger antitrust review.\n",
      "“From a horizontal perspective, sports is the main issue,” said Scott Hemphill, a law professor and antitrust expert at New York University School of Law.\n",
      "If the Justice Department really wanted to be aggressive, it might also invoke the words of former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, who wrote in a landmark opinion, “The widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential to the welfare of the public.”\n",

      "Under terms of the proposed deal, Fox shareholders would own about 25 percent of Disney in an all-stock transaction. Given the concentrated market for cable news, a combination of Fox News and Disney’s ABC would most likely not have passed antitrust muster. But depending on how much influence the Murdochs are able to exert at Disney, the family might achieve much the same objective, perhaps with a board seat, or, as some have speculated, if James Murdoch joins Disney as an executive and even becomes a potential successor to the Disney chief executive, Robert Iger.\n",
      "Such speculation may not be all that far-fetched. “Reports suggest that James Murdoch is apparently in line for a senior management role within Disney as part of the deal,” said Doug Creutz, senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen & Co. in a note to clients Thursday.\n",
      "Mr. Iger said during a conference call Thursday that James Murdoch’s future role, if any, hasn’t been decided.\n",
      "Mr. Hemphill, the law professor and antitrust expert, pointed to an emerging antitrust doctrine called common ownership, which looks beyond the formality of separate companies to examine who actually exerts control.\n",
      "All those concerns are based on traditional antitrust review standards. But since the case against AT&T and Time Warner was filed, those standards have been anything but traditional.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Vertical mergers like that of AT&T and Time Warner — AT&T buys content from Time Warner, but doesn’t compete directly with it — used to be approved almost routinely, albeit often with conditions. No longer. “We’re in a topsy-turvy antitrust world,” Mr. Downes said.\n",
      "One of the government’s concerns in its effort to block the AT&T deal, according to its complaint, is the risk that AT&T would withhold Time Warner content from rivals like Netflix, thus hurting consumers.\n",
      "But Disney, as it prepares to start its own direct-to-consumer Netflix rival, is already withholding some content, and has said it would withhold much more as existing agreements expire. It will almost surely pull 21st Century Fox content, like “X Men,” the planned “Avatar” sequels and TV shows like “The Simpsons” and “The Americans,” and offer them on its own service.\n",
      "Mr. Downes said he doesn’t see how the Justice Department would distinguish between the two deals, should it approve the Fox-Disney transaction.\n",
      "How Mr. Delrahim and the antitrust division handle the Fox-Disney review remains to be seen, of course. But whatever he decides, the shadow of Mr. Murdoch will loom large.\n",
      "“I hesitate to make any predictions about Trump and what he’ll do,” Mr. Sagers said. “But there’s a long tradition that the White House shouldn’t get involved in these decisions.”\n",
      "He said he was “reluctant to believe” that Mr. Delrahim would allow politics or Mr. Trump’s friendship with Mr. Murdoch to influence his decision — “but maybe I’m being naïve.”\n",

      "When the Harvard Business School was founded in 1908, the first entirely graduate-level professional business program in the country was described by the future Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell as a “great” but “delicate experiment.” Today the school is indisputably great, but hardly delicate. It accepted just 12 percent of nearly 10,000 M.B.A. applicants in 2016. Eighty-nine percent of those who were accepted attended, which means that Harvard remains the overwhelming first choice among graduate schools of business, despite occasional rankings that put Stanford, Yale or Northwestern ahead of it. There are more than 76,000 living Harvard M.B.A. alumni, 33 percent of whom live outside the United States, forming what is very likely the most potent network of any graduate school.\n",
      "The marriage of Harvard’s prestige and intellectual pedigree to overtly moneymaking pursuits has yielded an institution that not only teaches the fundamentals of business education but also provides its soon-to-be-wealthy graduates with “unrivaled opportunity,” and has become a “money machine unto itself,” as Duff McDonald puts it in his sweeping survey of the school’s history and influence.\n",
      "But how and why that might be the case isn’t really what interests McDonald, the author of previous books about McKinsey, the consulting firm, and JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon. In “The Golden Passport,” he’s determined to call the Harvard Business School to account, citing its founding doctrine, which was to develop “a heightened sense of responsibility among businessmen” (and eventually women) who “will handle their current business problems in socially constructive ways.” In that regard, McDonald is scathing in his critique: Harvard Business School has not only “proven an enormous failure,” but its very success has made it positively “dangerous.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "He drives home the point in chapter after chapter, picking up steam in more recent decades: Harvard, he maintains, provided the ideological underpinnings for the junk-bond-induced takeover mania and resulting scandals of the 1980s; the corporate scandals of the 2000s; the egregious increase in the pay gap between chief executives and ordinary employees; the real estate mortgage bubble and ensuing financial crisis; even the election of Donald Trump. In McDonald’s view, the school has contributed to pretty much every bad thing that has happened in American business and the economy in the last century. In the wake of whatever scandal or financial collapse or recession to which it has contributed, it wipes its hands, distances itself and still has the nerve to put forth its experts as the solution to problems.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In virtually every instance, McDonald contends, Harvard has obsessively pursued money, sending a disproportionate number of its graduates to consulting firms beginning in the 1950s (it was all but synonymous with McKinsey), to Wall Street in the 1980s and to entrepreneurial start-ups once initial public offerings became the rage in the 1990s — and provided intellectual justifications for its actions. Much of that wealth found its way back to the school itself. Its professors earn enormous sums as consultants to businesses populated by their former students, who also give generously to their alma mater: Its endowment stood at $3.3 billion by 2015, a dedicated portion of the university’s enormous $32.7 billion.\n",
      "McDonald’s criticism of Michael Jensen, now an emeritus professor, is especially withering. As he sees it, Jensen bears major responsibility for the rapacious hostile takeovers and the obsession with stock prices and short-term results that led to the Enron and WorldCom scandals, as well as for the emergence of outlandishly high chief executive pay.\n",
      "Jensen came to the business school in 1984, just as the junk-bond-fueled takeover boom was gaining steam, and he became a full-time faculty member in 1989. Undeniably one of the most influential business theorists of modern times, he advocated an “agency” theory of management in which management’s sole duty was to maximize shareholder value. This upended the long-held “stakeholder” model, in which management was seen as having broader obligations to a corporation’s workers, customers and communities.\n",
      "Jensen’s theories had simplicity and consistency: If all that matters is shareholder value, then hostile takeovers, leveraged buyouts and other forms of financial engineering are fine as long as they boost share prices, no matter that battalions of workers have to be fired and community relations damaged. Jensen also championed share-based executive compensation on the grounds that no matter how much executives were paid, shareholders benefited. This was an idea that swept corporate America. McDonald notes that in 1992, the C.E.O.s of Fortune 500 firms made an average of $2.7 million a year. By 2000, the average was $14 million.\n",

      "View all New York Times newsletters.\n",
      "Just about every premise of the “agency” model, McDonald says, has now been punctured, but only long after the damage has been done. An obsession with stock prices and short-term results was the motive for many of the accounting scandals of the 2000s, which were designed to prop up share prices, and as a result, high executive pay. Even Jensen eventually had to concede that the liberal use of stock options as executive compensation had become “managerial heroin.”\n",
      "Jensen is just one of many examples of the insidious relationship between Harvard Business School theory and real-world calamities in ”The Golden Passport,” but it seems worth asking: Is McDonald’s broadside fair? Apart from a few brief quotations from his published work, we don’t hear from Jensen himself, or any of the other still-living culprits McDonald identifies. It’s hard to fault McDonald, who reports that Harvard Business School “shut me out entirely” when he sought cooperation, and pretty much shut down everyone who works there. That seems a shame. McDonald insists he isn’t “anti-business-school” (he attended Wharton), nor is he “anti-wealth.” Nonetheless, he says he found the rejection “liberating.”\n",
      "But I missed a greater sense of balance. It doesn’t seem fair, to take one major example, to blame Harvard for the recent financial crisis. While their actions remain a subject of spirited debate, the H.B.S. graduates assembled by McDonald — starting with former President George W. Bush, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former S.E.C. Chairman Christopher Cox — are credited by many with mitigating the damage and saving the country from an even worse catastrophe. To take just one counterexample, the young former Goldman Sachs investment banker Fabrice Tourre, one of the few Wall Street figures actually found guilty of civil fraud for his role in the kind of complex mortgage deals that contributed to the crisis, is a graduate of France’s École Centrale and Stanford University. (France’s prestigious “Grandes Écoles” — not H.B.S. — appear to have generated a disproportionate number of the financial engineers who unwittingly helped cause the crisis.) Given the large number of Harvard Business grads in high-ranking executive positions, it’s inevitable that many would be ensnared in what turned into a global catastrophe. It’s a shame that some of them didn’t see the looming disaster and sound an alarm. But hardly anyone did, including graduates of every other business school.\n",
      "McDonald bookends his long and impressively researched account with a portrait of Casey Gerald, an African-American who delivered a 2014 Class Day speech that’s been viewed online over 200,000 times, and is featured on the school’s “Making a Difference” website. Gerald turned his back on a lucrative career in private equity to co-found a public interest organization to connect M.B.A. graduates with mission-driven businesses. This may suggest to some that it is hard to generalize about Harvard’s students, though McDonald isn’t stopped: He sees Gerald as one of a handful of “outliers,” the exception that proves the rule that most graduates are morally detached, single-minded fortune seekers.\n",
      "I suspect McDonald won’t be invited to campus anytime soon, but perhaps he should be: Agree with him or not, he deserves credit for raising questions that every business school needs to be asking. It’s hard to quarrel with his concluding plea: “H.B.S. should — and can — play a part in helping more people who think about business rediscover a purpose other than profit.” As he puts it: “It needs to graduate more people who are motivated to solve problems, and fewer people who create them.”\n",

      "Lawmakers from both chambers are now headed to conference, where they will try to work out their differences and emerge with a final bill that can be passed by the House and Senate and then sent to President Trump’s desk by Christmas.\n",
      "Getting a bill signed into law by Mr. Trump remains a top priority of Republican lawmakers, and momentum to get something to his desk quickly remains.\n",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump said that lawmakers were working on the bill “so that it comes out very beautifully.”\n",
      "“I call it ‘the mixer,’ he said. “It’s a conference where everyone gets together and they pick all the good things and get rid of the things they don’t like.”\n",
      "And, below, we outline some of the top issues that must be resolved before the legislation can be signed into law.\n",
      "Senate lawmakers, in their bill, seeking additional revenue, brought back the corporate alternative minimum tax and reinstated a limited version of the alternative minimum tax for individuals. The House bill eliminated both versions of the alternative minimum tax.\n",
      "Together, the Senate changes are expected to raise about $173 billion over the next decade. But the possible reinstatement of the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliciting significant blowback from businesses, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, manufacturing companies, technology companies and pharmaceutical companies, which say it would undermine their ability to use valuable tax credits.\n",
      "The reason: Both bills cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. But the corporate alternative minimum tax is also set at 20 percent. It is devised to ensure that companies cannot use loopholes to avoid paying taxes and requires that companies calculate their taxes under both the corporate rate and the alternative minimum rate and pay the greater amount.\n",
      "By lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent but keeping the alternative minimum tax, Congress is essentially setting a 20 percent floor. Companies that try to use tax breaks to lower their effective tax rate, like the research and development tax credit, would still face the 20 percent alternative minimum tax, nullifying the value of incentives that are supposed to promote research.\n",
      "Lawmakers are scrambling to resolve the issue. While they could simply do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax, the Senate would then have to find additional revenue to ensure the legislation stays within the $1.5 trillion bucket that Congress has created for the tax cuts.\n",
      "One possible solution floating around is to increase the corporate tax rate to 22 percent, rather than 20 percent, which would raise more revenue. But that plan may not sit well with House Republicans, many of whom have been unwavering in their push to lower the rate to 20 percent.\n",
      "The House bill guts a number of itemized deductions while the Senate bill expands them.\n",
      "Mortgage interest deduction\n",
      "• House caps at $500,000; Senate retains\n",
      "Medical expense deduction\n",
      "• House repeals; Senate expands\n",
      "Teacher deduction for school supplies; graduate student tuition waver; student loan interest deduction\n",
      "• House repeals all; Senate expands or retains all\n",
      "The Senate bill allows owners of businesses organized as pass-throughs to deduct 23 percent of their business income.\n",
      "The House bill sets a new 25 percent tax on pass-through businesses and builds guardrails to prevent companies from exploiting the loophole.\n",
      "The Senate bill creates seven income tax brackets: 10 percent, 12 percent, 22 percent, 24 percent, 32 percent, 35 percent and 38.5 percent. Those brackets expire at the end of 2025.\n",
      "The House bill creates four income tax brackets: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. Those brackets are permanent.\n",
      "The House bill ultimately kills the estate tax, which Republicans refer to as the death tax, because it is a tax on wealthy estates that are left to heirs.\n",
      "The Senate bill applies the death tax to fewer people by doubling the exemption to levels to $11 million for individuals and $22 million for couples, but it does not kill the tax.\n",
      "The Senate bill leaves the Johnson Amendment untouched.\n",
      "Repealing the amendment has long been a key priority of the religious right, which views the ban as an example of government hostility to religion in the public square. But such a repeal is opposed by thousands of religious and nonprofit leaders, who warn that it could blur the line between charity and politics.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the 1954 ban, and religious groups have said they expect it to be included in the final legislation.\n",

      "A 2013 study of red and blue America, conducted well before the seismic events of the last two years, sheds additional light on the Republican electorate and provides a more complicated understanding of contemporary conservatism.\n",
      "The most conservative and most Republican of the three psychological regions — which Rentfrow labels “Cluster 1: Friendly and Conventional” — extends across the northern tier of the United States from Montana to Michigan, down through the Midwest to almost all of the South for a total of 26 states. The accompanying map shows the region in shades of purple.\n",
      "Rentfrow found that the Cluster 1 region is\n",
      "less affluent, has fewer highly educated residents, and is less innovative compared with states in the other regions. States in this region also appeared to have higher levels of social capital and less social tolerance compared with states in other regions. Moreover, friendly and conventional states were more politically conservative and Protestant compared with other regions.\n",
      "Rentfrow and his co-authors write that the region\n",
      "is defined by moderately high levels of extroversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, moderately low neuroticism, and very low openness\n",
      "and that\n",
      "this configuration of traits portrays the sort of person who is sociable, considerate, dutiful, and traditional.\n",
      "I asked a number of experts in political psychology what they thought about the Rentfrow paper, and their answers ran the gamut from those who support a more empathetic portrayal of Republican voters to those who are adamant in their view that authoritarianism remains a dominant characteristic of those on the right.\n",
      "I started with Rentfrow himself. My question went as follows:\n",
      "Some research shows that Republicans, and Trump voters in particular, score high on measures of authoritarianism and on critical, if not hostile, views of African-Americans and immigrants. How does this fit with your finding that residents of the most Republican region are friendly, sociable and considerate?\n",
      "Rentfrow replied that\n",
      "individuals high in authoritarianism score low in openness. So in this sense, the patterns of results we find at the regional level are consistent.\n",
      "Many whites in the South, he argued, abide by an “honor culture.” As long\n",
      "as everyone is respectful and abides by the social norms, everyone is happy and agreeable. But when threats are made against one’s reputation or values, acts of violence and physical aggression are considered appropriate forms of retribution. In some ways, the profile we observe touches on the surface of this profile — the friendly and considerate aspect when all is well. But I think we’re now beginning to see more of the aggressive aspects. I think many people, perhaps especially in this region, have begun to feel threatened by the changes taking place in society and are reacting with anger.\n",
      "Stenner explained this seeming contradiction by noting that\n",
      "it is a lot easier to be generous and considerate and civic-minded and invested in one’s community if one’s community is full of people much like oneself. The kinds of behaviors we get out of authoritarians depend critically on how and where they have drawn the boundaries of “us” and “them.” They can be very attentive to “us,” but also tend to be very particular about whom “us” includes.\n",
      "John Jost, a professor of psychology and politics at N.Y.U., expands upon the implications of the word “conscientiousness” in describing red state voters:\n",
      "Conscientiousness is correlated with measures of racism, sexism, homophobia, prejudice, authoritarianism, social dominance, and system justification. I suspect that this personality factor has more to do with a need for order or desire for rule-following, which can easily take an authoritarian turn, than other aspects of conscientiousness that we might associate with, say, honesty or integrity.\n",
      "In the opposite corner from Jost, Marc Hetherington, a political scientist at Vanderbilt and a co-author of the 2009 book “Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics,” said he has abandoned use of the word “authoritarian” because he views it as excessively pejorative. In place of authoritarian, Hetherington said he will now use the phrase “fixed worldview.”\n",
      "“The adherence to established traditions, what scholars derisively call conventionalism, is very much a characteristic of high conscientiousness,” Hetherington wrote:\n",
      "Whether you think this is good or bad probably depends on what you think of community norms. In my view, there is a lot of good to many of them. Fixed worldview people want to protect them.\n",
      "Hetherington added a cautionary note:\n",
      "Here is the problem though. If you are perceived as outside that community, the enforcement of those norms isn’t going to feel very good.\n",
      "Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business, raised a crucial if obvious point: Primary season Trump voters do not represent all Republican voters.\n",
      "We can’t really know, just on the basis of this paper, whether these traits apply to Trump voters. All we can know is that these traits are more common in states and regions that voted for Trump. It is possible that the people who most show the positively valenced personality traits did not have Trump as their first choice in the primary, but then, once the general election came around, most of them voted for the Republican candidate, which is what partisans do in our two party system with very little party switching.\n",
      "Matt Motyl, a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, argued in an email that in the general election, the\n",
      "typical Trump voter is not a raging, screaming white nationalist; the typical Trump voter is not much different from the typical Romney, McCain, or Bush voter. They are just ordinary Republicans.\n",
      "There is, however, a subset of Trump supporters “who are extraordinarily vocal in their intolerance and white nationalism,” according to Motyl. These activists have become “the template of the stereotype of Trump voters,” he wrote. “As is the case for many stereotypes,” he added, “there is a grain of truth, but the grain of truth is just that — a grain.”\n",
      "In fact, authoritarian voters with a sense of besieged white identity are more than a “grain” in the Republican electorate.\n",
      "And the clout of the authoritarian, white identity wing of the Republican Party is such that Trump is governing to please this wing first and foremost.\n",
      "From his apocalyptic threats to Kim Jong-un to his call for the firing of protesting N.F.L. players, from his pardon of Joe Arpaio to his defense of pro-Nazi protesters in Charlottesville, Trump has remained the leader of hard-right, white America.\n",
      "This strategy won him the presidency in 2016 when millions of non-authoritarian white Republicans — sympathetic, kind, affectionate, conscientiousness, persevering, thorough and reliable — made a pact with the devil and chose party loyalty over conscience. Who’s to say it won’t work again?\n",

      "A last-minute scramble to shore up support from wavering Republican senators injected significant changes into the Senate tax bill.\n",
      "The overhaul will still cut taxes on individuals and businesses, but the changes will reduce some benefits while sweetening others. Some of the provisions lawmakers wanted will cost additional money, prompting the need to find offsets.\n",
      "Here’s a look at the main changes that are expected to be included in the Senate’s revised bill to be voted on later today.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The A.M.T. was created to limit the amount of deductions available to the richest Americans. Over the years, though, inflation has eaten away at its effectiveness — as has the exclusion of interest and dividend income, which insulates the richest Americans.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "But it brings in a lot of revenue — as much as $1 trillion over the next decade — so lawmakers are now planning to reduce, rather than repeal, the tax. The Senate bill will increase the individual exemption amounts that taxpayers using the A.M.T. are entitled to and will increase the taxable income level at which those exemption amounts begin to phase out. Both moves will provide some relief to those whose income and use of deductions requires them to use the A.M.T., but it is far different from the House bill, which eliminates the tax as part of its tax code “simplification” effort.\n",
      "The Senate bill also retains the corporate A.M.T., which was slated for elimination in both the Senate and House bill. Together, the changes are expected to raise about $173 billion over the next decade.\n",
      "The Senate bill is expected to allow taxpayers to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local property taxes paid, a provision in unison with the House bill.\n",

      "The original Senate bill called for elimination of the state and local tax deduction, which is primarily used in high-tax, Democrat-leaning states. But Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, insisted on including the limited property tax deduction, which will cost about $148 billion over a decade. That could ease one potential area of contention with the House bill.\n",
      "The Senate bill will sweeten the tax deduction for owners of businesses that are organized as pass-throughs, meaning the business income is taxed at the individual owner’s tax rate.\n",
      "The change will cost the United States government $114 billion over a decade.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "However, the House bill eliminated the deduction altogether, so that will be one area of potential contention when the two chambers try to reconcile their versions. The cost of that change is unclear, as of now.\n",
      "The Senate bill increases the tax rate that companies will have to pay on foreign corporate profits. The “deemed repatriation” provision in the Senate will now subject untaxed foreign corporate profits to immediate taxation at a rate of 14 percent for cash holdings and 7 percent for noncash holdings. That is up from the original proposal of 10 percent and 5 percent and in line with the House version.\n",
      "The change is expected to bring in an additional $97 billion over a decade.\n",
