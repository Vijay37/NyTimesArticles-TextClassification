      "Bernie Sanders is not going away. And why should he? The weather is nice, the crowds are enormous and he keeps winning primaries. Hillary Clinton has what appears to be an insurmountable lead in delegates, but hope springs eternal.\n",
      "“It is a steep hill to climb,” he admits.\n",
      "Actually, probably harder to surmount than Gangkhar Puensum. (Which is the world’s highest unclimbed mountain. I am telling you this to distract you from the subject of delegate counts.)\n",
      "But about Sanders: Democrats, what do you think he should do?\n",
      "A) Convention floor fight. “Game of Thrones”! Jon Snow is alive!\n",
      "C) Why can’t we all just get along?\n",
      "Personally, I think that last one is possible. Although it would probably be a good idea to avoid saying a Clinton nomination could be a “disaster simply to protect the status quo,” as Sanders’s campaign manager did in an email on Wednesday.\n",
      "In an ideal world the Democrats would nominate a presidential candidate who’s got an inspiring vision of change and the competence to run the country from Day 1. This person is not going to be on the ballot this year. So let Hillary Clinton have the nomination and give Bernie Sanders the party platform.\n",
      "He deserves a role. Sanders has spent the last year speaking about narrowing the gulf between the rich and the bottom 99 percent, fighting climate change and keeping special interests out of government. He’s inspired millions. It’s pretty much always the same speech, but he’s the one who can bring the music.\n",
      "(Question: Will the Republicans have a fight about their platform? Nah — Donald Trump will let his opponents put in anything they want. Look, the man has convention entertainment to plan. Given the option of choosing the party position on health care or the dance numbers, you know which way he’s going to go.)\n",
      "The Democrats could just make the Sanders speech into a platform, then join hands and march into the future. There actually aren’t a lot of areas of disagreement. Clinton thinks his call for free public college tuition is … well, let’s not say dumb. Dumb is not going to get you a united convention. Let’s just say too much of a good thing. But she does want free community college tuition. Did you know that? She announced it on the very first official stop of her campaign. Since then not, um, frequently. Feel free to remind her.\n",
      "And you know, if Clinton could actually deliver on those two promises, it would be stupendous. This is an excellent example of the Democratic bottom line: On many, many issues, her platform is what the Sanders platform would look like if it actually got through the congressional wringer.\n",
      "On other matters, the Democrats’ current policy divisions are just about doubting Hillary Clinton’s intentions. Sanders wants to bring back the Glass-Steagall Act, which bars commercial banks from going into the investment banking business. Clinton says she can crack down on Wall Street better with more recent legislation. Sanders followers don’t believe she means it.\n",
      "I say, be impressed that there’s a party full of young voters for whom “Glass-Steagall” is a big applause line. You can’t not want to encourage that. Put Glass-Steagall in the platform. Even if Clinton is right, all you’d have is duplication of effort, and it would be an excellent gesture of solidarity.\n",
      "Finally, there’s the influence of big-money donors on American politics. In theory, Sanders and Clinton are pretty much in the same place. But in practice, he’s built his entire campaign around the concept of throwing out special interest money, while Clinton’s barely provided lip service.\n",
      "“One of the four pillars of her campaign was going to be democracy issues,” said Fred Wertheimer, president of the reform group Democracy 21. “Well, the pillars haven’t been around too much.”\n",
      "Wertheimer had his heart broken by Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who both promised to make campaign finance a top priority, then didn’t. Hillary Clinton, he thinks, ought to promise something more specific that she could implement right away. “Set up a task force in the White House whose job it is to pursue this reform. Of top staff people,” he suggested.\n",
      "Or a blue-ribbon committee featuring Bernie Sanders. Who would certainly never let her hear the end of it if she failed to deliver. Put that in the platform and smoke it.\n",

      "Mr. Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.\n",
      "WASHINGTON — In nearly eight years in office, President Obama has sought to reshape the nation with a sweeping assertion of executive authority and a canon of regulations that have inserted the United States government more deeply into American life.\n",
      "Once a presidential candidate with deep misgivings about executive power, Mr. Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential history.\n",
      "Blocked for most of his presidency by Congress, Mr. Obama has sought to act however he could. In the process he created the kind of government neither he nor the Republicans wanted — one that depended on bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency. But once Mr. Obama got the taste for it, he pursued his executive power without apology, and in ways that will shape the presidency for decades to come.\n",
      "The Obama administration in its first seven years finalized 560 major regulations — those classified by the Congressional Budget Office as having particularly significant economic or social impacts. That was nearly 50 percent more than the George W. Bush administration during the comparable period, according to data kept by the regulatory studies center at George Washington University.\n",

      "An army of lawyers working under Mr. Obama’s authority has sought to restructure the nation’s health care and financial industries, limit pollution, bolster workplace protections and extend equal rights to minorities. Under Mr. Obama, the government has literally placed a higher value on human life.\n",

      "Articles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought to the nation, and how the presidency has changed him.\n",
      "And it has imposed billions of dollars in new costs on businesses and consumers.\n",
      "Many of the new rules are little known, even as they affect the way Americans eat, love and die. People can dine on genetically engineered salmon. Women can buy emergency contraceptive pills without prescriptions. Military veterans can design their own headstones.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The administration’s regulatory legacy has become an issue in the campaign to replace Mr. Obama, as Donald J. Trump has sharply criticized regulatory overreach and promised to undo many of the new rules. But executive power has expanded steadily under both Republican and Democratic presidents in recent decades, and both Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton have promised to act in the service of their own goals.\n",
      "The new rules built on the legislative victories Mr. Obama won during his first two years in office. Those laws — the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the $800 billion economic stimulus package — transformed the nation’s health care system, curbed the ambitions of the big banks and injected financial support into a creaky economy. But as Republicans increased their control of Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama’s deep frustration with congressional opposition led to a new approach: He gradually embraced a president’s power to act unilaterally.\n",
      "History may now judge the regulations to be one of Mr. Obama’s most enduring legacies. At the least, his exercise of administrative power expanded and cemented a domestic legacy that now rivals Lyndon B. Johnson’s Great Society in reach and scope.\n",
      "In May, Mr. Obama was asked by a farmer in Elkhart, Ind., to justify the “dramatic increase” in government regulations that affected his business. “I’m not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating,” Mr. Obama responded. “But there are some things like making sure we’ve got clean air and clean water, making sure that folks have health insurance, making sure that worker safety is a priority — that, I do think, is part of our overall obligation.”\n",
      "Infuriated Republicans describe many of the new rules as unwarranted, resulting in “less jobs, less businesses, less prosperity, lower take-home pay,” in the words of the House speaker, Paul D. Ryan. Business groups, also incensed, have challenged a number of new regulations in court, delaying them or preventing them from taking effect. Some economic experts worry that the accumulation of regulation is contributing to the economy’s persistent sluggishness.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“The big issue that I grapple with is that the regulatory state keeps growing,” said Robert Hahn, an economist and a regulatory expert at the Smith School at the University of Oxford. “And as it keeps growing, when does it become too much?”\n",
      "Mr. Obama entered office in January 2009 determined to make his mark by passing bold new laws, not by tinkering with rules. Rahm Emanuel, his first chief of staff, and other top aides mapped out an ambitious two-year agenda that included a health care overhaul, new banking laws, a remake of the federal student loan program, infrastructure spending and stricter limits on pollution.\n",
      "“The president is not somebody who is intuitively or inherently a regulator,” said Howard Shelanski, who followed Mr. Sunstein in that role in mid-2013. He said Mr. Obama conveyed a simple message: “‘If we can get a good result without regulating, let’s do that.’”\n",
      "But after eight years of a Republican administration, many Democrats were eager for the government to lean more forcefully on the levers of regulatory power, and officials within the federal bureaucracy felt emboldened.\n",
      "The White House did resist some ideas. It shut down efforts by Lisa Jackson, Mr. Obama’s first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, to increase the regulation of ozone, a decision that environmentalists viewed as a betrayal.\n",
      "But other rules were allowed to proceed. Kate Hanni, an advocate from Napa, Calif., for the rights of airline passengers, had tried for years to persuade the government to address a series of incidents in which flight delays left passengers trapped for hours on planes that had already left the gate, often in cabins with stinking toilets, weak air-conditioning and no food. The Bush administration put Ms. Hanni on a task force consisting mostly of airline executives, which concluded in the fall of 2008 — over her forceful and repeated objections — that the public was best served by allowing the airlines to make their own decisions.\n",
      "Weeks after the task force released its report, Ms. Hanni was invited to Washington in December 2008 to meet with Robert S. Rivkin, the head of Mr. Obama’s transportation transition team. Democrats in Congress had introduced legislation to address the issue, but Mr. Rivkin asked Ms. Hanni if she would support new regulations instead. She would back anything enforceable, Ms. Hanni said.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Right answer,” he replied.\n",
      "Over the course of the next nine months, Mr. Rivkin and his team of career regulators at the Department of Transportation developed rules prohibiting planes loaded with passengers from sitting on the tarmac for more than three hours.\n",
      "In meetings with Ray LaHood, Mr. Obama’s first transportation secretary, and his staff, airline representatives argued for flexibility, saying rigid timelines would only increase flight cancellations. They chafed at the regulators’ willingness to see the benefits but not the costs.\n",
      "Sharon L. Pinkerton, an executive at Airlines for America, the industry’s main trade group, recalled Transportation Department regulators suggesting that “unquantifiable, unidentifiable benefits” would “outweigh the costs” of new rules for the airlines.\n",
      "“What are we supposed to do with that?” she asked later in an interview.\n",
      "But Mr. LaHood had himself experienced long waits on the runway during frequent trips home to Illinois. Just days before Christmas in 2009, he announced a Passenger Bill of Rights, which for the first time levied fines of up to $27,500 per passenger on airlines that leave domestic flights stranded for more than three hours. He challenged the major carriers to provide their service “in a way that is halfway convenient” for their customers.\n",
      "His department, Mr. LaHood said in a recent interview, had a new sense of purpose, independent of any specific directive from the White House.\n",
      "“They had other fish to fry,” Mr. LaHood said of senior officials at the White House. “We didn’t want to wait around for Congress to take five, 10 years to do this. We could do this by rule and regulation, so we were pretty much off to the races.”\n",
      "Other agencies were moving too. In its second year, bureaucrats working across the government completed 96 major rules, more than in any subsequent year.\n",
      "The White House soon began to take a greater interest in regulation.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Passing legislation to address the problem was unlikely, Mr. Emanuel knew, given entrenched ideological opposition and the White House’s focus on overhauling the health insurance system. But Nancy-Ann DeParle, director of the newly created Office of Health Reform, suggested an alternative: The administration had the power to impose conditions on hospitals that got federal Medicare funding.\n",
      "A year later, the president directed the Department of Health and Human Services to develop regulations requiring hospitals to extend visitation rights to same-sex partners.\n",
      "A focus on similar issues produced more than 100 executive actions and regulatory changes intended to improve the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, particularly after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a woman.\n",
      "People with H.I.V. were no longer barred from entry into the country; federal housing rules recognized lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender families; health insurance companies were barred from discriminating against gay people; labor protections applied to gay couples; married same-sex couples could take family and medical leave; and the Internal Revenue Service started treating same-sex couples no differently.\n",
      "“These are really lasting things,” said David Stacy, the government affairs director for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights advocacy organization. “They affect people in their everyday lives.”\n",
      "As the Obama administration turned toward regulation, it sought to strengthen its hand by changing the estimates of what a life is worth. Those estimates allowed the administration to argue that the benefits of many regulations were greater than previously appreciated. This push was particularly important as a justification for stronger environmental protections.\n",
      "A White House push to pass a sweeping climate change bill in 2009 failed to pass in Congress, but almost from the outset some of Mr. Obama’s aides were working on a Plan B. Mr. Sunstein and Michael Greenstone, the first chief economist of Mr. Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, created an internal task force to put a dollar figure on the cost of carbon emissions.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The government does not try to quantify all the benefits of proposed regulations. When it came to environmental regulations, the calculation was particularly limited. Analysts often assigned a dollar figure to just one kind of damage — emissions of “small particles” — and then stacked up the costs of the proposal against the benefits of fewer particles.\n",
      "The Obama White House has issued hundreds of major regulations in an effort to reshape aspects of American life.\n",
      "Quantifying a second kind of damage, from carbon emissions, would broaden the assessed benefits of new regulations — potentially justifying new and stronger restrictions. In 2010, the administration issued a report that estimated the economic impact of global warming, including agricultural disruptions, increased flooding and health problems. It pegged the cost of carbon emissions at $21 per ton. An updated assessment in 2013 raised the price tag to $33.\n",
      "When the administration announced stricter standards for automobile fuel efficiency in 2011, it cited the reduction in carbon emissions as a key benefit. Those benefits have since been cited in several dozen new regulations, including the hotly debated 2015 rule seeking to restrict emissions from new power plants.\n",
      "Regulators also revisited a more fundamental concept: the value of life. Not just a theological or philosophical abstraction, that figure is used to assess how much spending the government should require to prevent death or injury.\n",

      "The Department of Transportation, for example, increased the estimated value of preventing one death from $6.6 million in 2009 to $9.4 million last year, adjusting for inflation. The department made an even larger adjustment for preventing injuries, for example raising the value of averting a broken arm from $103,000 in 2009 to $442,000 in 2015, also adjusting for inflation. The increases have helped to justify new requirements for stronger roofs and rearview cameras on automobiles and seatbelts on buses.\n",
      "The new carbon cost estimate, in particular, has drawn fire from industry groups who regard it as an arbitrary assessment intended to further an environmental agenda.\n",
      "Mr. Greenstone, in a recent interview, defended the government’s number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced by political pressures.\n",
      "“Our job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not to do science but to summarize the frontier of science,” he said. “ And I feel that we were faithful to that.”\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "By the fall of 2011, after a summer standoff between the two political parties nearly caused a government shutdown, it was clear to Mr. Obama that little hope remained for moving his agenda forward in a Congress controlled by Republicans.\n",
      "Speaking in Las Vegas that October, Mr. Obama expressed disdain for “an increasingly dysfunctional Congress” and pledged: “Where they won’t act, I will.”\n",
      "That sentiment kicked off a slow-moving realignment as White House officials held a series of strategy meetings that fall in the Roosevelt Room, first with Mr. Obama on Saturdays and later with agency and policy experts, usually on Tuesdays and Fridays. Led by Ms. DeParle, who had become deputy chief of staff, and Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, they asked: What can we do without Congress?\n",
      "“It’s certainly true that we learned by about the third year that the answer to every challenge isn’t going to be legislative,” said Cecilia Muñoz, now director of Mr. Obama’s Domestic Policy Council.\n",
      "The pace of regulation stalled somewhat in 2012, amid political concerns about announcing sweeping new regulations during the campaign. In 2013, Mr. Obama’s team briefly hoped his victory would lead to legislative progress, but Republicans blocked gun control measures and an immigration overhaul, and partisan gridlock shut the government down for 15 days that October.\n",
      "In early 2014, the moment was finally ripe. Mr. Obama recruited John D. Podesta, then the head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal research and policy institution, to be his counselor in the White House\n",
      "“The weight, if you will, changed with a very recalcitrant Republican House, and with both the House and the Senate being part of the ‘Nyet!’ caucus,” Mr. Podesta said. “It meant that you had to be seriously concerned with trying to make change happen with the tools that you had available.”\n",
      "In January 2014 a frustrated president stood before Congress and declared “a year of action” — with or without the help of the Republicans arrayed before him.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“Whenever I can take steps without legislation to expand opportunity for more American families, that’s what I’m going to do,” Mr. Obama said in his State of the Union address.\n",
      "Mr. Obama announced an executive order raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for several hundred thousand cooks, janitors and other federal contract workers. In subsequent orders, each resulting in a new regulation, the president required contractors to let their workers take paid sick days and banned discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender workers. He also increased workplace protections for all workers at businesses that held federal contracts — an umbrella covering roughly 29 million workers.\n",
      "“What the president was ultimately doing was holding up the United States government as a model employer,” said Joseph Geevarghese, director of Good Jobs Nation, a union-backed advocacy group that pressed the administration to embrace its regulatory power. “And it created a ripple effect. Within months of the president acting you had private C.E.O.s — Ikea, Gap, Disney, airlines — saying they too were going to boost minimum pay.”\n",
      "The new regulations again required the White House to broaden its assessment of regulatory benefits. During Mr. Obama’s first term, administration officials told Mr. Geevarghese and other activists that the government did not have the power to make such changes. But after Mr. Obama’s re-election, they found a way: White House lawyers concluded that the president could impose requirements on contractors in the interest of taxpayers.\n",
      "Betsey Stevenson, a member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, took the lead in building a case that contractors who paid higher wages would attract and retain better workers, increasing their productivity.\n",
      "The theory holds, for example, that if the lunch lines at a federal office building moved a little more quickly because of more competent, motivated cafeteria workers, every employee in those lines would save a few minutes a day and have more time to work, thus increasing productivity.\n",
      "The idea has its roots in work by George Akerlof, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, and his wife, Janet Yellen, now chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, who decided in the early 1980s to pay their babysitter above-market wages as motivation.\n",
      "With the president’s blessing, the E.P.A. also became more aggressive. The agency asserted federal authority to protect thousands of waterways and wetlands, proposed to cap carbon emissions at new and existing power plants, raised emissions standards for trucks and airplanes, and called for new limits on methane, mercury and ozone.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "“He has been much more ambitious and aggressive on environmental regulation than any other president we’ve had,” said Jeffrey Holmstead, a lawyer pursuing legal challenges to some of Mr. Obama’s signature environmental rules.\n",
      "Courts have now temporarily blocked the administration’s water rules and delayed the power plant limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The next administration will also have considerable leeway to determine how quickly new rules are carried out, and how strictly enforced.\n",
      "Every president promises to prune the federal rule book.\n",
      "Mr. Obama has tried to formalize the process for reviewing existing regulations, and the two candidates vying to take his place, Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump, have nodded at the need to ease the burdens of regulation.\n",
      "But the scope of federal regulation has continued to grow, and the trend is likely to continue. Presidents, both Democratic and Republican, have asserted greater power in recent decades to dictate the shape of regulations, while Congress has become less specific in its instructions.\n",
      "“We live in an era of presidential administration,” Elena Kagan, a Harvard law professor since appointed by Mr. Obama to the Supreme Court, wrote in a 2001 paper that reviewed the expansion of the regulatory state.\n",
      "Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Trump would most likely face significant congressional opposition to their major campaign promises. To sidestep Congress, they now have the legacy of Mr. Obama. Mr. Podesta, now Mrs. Clinton’s campaign chairman, said the appeal of taking action without Congress is hard to resist.\n",
      "“You come in with a strategy of going to the Hill, certainly where you can find some cooperation,” Mr. Podesta said. But when that fails, writing regulations “is a way to get much more substantial throw-weight behind solving the problem.”\n",
      "An earlier version of this article misstated the role of Michael Greenstone on the Council of Economic Advisers. He was its first chief economist under President Obama, not its first head.\n",

      "Even a big-vision idealist like Mr. Licklider could never have imagined that more than 50 years later, we would be telling the internet our deepest secrets and our whereabouts, and plugging in our smartphones, refrigerators, cars, oil pipelines, power grid and uranium centrifuges.\n",
      "And even the early internet pioneers at the Pentagon could not have foreseen that half a century later, the billions of mistakes made along the way to creating the internet of today and all the things attached to it would be strung together to form the stage for modern warfare.\n",
      "It is rare to find a computer today that is not linked to another, that is not baked with circuitry, applications and operating systems and that has not — at one point or another — been probed by a hacker, digital criminal or nation looking for weaknesses to exploit for profit, espionage or destruction.\n",
      "There is plenty of raw material to work with. On average, there are 15 to 50 defects per 1,000 lines of code in delivered software, according to Steve McConnell, the author of “Code Complete.” Today, most of the applications we rely on — Google Chrome, Microsoft, Firefox and Android — contain millions of lines of code. And the complexity of technology is increasing, and with it the potential for defects.\n",
      "The motivation to find exploitable defects in widely used code has never been higher. Governments big and small are stockpiling vulnerabilities and exploits in hardware, software, applications, algorithms and even security defenses like firewalls and antivirus software.\n",
      "They are using these holes to monitor their perceived enemies, and many governments are storing them for a rainy day, when they might just have to drop a payload that disrupts or degrades an adversary’s transportation, energy or financial system.\n",
      "They are willing to pay anyone who can find and exploit these weaknesses top dollar to hand them over, and never speak a word to the companies whose programmers inadvertently wrote them into software in the first place.\n",
      "The leaks revealed a long customer list, including police departments, law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States, Europe and countries like Bahrain, Ethiopia, Sudan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Morocco.\n",
      "But the market for exploitable bugs is much bigger than Hacking Team’s client list, and nations have been paying huge sums to hackers willing to turn over those weaknesses to governments, and withhold them from software companies, for more than 20 years.\n",
      "Once Stuxnet and its motivations were uncovered — first by a security researcher in Belarus and then around the world — a Pandora’s box was opened.\n",
      "Today, more than 100 governments have publicly acknowledged their own offensive cyberwar programs. Countries that were not in the market before Stuxnet was discovered are in it now.\n",
      "Iranian officials now claim to have the third-largest digital army in the world behind the United States and China. Those claims are impossible to verify, in large part because most countries keep such programs secret. But Iranian hackers have made plenty of demonstrations.\n",
      "The next year, Iranian hackers were blamed for a series of attacks on the United States banking system. And while security experts who have analyzed those attacks claim that the Iranians’ abilities are still nowhere near those of the United States and its closest allies, they are steadily improving.\n",

      "We believe that ISIS will remain financially solvent for the foreseeable future. A conservative calculation suggests that ISIS may generate a surplus of $100 million to $200 million this year that it could reinvest in state-building.\n",
      "America’s post-9/11 approach to blocking terrorist financing will not be effective against ISIS because the group uses money as an instrument of statecraft. Its leadership has established institutions that administer an Islamist police state founded under Shariah law. While these institutions provide few tangible services, they consolidate the group’s governing authority by facilitating trade, collecting taxes and maintaining control over the local population.\n",
      "Moreover, ISIS has never relied on basic formal financial institutions, such as banks. Instead, it has tended to reinvest its revenues in its own organization to further its fighting and state-building agendas.\n",
      "President Obama’s decision last week to conduct airstrikes and send humanitarian aid will help buy time for both Iraqi and Kurdish forces to regroup. But Baghdad needs a strategy that aligns the political and economic interests of all Iraqis against ISIS. The group’s center of gravity lies not in the international financial system but within the local economies of Iraq and Syria. Regardless of what limited additional measures America decides to undertake in the coming weeks and months, there are three possible Iraqi policies that could help turn the tide.\n",
      "If Iraq succeeds in replacing Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, as now seems likely, the new unity government should decentralize power and distribute a larger portion of the national budget to Sunni-majority areas. Baghdad should also work to strike deals with local Sunni tribes and business owners where ISIS has not yet taken control. These Sunni leaders would cooperate in squeezing ISIS out of local markets in exchange for subsidies and other direct government economic assistance.\n",
      "Second, America could help the Iraqis and the Kurds analyze ISIS financial information collected in raids and from informants, and then use that information to plot a strategy and to plan operations.\n",

      "James B. Lee Jr., a towering figure on Wall Street, was remembered at his funeral Mass on Monday as a father, a friend and an investment banker possessed of boundless energy, sprawling interests and a crackling wit, qualities that made him one of the most successful and beloved figures in his industry.\n",
      "The service, in St. Patrick’s Cathedral in Midtown Manhattan, was just blocks from where Mr. Lee worked as vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase. There, he shaped corporate America, and the nation’s biggest bank, through a career that established him as perhaps the pre-eminent deal maker of his generation.\n",
      "After graduating from Williams College — which he supported and championed through the years — Mr. Lee began working at Chemical Bank in 1975. As the banking industry consolidated, Mr. Lee rose through the ranks through a succession of mergers. In 2000, he became vice chairman at JPMorgan Chase.\n",
      "The Fire Department of New York bagpipers played “Amazing Grace” to begin the Mass on a sunny first full day of summer, and Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan presided over the funeral Mass amid the scaffolding erected inside St. Patrick’s, which is in the midst of a substantial restoration.\n",
      "“In business, you were brilliant, a shining star, one of the best we’ve seen,” JPMorgan’s chief executive, Jamie Dimon, said in delivering the first eulogy. “You were a nuclear power, a sun of positive energy, you had unbridled enthusiasm and optimism. Your deal-making was legendary. You were simply a huge influence on the success of so many of us.”\n",
      "Mr. Dimon choked up as he recounted how Mr. Lee had supported him when he battled throat cancer last summer. Mr. Lee came into his office every day, gave him a hug and whispered into his ear, “You know, I love you like a brother,” Mr. Dimon recalled.\n",
      "Mr. Lee was remembered as much for his dedication and love for his family, and especially his grandchildren, as he was for his business successes.\n",
      "Mr. Lee’s younger daughter, Elizabeth, known as Izzy, shed tears while reading from Ecclesiastes 3, a passage that Mr. Lee sent her when she was upset over the death of a friend. Mr. Lee’s older daughter, Alexandra, known as Lexi, read a passage on sudden loss from the Book of Wisdom.\n",
      "Mr. Lee’s only son, James, was visibly moved. His father had served as the best man at his wedding. Among the touching moments James recalled was how his father left notes for his children before catching the 5 a.m. train to work each morning. And other less serious times involved practicing guitar for performances with his rock band of JPMorgan employees, called the Bank Notes.\n",
      "“He was a star, he was a superstar, and he went out at the top of his game,” the younger Mr. Lee said.\n",
      "Mr. Lee pioneered the syndicated loan market — in which multiple banks cooperate to lend money to a single client to finance a major transaction. This innovation allowed Mr. Lee to become the go-to financier for corporate chieftains looking to strike transformative multibillion-dollar deals as well as for private equity heads seeking leverage for their big debt-laden buyouts of public companies.\n",
      "And even though many on Wall Street nowadays aim to appear humble after the financial crisis, Mr. Lee remained unapologetically a brash investment banker, wearing slicked-back hair, blue shirts with white collars and chunky cuff links.\n",
      "“I’m sure that the Lord is, as we speak, adjusting to this new force of nature in Heaven,” Mr. Dimon said. “You’re probably asking why it took six days to create the earth, and was it absolutely necessary to rest on the seventh. And I’m sure you think Heaven would be a little more effective, if they merged some of the various religions.”\n",
      "Mr. Lee possessed a powerful intellect and a deep understanding of the financial world’s mechanics, but was also known to win over clients with showy displays, buying hoodies for the Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and a Corvette to demonstrate his loyalty to General Motors.\n",
      "“They never said that he was soft, or he was easy or he was someone people could bamboozle,” said the Rev. Robert T. Ritchie, who knew the Lee family well. “He was determined. He was dogged. He was organized.”\n",
      "Mr. Lee was also remembered for as a generous spirit who championed diverse causes, not just his alma mater, but also underprivileged youths, and emergency and military personnel.\n",
      "“When you come for judgment, God is not going to ask you ‘What was your position at JPMorgan, what was your bank account like, did you give money to your church?’ ” asked Father Ritchie.\n",
      "St. Patrick’s recently was scene of the funeral Mass for Cardinal Edward M. Egan. Other notables who have been remembered in the grand gothic cathedral include Babe Ruth, Robert F. Kennedy and Andy Warhol.\n",
      "“This is where we New Yorkers come, Catholics and all faiths, in moments of loss and difficulty and heartache,” Cardinal Dolan said. “So you are all very much at home here this morning.”\n",

      "It’s hard to imagine a tax code more complicated than the one we already have.\n",
      "Hillary Clinton has come up with one.\n",
      "“This isn’t tax reform,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, an economist who served as director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum, a conservative, pro-growth advocacy group. “It’s anti-reform. She’s layering on even more complexity.”\n",
      "His views were echoed by a number of tax experts I spoke to this week about Mrs. Clinton’s tax plans, as I did earlier about Donald J. Trump’s.\n",
      "In Mrs. Clinton’s favor, all the experts I interviewed said her proposals were more detailed, transparent and consistent than Mr. Trump’s and, even more important, would not blow open an estimated $10 trillion hole in the federal budget over a decade, as Mr. Trump’s proposals would.\n",
      "“It has the important virtue of being fiscally responsible,” Leonard E. Burman, director of the centrist Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, said of Mrs. Clinton’s plan. “It doesn’t make our long-term fiscal problems worse.”\n",
      "To varying degrees, all agreed that Mrs. Clinton’s proposal would increase taxes on the rich and big business but that it would add so many new layers of complexity that it would, above all, be a huge boon for tax lawyers. “There’s a lot of new complexity,” said Mr. Burman.\n",
      "Although Mrs. Clinton’s plan is intended to make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more than they now do, it leaves intact loopholes that allow wealthy real estate developers like Mr. Trump to pay little or no tax, which could serve as a vehicle for sophisticated tax lawyers to exploit.\n",
      "David Kamin, an outside adviser to the campaign on tax and budget issues and an associate professor at New York University School of Law, said that the campaign was “taking a close look” at provisions benefiting people like Mr. Trump, and that her proposals did not purport to cover every loophole she might seek to close or change as president.\n",
      "As for complexity, “broadening the base and closing loopholes for the wealthy inevitably involve a certain amount of administration,” said Mr. Kamin, who emphasized that her proposals would simplify returns for small businesses and people with modest tax burdens.\n",
      "The experts generally praised Mrs. Clinton’s proposals to benefit small businesses, which include a provision that would allow them to immediately deduct up to $1 million in capital investments, which would ordinarily have to be depreciated. (Mr. Trump has also called for immediately deducting capital investments, but on an even wider scale.)\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton has been frank in her acknowledgment that to pay for the many new social programs she has proposed, she needs to raise revenue, which she plans to do primarily through a tax increase on the rich.\n",
      "The Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution estimates that Mrs. Clinton’s tax plan would raise $1.1 trillion over the next decade; the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the more conservative Tax Foundation puts the figure at $498 billion, assuming no reduction in economic output from the tax increase.\n",
      "Nearly all the increase would come from new taxes on the wealthiest Americans. For those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $5 million, she would impose a 4 percent surcharge on top of the normal tax system. For those with incomes above $1 million, she would install a 30 percent effective tax rate, a version of what has become known as the “Buffett rule” after Warren E. Buffett, the billionaire investor, complained that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary. Mrs. Clinton’s plan would also cap the tax value of deductions and exemptions at 28 percent and raise the estate tax.\n",
      "She would also close the notorious “carried interest” loophole that primarily benefits hedge fund operators and private equity managers, and, unlike Mr. Trump, not give it back by means of tax cut on the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of it.\n",
      "The Tax Policy Center estimates that the top 1 percent of taxpayers — those with adjusted gross incomes of more than $750,000 — would face an average tax increase of $78,000, while the lower 95 percent — those earning less than $300,000 — would face little or no increase.\n",
      "But over all, Mrs. Clinton has shied away from a sweeping tax overhaul. “It‘s more tinkering at the edges,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation’s policy center. “I wouldn’t call it reform. There aren’t any major reformulations to make the code simpler or fairer. It’s basically just a tax increase” for the top income bracket.\n",
      "It goes without saying that raising taxes on the rich while leaving most of the existing tax code intact is anathema to Republicans and conservative economists, as well as many centrist Democrats who have long held dreams of a bipartisan “Grand Bargain” to carry out a sweeping tax overhaul to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the American economy.\n",
      "“I have admiration for the mechanics” of the Clinton proposals, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. “They’re more detailed and structured than Trump’s. But I have serious concerns about the quality. Their philosophy seems to be to give up on economic growth and try to deliver middle-class prosperity by taking from the rich.”\n",
      "Everyone I interviewed criticized as fiendishly complicated and ineffectual what is probably Mrs. Clinton’s most innovative proposal, which is to put in place a graduated scale for tax rates on capital gains.\n",
      "Under Mrs. Clinton’s plan, taxpayers reporting capital gains held for one to two years would pay their ordinary income tax rate, which currently goes as high as 39.6 percent, just as they do now for gains held less than a year. Gains of two to three years would be subject to a 36 percent rate, and after that the rate would decline by four percentage points each year until it reached the current long-term rate of 20 percent. (All rates exclude the additional 3.8 percent surtax on net investment income.) In effect, there would be seven rate brackets for capital gains, compared with two under the current code.\n",
      "Although this nominally raises capital gains rates for some assets, it is not clear what, if any, effect it might have on overall revenue. The Tax Foundation estimates that it would cost the Treasury $374 billion over 10 years because it would encourage investors to hold assets longer, which would defer their taxes. The Tax Policy Center says it would depress revenue in the early years as investors delayed sales, but would eventually add $84 billion over 10 years.\n",
      "But the goal is not revenue; it’s supposed to curb “activist” investors and others focused on short-term results, and persuade corporate executives to manage for the long term rather than for quarterly profit, according to a speech Mrs. Clinton delivered at New York University in July 2015.\n",
      "However laudable the goal, using the capital gains tax “is a misguided approach,” said Mr. Burman (a view echoed by everyone I interviewed).\n",
      "“There’s no empirical evidence whatsoever this would have any effect on management decision-making,” Mr. Burman said. “The real issue is corporate governance. It would be better if management faced more, not less, pressure from investors.”\n",
      "How did such an arcane proposal, likely to appeal to a tiny sliver of voters, even make it into Mrs. Clinton’s tax plan?\n",
      "Ms. Tanden, a close confidante and former campaign worker for Mrs. Clinton, succeeded the Clinton campaign manager John Podesta as president of the Center for American Progress, the think tank that published the paper. Mr. Effron is a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a Wall Street private equity and investment banking firm. Mr. Effron is also a major donor and fund-raiser for the Clinton campaign and has been mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a Clinton administration.\n",
      "“Secretary Clinton believes that American businesses need to break free from the tyranny of today’s earnings report so they can focus on innovating and investing for the long term,” said Mike Schmidt, an economic policy adviser at the Clinton campaign. “That’s what this proposal is designed to advance.”\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton’s proposals also do nothing to address the corporate tax rate, which, at 35 percent, is the highest in the developed world (though few companies actually pay anywhere near that rate). President Obama called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent in a compromise rebuffed by Republicans, but Mrs. Clinton would leave it at 35 percent and try to extract even more revenue by closing various loopholes.\n",
      "“You’d think the business community would be up in arms over this, but I haven’t heard a peep,” said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. “The focus on personalities has driven this off the radar.”\n",
      "Several experts cautioned, as did the Clinton campaign itself, that Mrs. Clinton’s tax proposals might well evolve after the election should she become president.\n",
      "Details aside, Mrs. Clinton’s tax proposals offer a stark alternative to Mr. Trump’s and send a clear message that a top priority “is increasing the tax liability at the top,” Mr. Kamin said.\n",
      "“The message is, that has to be a key element of any progressive tax reform. Beyond that, she has other priorities as well, such as simplifying taxes for small businesses and tax relief for working families,” he added. “But these are the key priorities, not a comprehensive list of every detail in the tax code that needs reform.”\n",

      "Just days after employees at NFL Network were accused of sexual harassment, the Carolina Panthers said Friday that the team had begun an investigation into “allegations of workplace misconduct” made against the team’s owner, Jerry Richardson.\n",
      "“The Carolina Panthers and Mr. Richardson take these allegations very seriously and are fully committed to a full investigation and taking appropriate steps to address and remediate any misconduct,” the statement said.\n",
      "The investigation into Richardson brings a broadening focus on workplace harassment to the heart of the country’s wealthiest and most powerful sports league. While he has assumed a lower profile recently, Richardson for years traveled in the inner circle of the league’s business. He is the lone former N.F.L. player within the league’s ownership fraternity.\n",
      "The Panthers announced that the team had hired the law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan to look into the accusations against Richardson, and that Erskine Bowles, a Clinton administration official and a minority owner of the team, would oversee the investigation.\n",
      "It is unclear how independent the investigation will be because it is being led by a team stakeholder who is presumably close to Richardson. In other investigations of sports franchise owners, the league itself has taken the lead, such as when the N.B.A. looked into racist remarks made by Donald Sterling, then the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers.\n",
      "Bowles was the White House chief of staff for President Bill Clinton in 1997 and 1998, when an investigation began into Clinton’s sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, who was a White House intern.\n",
      "Richardson has served on many of the influential owners’ committees, and he played a large role in ending the N.F.L. lockout in 2011. In 2015, he was at the center of the league’s handling of domestic violence allegations. He announced the Panthers would not re-sign defensive end Greg Hardy — who had been suspended by the league and convicted of domestic violence, though the conviction was later overturned. Richardson explained the decision simply: “We do the right things.”\n",
      "The investigation into Richardson was first reported by ESPN.\n",
      "N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell said Wednesday at an owners meeting in Dallas that the league would investigate the claims in the lawsuit.\n",
      "The N.F.L. updated its personal conduct policy in 2014, expanding the guidelines and penalties to cover not just players, but all employees. The league also set up its own investigative unit to look into claims of misconduct off the field.\n",
      "Joe Lockhart, an N.F.L. spokesman, declined to comment on the investigation involving Richardson.\n",
      "Richardson, 81, has largely dropped out of view in the past two years. The turning point came when the league’s owners voted to let the Rams move from St. Louis to Los Angeles in 2016. He had recommended that the Oakland Raiders and the San Diego Chargers be allowed to move there. (The Chargers moved to Los Angeles this year.)\n",
      "“We should not manage to avoid criticism, but work passionately to provide positive outcomes,” Richardson wrote. “Nothing less should be expected or accepted.”\n",

      "The Post found that in the 2014 primary, blacks made up 48 percent of voters compared to 51 percent “other.” In the general election, which included a referendum on legalization of marijuana that brought many young white voters to the polls, blacks were 46 percent to 53 percent “other.”\n",
      "In the event of a future racially polarized Democratic mayoral primary pitting a major black candidate against a major white candidate, Hispanics would be in a position to determine the outcome.\n",
      "There are some indications of how Hispanic voters might cast their ballots. The February 1989 Chicago mayoral primary provides perhaps the most relevant case study.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "In an email, Piston wrote that the “findings constitute suggestive evidence” that in a white vs. black election, Hispanics could provide “a victory for the white candidate, because Latinos tend to view whites more favorably than blacks.”\n",
      "Piston cautioned, however, that the policies espoused by the white and black candidates could also play a crucial role:\n",
      "Latinos are more egalitarian than whites and more comfortable with big government. If the black candidate was to the left of the white candidate in the scenario you describe with respect to these two core values, and if Latinos voted with these two core values in mind, this would draw Latinos on balance to the black candidate.\n",
      "I contacted a number of politicians, operatives, researchers and political scientists to get their assessment of the likelihood that the District will elect a white mayor and got a mixed response.\n",
      "I see no reason why the city can’t elect a white mayor. While I in no way think we are in a post racial era, I do believe that most of the citizens of the city would have no genuine bias on this issue. In fact, the younger folks who have made up most of the city’s growth spurt are far more welcoming of differences than their elders. Like any successful mayoral candidate, the politician would have to speak to issues relevant to those in the city with a plan to tackle crime, affordable housing and continue the improvement in the business climate to achieve job growth, etc. but I certainly think it could be done.\n",
      "Matthew Green, a political scientist at Catholic University, said the prospect of a white mayor is “absolutely, clearly possible.” He noted that major sections of the city have been transformed, in most cases resulting in more whites:\n",
      "The city has been changing pretty dramatically. There are neighborhoods I don’t even recognize anymore.\n",
      "There are, however, some dissenters.\n",
      "Garry Young, director of the Center for Washington Area Studies at George Washington University, downplayed the possibility that Washington could elect a white mayor, noting that\n",
      "African-American’s remain the largest racial group in the District with close to 50 percent. Non-Hispanic whites still only make up a tad more than one third.\n",
      "Young also pointed out that\n",
      "The dynamic that seems in play now is you have black candidates who attract the business community and white voters in Northwest and then do well enough among black and Latino voters elsewhere to win the Democratic primary. That’s a proven winning strategy. Could a white candidate put together the same sort of coalition? Possibly — and one day probably as I think the District’s continues to become whiter — but I think it’s still a long-shot in the short run.\n",
      "Hal Wolman, a political scientist at George Washington put an entirely different spin on the question:\n",
      "One of the biggest differences is on the question whether blacks and white have the same opportunities for jobs: 74 percent of whites say yes compared to 40 percent of blacks. Another major difference is on the question of whether the American system of justice is biased against African-Americans. Blacks say it is, by 68 to 26, while 69 percent of whites say the system in not biased, and 25 percent say it is.\n",
      "Despite the particular demographic profile of the District, the population trends in Washington are emblematic of shifts taking place in a number of major cities.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "The geographic movement of African-Americans will produce a shift in black political power from some cities to surrounding suburbs and to states in the South.\n",
      "Georgia, for example, is a state where Democrats are making gains, so much so that the Clinton campaign is considering a possible drive to win what has been a solidly red state. The slow but steady increase in the percentage of Georgia residents who are minorities is crucial to this process.\n",
      "By far the dominant trend, however, is the migration of African-Americans from center cities to the suburbs.\n",
      "metropolitan areas in the growing parts of the country are registering the greatest numeric gains in suburban black population. The suburbs of Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Dallas experienced the largest increases in black population during 2000-2010.\n",
      "Advertisement\n",
      "Driving the movement of African-Americans to the suburbs, Frey wrote,\n",
      "are the young, those with higher education, and married couples with children — attributes that characterized white suburbanization for almost a century.\n",
      "Politically, the migration out of cities to the suburbs will lead to some diffusion of black political power, but not necessarily to a diminishment.\n",
      "Over time, African-Americans in the Washington metropolitan area may be forced through demographic change to cede some power in the District, which has a population of 672,228. At the same time, African-American control of Prince George’s County might be an avatar of a deeper transformation. The county not only has a population of 909,535, but it also has a member of Congress who can actually vote, unlike the District’s quasi-congressional representation. By most standards, this is not a bad deal.\n",
      "A focus on the black-white-Hispanic urban splits can serve to obscure what is possibly a more salient development: the ongoing political alignment of well-educated, relatively well-off whites with racial and ethnic minorities. It is this racially and ethnically diverse urban-metropolitan coalition that currently supports Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party and that elected Barack Obama twice. It is viscerally opposed to Donald Trump.\n",

      "it’s clear that densely populated urban areas with a lot of young people such as Hackney and Islington in London voted overwhelmingly to remain in the European Union.\n",
      "Most large urban centers elected to stay part of the European Union, particularly in London, where many local authorities delivered vast majorities for the pro-EU campaign.\n",
      "There is an ongoing struggle, then, for cultural as well as economic resources, within rapidly transforming metropolitan-urban centers — just as there is a struggle for broader forms of power between regions and between countries. As both traditional and cosmopolitan values form the basis of alliances that sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate, the opportunities for a peaceful reshaping of coalitions on both the left and the right are there. But as conflicts related to economic and social modernization erupt at locations as far apart as Ferguson and Falluja, the potential is also clear for ever more dangerous conflict.\n",

      "WASHINGTON — The Trump administration finally crossed the line for some members of Congress this week, provoking bipartisan umbrage and accompanying pledges to hold top officials accountable.\n",
      "Many thought the day had been far too long in coming. Few thought the galvanizing issue would be weed.\n",
      "“I am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the state of Colorado and their rights,” said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, a conservative member of the Republican leadership who has rarely broken with the Trump White House.\n",
      "He was not the only unhappy Republican. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement that she had repeatedly discouraged Mr. Sessions from taking action on marijuana, a move that she called regrettable and disruptive.\n",
      "Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a leading Trump ally in the House, said the decision would deny relief to suffering cancer patients, including children. He said the move by Mr. Sessions was “heartless and cold, and shows his desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people. He should focus his energies on prosecuting criminals, not patients.”\n",
      "“Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision bulldozes over the will of the American people and insults the democratic process under which majorities of voters in California and in states across the nation supported decriminalization at the ballot box,” she said. “Yet again, Republicans expose their utter hypocrisy in paying lip service to states’ rights while trampling over laws they personally dislike.”\n",
      "She and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said they would try to use a pending spending package to prevent Mr. Sessions from following through on the plan to overturn an Obama-era policy that made marijuana prohibition a low priority for law enforcement. Mr. Leahy noted that such a provision had previously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with support from both parties.\n",
      "Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a longtime opponent of offshore drilling who could be facing off against Mr. Scott in a high-profile Senate contest, immediately jumped on the issue.\n",
      "“This plan is an assault on Florida’s economy, our national security, the will of the public and the environment,” Mr. Nelson said. “This proposal defies all common sense, and I will do everything I can to defeat it.”\n",
      "At the White House, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the administration did not intend to start a fight with Mr. Scott but would not shy away from one either.\n",
      "“Just because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn’t mean that we can’t still have an incredibly strong and good relationship,” she said. “We’ll continue those conversations with him and hopefully all come to an agreement.”\n",
      "As for the president’s evolution on marijuana, Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump “believes in enforcing federal law. That would be his top priority, and that is regardless of what the topic is.”\n",
      "“The people of Colorado spoke — they spoke loudly,” Mr. Gardner said on the Senate floor. “And I believe if the same question were asked today, they would have even more support for the decision they made back several years ago. I agree with President Trump, that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado.”\n",
      "But the legalization of marijuana has proved to be a job-creating, tourist-attracting, vote-getting success in certain states, with more entertaining the idea. The attorney general and the president may find resistance to their pot policy to be much more potent than they anticipated.\n",

      "It’s hard to imagine a tax code more favorable to real estate developers than the one we already have.\n",
      "Donald Trump has come up with one.\n",
      "But Mr. Trump’s new tax proposal doesn’t just preserve those breaks, it piles on new ones for real estate developers like Mr. Trump himself — at an estimated cost of more than $1 trillion in tax revenue over a decade.\n",
      "Moreover, this doesn’t count Mr. Trump’s more general tax cuts, which deliver the biggest windfalls to the highest earners. Many real estate developers would reap further gains from those provisions if they became law.\n",
      "Even conservative Republican tax experts have denounced the specific real estate measures Mr. Trump has outlined.\n",
      "Let’s start with carried interest, a much-criticized tax loophole that allows private equity operators, hedge fund managers and real estate partners to convert ordinary income into capital gains, which are taxed at a lower rate.\n",
      "Wealthy hedge fund managers and private equity partners like the former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have attracted much of the criticism for exploiting the loophole, but the concept originated with real estate developers long before hedge funds were commonplace.\n",
      "Instead of taking a fee for their management services (which would be taxed as ordinary income) people who earn carried interest take a percentage of assets under management and a percentage of the eventual profits, a formula often described as “two and twenty.” The percentage of profits is taxed at the lower capital gains rate.\n",
      "In what at first might seem a laudable effort to put the public interest ahead of his own financial gain, Mr. Trump called for abolishing the loophole. “We will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers,” Mr. Trump said in Detroit on Aug. 7.\n",
      "But his fellow real estate investors and the Wall Street interests he lambastes needn’t worry. He’s offering them an even better tax break that renders carried interest irrelevant.\n",
      "Mr. Trump has proposed a new rate — 15 percent on all corporate and business income — that is lower than the current capital gains rate of 20 percent on profits from the sale of assets, which is already well below the top tax rate on ordinary income of around 40 percent. The new lower rate would apply to “pass-through entities,” according to Mr. Trump’s plan, “Tax Reform That Will Make America Great Again.”\n",
      "While they can be found in all sectors of the economy (including private equity and hedge funds), they are especially prevalent in real estate. Mr. Trump identified 564 separate business entities in his financial disclosure forms, most of them L.L.C.s and partnerships.\n",
      "That amounts to a huge tax cut even for people who had been paying taxes on carried interest at the preferential rate, “since most carried interest is generated by a business entity,” said Alan Cole, an economist at the Tax Foundation’s Center for Federal Tax Policy. The center warned last year, before Mr. Trump’s latest revisions, that his overall plan could cost over $10 trillion in reduced tax revenues over 10 years, depending on how it is calculated.\n",
      "“The rich who already benefit from carried interest will get a big tax cut,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin agreed.\n",
      "The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimated that lowering the rate on business income from pass-through entities to 15 percent would cost $1 trillion over 10 years.\n",
      "Mr. Trump already benefits from enormous depreciation benefits, which allow active real estate developers like him to use paper losses to offset other earned income. Mr. Trump’s proposals go even further, allowing for immediate write-offs rather than spreading them over several years.\n",
      "“We will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments,” he said in Detroit.\n",
      "The idea of immediately expensing capital investments rather than writing them off over time has many supporters among tax experts, including the Tax Foundation and Mr. Holtz-Eakin. Among other things, it simplifies the calculations and in theory would promote capital spending at a time it’s been lagging.\n",
      "But few, if any, support expensing capital investments while also allowing an interest expense deduction.\n",
      "That’s because the combined deductions provide a reason to borrow even when it doesn’t make economic sense. As a simple example, consider a landlord’s $1,000 investment in a new garage door for a rental property. Someone who borrows $900 at 5 percent would spend just $100 out of pocket, but could deduct $900 plus interest, or $945, generating a large tax loss. Even assuming Mr. Trump’s favorable business tax rate of 15 percent goes into effect, the tax benefit ($142) is greater than the cash spent, creating a purely tax incentive.\n",
      "Here’s what the 2005 President’s Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform under President George W. Bush concluded: “Allowing both expensing of new investments and an interest deduction would result in a net tax subsidy to new investment,” the report found. “Projects that would not be economical in a no-tax world might become viable just because of the tax subsidy. This would result in economic distortions and adversely impact economic activity.”\n",
      "Every other proposal to expense business investments, including the House Republican plan, limits interest deductions.\n",
      "Eliminating the interest deduction “will generate an enormous amount of kvetching out of highly leveraged investors, real estate developers among them,” said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. “I have no sympathy for that. If your business model depends on interest deductibility, that’s not a business, it’s a tax shelter.”\n",
      "Mr. Trump hasn’t explicitly addressed whether interest payments should remain deductible, as they are now, but various advisers have said he supports maintaining the deduction. (The Trump campaign didn’t respond to my requests for comment.)\n",
      "“Trump is a debt king,” said Mr. Rosenthal. “He’s made a living from deducting interest. He’s never going to give that up.”\n",
      "The changes and inconsistencies in Mr. Trump’s tax reform proposals have left many experts scratching their heads. “Trump has no overarching principle that I can identify,” said Mr. Holtz-Eakin. “I want a tax code to express values. It should be about something,”\n",
      "That leaves it open to speculation that Mr. Trump’s plan is mostly about himself and other wealthy real estate developers. It’s hard to tell for sure, since he hasn’t released his tax returns.\n",
      "If, as I’ve suggested, he pays little or no tax because he can use the existing tax code to reduce his taxable income to near zero, or even a loss, his proposals that extend even more breaks to developers might have relatively little impact on his own tax obligations.\n",
      "Still, to the degree they would reduce his tax rate to 15 percent and accelerate depreciation while maintaining the interest deduction, they would ensure that Mr. Trump — and most of his friends on Wall Street who would be well positioned to exploit his new loophole — would never pay anything close to the 33 percent top rate he’s now proposing for his fellow Americans.\n",

      "The president also continues to insist that he could decide to renominate the Fed’s chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, whose four-year term ends in February.\n",
      "On Friday, the president took to Instagram to advertise that he would announce his pick next week. “People are anxiously awaiting my decision as to who the next head of the Fed will be,” Mr. Trump said in a video. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. And I have somebody very specific in mind. I think everybody will be very impressed.”\n",
      "The choice of a Fed chairman is always a high-stakes political decision, but Mr. Trump’s predecessors uniformly sought to minimize the attendant drama. Past presidents have rarely acknowledged the existence of multiple candidates, and since World War II, every chairman who completed a first term has been nominated for a second term.\n",
      "Mr. Trump, by contrast, announced in July that he was considering candidates to replace Ms. Yellen. The White House later confirmed the names of five finalists, and then Mr. Trump said publicly he had narrowed his focus to Mr. Powell and Mr. Taylor.\n",
      "On Tuesday, he conducted an informal poll of Senate Republicans, asking them to raise a hand for either Mr. Powell or Mr. Taylor. Some refused.\n",
      "“I don’t think that’s a very good way to pick a Fed chair, so I declined to participate,” said Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, an increasingly outspoken critic of Mr. Trump’s style of governance.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump sought advice from a TV personality, turning the tables on Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network in the middle of an interview.\n",
      "“Tell me who your preference is,” Mr. Trump said. He pressed repeatedly for an answer from the visibly flustered host. Mr. Dobbs finally endorsed Ms. Yellen.\n",
      "Mr. Trump responded: “She was very impressive. I liked her a lot. I mean, it’s somebody that I am thinking about.” But, he continued, “I have to say you’d like to make your own mark,” suggesting that he might be inclined to nominate someone else.\n",
      "Sarah Binder, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the most unusual aspect of Mr. Trump’s deliberations was the diversity of the candidates.\n",
      "Presidents generally decide what kind of chairman they want and then pick a nominee.\n",
      "President Jimmy Carter, who chose twice, first decided that he wanted an industrial executive, settling on G. William Miller, the head of Textron. Nearly 17 months later, deciding he wanted someone respected by financial markets, Mr. Carter picked Paul Volcker.\n",
      "President Ronald Reagan renominated Mr. Volcker, then chose Alan Greenspan, draining the drama from the process for almost two decades. In 2003, President George W. Bush offered Mr. Greenspan a fifth term a year before the end of his fourth term.\n",
      "When Mr. Greenspan retired in 2006, Mr. Bush chose Ben S. Bernanke from a list of three Ivy League economists who had served as Republican policy advisers.\n",
      "“If you’re taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell, well, that’s light-years away from Taylor,” Ms. Binder said. “It just raises the question: What is the basis on which the president is conducting the search?”\n",
      "One possible explanation is that Mr. Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment. He has repeatedly praised Ms. Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman. The economy is growing and the stock market is rising, and Mr. Trump wants both trends to continue. But conservatives are pressing Mr. Trump to seize the opportunity to shift the approach of the central bank by appointing Mr. Taylor.\n",
      "Three House Republicans, including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio, sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed. Republicans want to constrain the Fed’s conduct of monetary policy, and to install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts to reduce financial regulation.\n",
      "Some of Mr. Trump’s advisers, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, favor the nomination of Mr. Powell as a kind of middle road: a Republican likely to maintain the Fed’s course on monetary policy, but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulation.\n",
      "Ms. Binder said that replacing Ms. Yellen would reinforce the growing tendency to view the Fed as a partisan political institution, with every president picking a new chairman.\n",
      "“If anything is being broken here, it’s the norm of bipartisan continuity at the Fed, and it is always to the Fed’s benefit to look bipartisan and to be bipartisan,” she said. “It raises fewer questions about what is motivating the Fed’s choice of monetary policy.”\n",
      "But Peter Conti-Brown, a legal studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is writing a political history of the Fed, said that Mr. Trump was simply making explicit the longstanding reality that presidents seek to influence the course of monetary policy.\n",
      "Indeed, Mr. Conti-Brown said he saw a silver lining in Mr. Trump’s showmanship, and in the diversity of the candidates, because it was providing a rare opportunity for the public to compare and debate different views of the Fed’s role in the economy.\n",
      "“I think it’s all to the very good to generate discussion about what the Fed is, what the different approaches are, whether they’re good or bad,” he said. “This is the only time the public gets to weigh in. If you don’t think the Fed should operate in the shadowy corners of the administrative state, this is exactly what accountability looks like.”\n",

      "NEW YORK — It's a scary but sometimes necessary way to operate — with only a few clients, and perhaps just one. But what if any of those customers leave in a short time span, erasing a significant chunk of revenue?\n",
      "\"We are reliant on a few large clients, and it is the key concern that keeps me up at a night,\" says Brian Cairns, CEO of ProStrategix, a management consulting group and Cairns Consulting, a marketing company, based in New York.\n",
      "Cairns was a subcontractor several years ago to his biggest marketing client, who would funnel business to him. But when her company ran into problems, his work dropped off.\n",
      "Many small business owners, including consultants, publicists and architects, have only a handful of customers or clients at a time. If they work solo or have just a few employees, they can't take on more work. And small manufacturers that turn out custom products for other companies or for the government may have just those few customers.\n",
      "There are upsides: It's less complicated when an owner doesn't have a lot of accounts to juggle. But it makes a business more vulnerable. Owners find they need strategies to be sure they survive a revenue dip. Cairns' solution was to launch ProStrategix, so he'd be less dependent on one customer.\n",
      "Having a few clients gives Joanne Sonenshine's consulting group time to focus on their specific needs, but \"there is a fear that if one or two go away, we are in a serious financial conundrum,\" she says. Sonenshine's company, Connective Impact, works with nonprofits on projects that can last from a few months to a few years. She takes on three to six at a time.\n",
      "But because Sonenshine's concerned about losing business, she networks, blogs, uses social media and attends conferences. \"I am constantly in business development mode,\" says Sonenshine, whose company is based in Arlington, Virginia.\n",
      "When Gayle Bu networks, she offers potential clients a free 30-minute consultation — but not necessarily with the expectation of being hired. Bu, who's based in Atlanta, is an online business manager, working with companies and individual entrepreneurs.\n",
      "\"Even if you're not the right fit, they will tell their network about you,\" Bu says. She's most comfortable with four to six clients — and knows what it's like to lose two, one right after the other.\n",
      "\"It was a pain in the neck, but it wasn't devastating because I knew I just needed to call a couple of people and fill those slots next week,\" Bu says.\n",
      "That approach is the key to surviving, says Gene Marks, owner of The Marks Group, a small business consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania.\n",
      "\"You should be thinking all the time, 'If I were fired on Friday, what is Plan B,'\" he says.\n",
      "Owners may not have to look too far for more work, he says. Those who have contracts with one office or division of a large business can do some prospecting in other parts of the company. Marks also recommends that owners keep overhead low and cash flow strong, giving themselves a cushion if a customer suddenly leaves.\n",
      "Staying alert to both positive and negative changes with customers is also key. When Toys R Us said in March it was shutting its stores, for instance, it didn't come as a surprise to vendors, Marks says. \"They knew where things were going six months ahead,\" he says.\n",
      "Business owners who focus on government work deal with the occasional unpredictability of getting paid. When the federal government shut for 16 days in 2013, contractors including many small business owners faced a cash flow nightmare.\n",
      "Psychologist Ashley Hampton has run into that doing evaluations of children and adults for a state agency in Alabama. When agencies approach the Sept. 30 end of their fiscal year, they start running out of money.\n",
      "\"What typically happens is in mid-July or mid-August it starts slowing down and then in August it becomes a trickle and in September, non-existent,\" says Hampton, who's located in Trussville.\n",
      "To help make up for the shortfall, Hampton has expanded her geographic reach to 15 counties. She's also building a separate coaching business for other owners who are trying to build companies.\n",
      "Some owners start out with many customers, then realize they would work better with just a few. Brian Foley used to rely on thousands of people who used his app, Buddytruk, which he describes as an Uber for people who need trucks for pickups and deliveries. But advertising costs to reach the general public ran too high, especially since individual customers tended to use it once in a while at most.\n",
      "Two years ago, Foley began focusing on deliveries for shoppers at stores like Costco in Southern California and Austin, Texas. People who buy big items like patio furniture can get a truck to deliver their purchases.\n",
      "Foley, whose company is based in Santa Monica, California, develops and maintains relationships with store managers and employees so he can advertise Buddytruk to customers while they're shopping. If a manager were to leave, there's a chance he could lose his company's presence in a store and in turn, thousands of dollars in revenue each month.\n",
      "\"That's definitely a worry of ours. The longer the relationship lasts, the more of a moat you create around yourself,\" Foley says.\n",

      "Mr. Duterte, whose colorful and unpredictable comments have drawn comparisons to Mr. Trump, late last month named the chairman of Century Properties Group, Jose E. B. Antonio, as an envoy to Washington for trade, investment and economic affairs, Philippine news outlets reported. Word of the appointment became public this week.\n",
      "Stock in Century Properties rose 20 percent on Wednesday on the Philippine Stock Exchange on the news that Mr. Trump had been elected.\n",
      "Mr. Antonio’s assignment is to enhance business ties between the two countries. A decade ago, he served as a special envoy to China. He could not be reached for comment.\n",
      "In a statement released by Martin Andanar, the communications secretary, Mr. Duterte congratulated Mr. Trump on his victory.\n",
      "“President Duterte wishes President-elect Trump success in the next four years as chief executive and commander in chief of the U.S. military, and looks forward to working with the incoming administration for enhanced Philippine-U.S. relations anchored on mutual respect, mutual benefit and shared commitment to democratic ideals and the rule of law,” the statement said.\n",

      "One boundary that Seymour Durst, the second-generation patriarch of the business, always longed to push was the south.\n",
      "“It’s getting harder and harder to do office construction,” Ms. Durst said during a recent tour of the tower. “Housing is so much more valuable now, even in Midtown, it’s taking over.”\n",
      "Joining the divergent strands of the family’s business — offices and housing — is a first for the Dursts.\n",
      "With space running out in sought-after areas, what better solution than to stack one atop the other? In the case of Eos, this means about 375 rental apartments over 122,000 square feet of office space and 49,000 square feet of retail space.\n",
      "“The housing definitely makes the commercial more feasible,” said Ms. Durst, the chief administrative officer.\n",
      "Mixed-use development has long been a dream of city planners, who see it as a way to promote density, a crucial need as cities worldwide continue to swell.\n",
      "Crowding is what first dispersed these uses in New York, just as it is now bringing them back together. In the early part of the 20th century, the growth of dirty garment factories around the expensive shops and fine residences of Fifth Avenue spurred the creation of the zoning code, and commercial and residential spaces became more segregated.\n",
      "Such developments are not unheard-of in Manhattan, though zoning quirks tend to stifle variety. One of the earliest modern examples of mixed-use development is Trump Tower.\n",
      "When shops began fleeing Fifth Avenue in the 1970s, the city permitted developers, who preferred to construct housing, to build bigger structures if they included commercial uses. This allowed Donald J. Trump to create a five-story atrium that is home to Gucci’s flagship store, as well as many campaign rallies for Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee for president. Above the atrium are 26 floors of offices and 39 floors of apartments.\n",
      "More recent examples include the 72-story CitySpire, built in 1987 on West 56th Street, where the first 23 floors are dedicated to offices; and the Bloomberg Building on Lexington Avenue, which houses the headquarters of the financial news service.\n",
      "There may, however, be a disconnect between downstairs businesses and billionaire tenants. “Do you really think people like Steven A. Cohen are shopping at the Home Depot,” Mr. Chakrabarti said, referring to the hedge fund manager whose penthouse at the Bloomberg tower was once on the market for $115 million.\n",
      "The Dursts did not always plan to create a mixed-use building.\n",
      "In 2010, the Durst Organization, in partnership with Fetner Properties, bought the debt then foreclosed on the 855 Avenue of the Americas property, then owned by the Brooklyn developer Joseph Chetrit. For two years, the developers considered building a hotel, but eventually turned to Seymour Durst’s office space idea. Fetner is no longer involved in the project.\n",
      "“When we first started this project, people thought we were crazy to include office space,” Ms. Durst said.\n",
      "Last year, Nike agreed to rent all of the 122,000 square feet of office space on the second through sixth floors.\n",
      "Residents and workers have separate lobbies, elevator cores and terraces. Both sets of tenants do share at least one thing: the basement gym. There, Nike is working with the Dursts to build a basketball court and outfit gym equipment so professional athletes can test new gear in the same spaces frequented by weekend warriors and part-time yogis.\n",
      "“You need treadmills that go a lot faster,” said Julia Limongello, the project manager for Eos, as she stood in the unfinished gym over the summer. “You’ll see a lot more 50-pound dumbbells.”\n",

      "“I am obligated to the people of Colorado to take all steps necessary to protect the state of Colorado and their rights,” said Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, a conservative member of the Republican leadership who has rarely broken with the Trump White House.\n",
      "He was not the only unhappy Republican. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said in a statement that she had repeatedly discouraged Mr. Sessions from taking action on marijuana, a move that she called regrettable and disruptive.\n",
      "Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, a leading Trump ally in the House, said the decision would deny relief to suffering cancer patients, including children. He said the move by Mr. Sessions was “heartless and cold, and shows his desire to pursue an antiquated, disproven dogma instead of the will of the American people. He should focus his energies on prosecuting criminals, not patients.”\n",
      "“Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s decision bulldozes over the will of the American people and insults the democratic process under which majorities of voters in California and in states across the nation supported decriminalization at the ballot box,” she said. “Yet again, Republicans expose their utter hypocrisy in paying lip service to states’ rights while trampling over laws they personally dislike.”\n",
      "She and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said they would try to use a pending spending package to prevent Mr. Sessions from following through on the plan to overturn an Obama-era policy that made marijuana prohibition a low priority for law enforcement. Mr. Leahy noted that such a provision had previously passed the Senate Appropriations Committee with support from both parties.\n",
      "Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida and a longtime opponent of offshore drilling who could be facing off against Mr. Scott in a high-profile Senate contest, immediately jumped on the issue.\n",
      "“This plan is an assault on Florida’s economy, our national security, the will of the public and the environment,” Mr. Nelson said. “This proposal defies all common sense, and I will do everything I can to defeat it.”\n",
      "At the White House, the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said the administration did not intend to start a fight with Mr. Scott but would not shy away from one either.\n",
      "“Just because we may differ on issues from time to time doesn’t mean that we can’t still have an incredibly strong and good relationship,” she said. “We’ll continue those conversations with him and hopefully all come to an agreement.”\n",
      "As for the president’s evolution on marijuana, Ms. Sanders said Mr. Trump “believes in enforcing federal law. That would be his top priority, and that is regardless of what the topic is.”\n",
      "“The people of Colorado spoke — they spoke loudly,” Mr. Gardner said on the Senate floor. “And I believe if the same question were asked today, they would have even more support for the decision they made back several years ago. I agree with President Trump, that this decision should be left up to the people of Colorado.”\n",
      "But the legalization of marijuana has proved to be a job-creating, tourist-attracting, vote-getting success in certain states, with more entertaining the idea. The attorney general and the president may find resistance to their pot policy to be much more potent than they anticipated.\n",

      "But the White House counsel, Donald McGahn (pronounced “McGann”), refused to send the order to the Justice Department, which would have had to carry out any firing. Removing Mueller, McGahn told other White House officials, “would have a catastrophic effect” on Trump’s presidency. As McGahn expected, Trump then backed down.\n",
      "I would caution people not to lionize McGahn. He’s been involved in some of this administration’s seedier acts, including the nomination of unqualified federal-judge candidates, at least one of whom had personal ties to him. He also played a role in previous attempts by the White House to muck up the Russia investigation, including the firing of James Comey as the F.B.I. director.\n",
      "But McGahn acted honorably and bravely when it mattered most. He flat-out refused an order from his boss, which is never easy, let alone when your boss is the president and the order deals with the most explosive subject in politics. He doesn’t deserve to be lionized, but he does deserve praise.\n",
      "Unfortunately, other Republicans may soon find themselves facing the same decision as McGahn did. Trump has recently been offering conciliatory words about the investigation, but there is every reason to think he is afraid of it — and willing to do almost anything to obstruct it. Here’s hoping other Republicans show the same courage as McGahn.\n",

      "The classification also means that veterans — many of whom rely on the federal Veterans Affairs Department for their health care — cannot get coverage for medical marijuana, even in the 29 states that have legalized it.\n",
      "“Even in the states where it’s legal, there’s still the stigma associated with the federal ban,” said Louis Celli, the group’s national director of veterans affairs and rehabilitation. He noted that soldiers were regularly subjected to urinalysis and told to stay away from the drug. “It puts veterans in a very difficult position.”\n",

      "TUCSON — As the police chief here, I’m deeply troubled by the Trump administration’s campaign against “sanctuary cities,” which refuse to turn over undocumented immigrants to federal authorities. Washington is trying to retaliate against them by withholding funding for things like crime prevention, drug treatment and mental health programs.\n",
      "Tucson is not technically a sanctuary city. But we are close to the border with Mexico and take pride in being welcoming to immigrants. Yet the government has warned us that our grants are in danger.\n",
      "The Justice Department could be playing a key role in building on the Obama-era policing reforms that many of my fellow police chiefs strongly support. Instead, the changes it wants to make — to force local police officers to cooperate much more closely with federal immigration authorities — will compromise public safety by reducing community confidence in law enforcement.\n",
      "To be sure, violent crime has risen in some cities over the past couple years. But the administration’s response, paradoxically, is shortsighted policies that hurt local law enforcement agencies. An associate deputy attorney general, Steven Cook, recently explained the department’s rationale this way: “It is unfortunate that cities like Chicago are more interested in implementing their extreme sanctuary policies that put criminal aliens back on the street than in addressing violent crime.”\n",
      "That couldn’t be farther from the truth. Public safety has always been our top priority.\n",
      "The message from Washington is that cities need to refocus on “law and order.” Yet the harsh anti-immigrant rhetoric and Mr. Sessions’s reckless policies ignore a basic reality known by most good cops and prosecutors: If people are afraid of the police, if they fear they may become separated from their families or harshly interrogated based on their immigration status, they won’t report crimes or come forward as witnesses.\n",
      "When crime victims and witnesses are unwilling to testify because they’re afraid an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent will be waiting to arrest them at the courtroom doors, real criminals go unpunished. It means drug dealers and people who commit domestic and sexual violence are free to exploit a voiceless class of victims; such criminals become a threat to us all.\n",
      "It’s a simple formula. When crimes go unreported and unsolved, criminals are empowered.\n",
      "Most law enforcement professionals agree that “sanctuary city” designations mean little from a policing standpoint. Almost all local law enforcement agencies, regardless of the “sanctuary” or “immigrant-welcoming” policies adopted by their jurisdictions, cooperate with federal authorities to go after drug cartels, human traffickers and transnational gangs.\n",
      "Yet these designations can serve a legitimate purpose: They make clear that everyone in our community has a role in preventing and reducing crime. And they send a message to all members of the public, whether they have immigration documents or not, that the police are first and foremost there to protect them.\n",
      "The Justice Department wants Americans to believe that recent upticks in violent crime are tied to undocumented immigrants or cities’ failure to “get tough on crime.” The facts don’t support this narrative. The reality is, cities with fewer crime-fighting resources often experience increases in crime. Crime also may increase in places where crime victims and witnesses are fearful of working with law enforcement.\n",
      "Mr. Sessions talks a great deal about the need to preserve “local control,” yet he wants to dictate how local police agencies interact with their undocumented immigrant populations. The Trump administration seems to think it knows more about fighting crime than local police chiefs and sheriffs, and it is punishing cities that keep their officers focused on community needs rather than federal immigration enforcement.\n",
      "Tucson has come too far to jeopardize reforms that strengthen relationships with the public we serve. Justice Department grants and other federal support funded through our taxes should not be tied to immigration policies.\n",
      "Holding the needs of state and local law enforcement hostage to politics ultimately works against the interests of safety and justice.\n",

      "And those who do their best to steer clear of politics aren’t safe, either. Enjoy Taylor Swift these days — I do! — and you may be taken to task by some sourpuss griping about the singer’s refusal to state her partisan allegiance on Instagram.\n",
      "This is not to say that we should condone our artists when they say something truly heinous. But, all things considered, I’d rather live in a culture where artists feel free to leap or trip over the line of what’s acceptable rather than one in which the smallest misstep puts careers and reputations at risk.\n",
      "Leonard Cohen, who I had the pleasure of writing about and the privilege of knowing, understood this point intimately. Speaking to the Jewish community of Montreal in 1964, long before he first picked up a guitar and stepped onto a stage, Cohen explained that he was committed to following his art wherever it led him. Most people, he said, scandalizing the squares in attendance, would rather just visit lifeless objects in sterile museums rather than follow their muse into some jungle, running the risk of getting bitten by something wild. Cohen was never afraid of the risk, and it made him a great artist.\n",

      "A house may be large or small; as long as the neighboring houses are likewise small, it satisfies all social requirement for a residence. But let there arise next to the little house a palace, and the little house shrinks to a hut.\n",
      "In it, you are asked to choose between living in a 4,000-square-foot house where all the neighbors have 6,000-square-foot homes or living in a 3,000-square-foot house where all the others are 2,000 square feet.\n",
      "The most common choice, Frank reported, was the 3,000-square-foot house. Even though a 4,000-square-foot house has more room in absolute terms, the 3,000-square-foot house has more relative value compared with its neighbors.\n",
      "Housing is a positional good: we get additional satisfaction from a larger house not only because a larger house is better in absolute terms, but also because a larger house is better is relative terms. That is, we get additional satisfaction from having more house than the Joneses next door. Trouble is, the Joneses are no different, and when they too work harder to fund their own bigger house, our relative satisfaction gain disappears. We are now merely keeping up with the Joneses.\n",

      "Their wages have stagnated or declined; the ascendance of minorities has threatened their cultural dominance; and the growth of an increasingly large and affluent upper middle class has pushed goods and services once viewed as theirs by right beyond their reach.\n",

      "As Frank explained in Vox last year:\n",
      "The median new house in the U.S. is now 50 percent larger than it was in 1980, even though the median income has grown only slightly in real terms. Houses are growing faster than incomes because of a process I call “expenditure cascades.”\n",
      "In an email exchange with me, Frank observed that\n",
      "For those who are not absolutely poor, the central economic question is, “Do we have enough income to achieve our goals?” The answer depends to a significant extent on the spending of other families in the community. Most families want to send their children to good schools, for example, but a family’s ability to achieve that goal depends on how much other families are spending on housing. That’s because school quality is an inescapably relative concept.\n",
      "The problems of positional status and relative deprivation are fueled by income inequality, Frank argues:\n",
      "A family at the median income level would reasonably aspire to send its children to schools of at least average quality. But to do that, it would have to buy or rent a house near the median of its city’s housing price distribution. And that’s become significantly harder to do.\n",
      "In effect, the increase in the resources commandeered by the overclass has pulled the rug out from under the once upwardly mobile white working class.\n",
      "Housing is a key example of the rising cost of positional goods, but there are many others. “Most families reasonably aspire to host a reception for their daughter’s wedding that guests would remember as special,” Frank writes in the Vox piece, but “the inflation-adjusted cost of the average wedding in the U.S. was $31,000 in 2015, up from about $10,000 in 1980.”\n",
      "Crucially important is the fact that rising inequality constitutes a double whammy. It raises the cost of sought-after goods and it increases the economic gap between the working class and the affluent, spurring nostalgia for what was (even if what was really wasn’t).\n",
      "Growing income inequality in the U.S. has meant that as those at the top are able bid up the price of valued goods like housing and access to good schools, those in lower groups have struggled to maintain their positions.\n",

      "Over the last year, Jessica Dimson, a photo editor on the Politics desk of The New York Times, has helped lead a team of photographers in covering 50 primaries and caucuses, 21 debates and countless campaign events. Ms. Dimson, who graduated from Yale, joined the Times in 2011, working as a photo editor on the Metro and National desks. Prior to The Times, she was a photo editor at Departures and Vanity Fair.\n",
      "What makes a great political photograph?\n",
      "A great political photograph has the qualities of any great photograph — an evocative confluence of aesthetic, emotional and historical elements. But one of the unique challenges of political photography is that the subject matter is often familiar, so a photograph that is surprising, sophisticated, analytical or subtle can really elevate a political photo.\n",
      "Campaign stops often are highly-restrictive, stage-managed events, so any photo that penetrates that or goes beyond what a campaign wants you to see is important. And often those photographs are not of the candidate themselves. There is magic in the periphery.\n",
      "Why do we commit so many resources to covering the presidential campaign photographically? There are many wire service photographers from A.P., Reuters and others at every event and we can use their photos. Why do you want a New York Times photographer too?\n",
      "There are a lot of great wire photographers on the trail, but I think what we bring something different than the wires.\n",
      "A hallmark of Times political photography is that we encourage our photographers to take risks in how they document the campaign. That is reflected both in what they shoot and what we decide to publish. Also, many of our photographers have covered presidential campaigns before. They understand the rhythms and the dynamics and they bring a context to what’s come before 2016. I think that is invaluable.\n",
      "I think we want our photographers to be reporters as well.\n",
      "That is what they do every day on the trail. They’re not just documenting what’s happening in front of the camera, but bringing context and nuance to the coverage.\n",
      "We have many experienced staff photographers in the campaign this year but also several freelance photographers who work regularly for us. What traits do you look for in a potential campaign photographer?\n",
      "We have a number of very talented freelancers on the trail this year, some of whom are photographing a presidential campaign for the first time.\n",
      "I give this recommendation to anyone who is new to working with us: We know what the candidate looks like.\n",
      "That is a signal that we want you to take risks, and it’s O.K. to shoot to the right if all of the photographers standing next to you are shooting to the left. Don’t follow the pack. And we do not expect every photo to be of the candidate and welcome a less literal approach.\n",
      "What’s involved in supervising The New York Times photographic coverage of campaigns?\n",
      "It’s part editor and part facilitator. A lot of my job is looking at and selecting images, but a lot of time is also devoted to handling the logistics — which photographer is traveling with a candidate, keeping track of the candidate schedule (at one time there were 20 candidates, so there was a lot to juggle), helping photographers move from point A to point B and making sure we meet deadlines.\n",
      "I speak with photographers on the road about what they are seeing out there — they are reporters as well as photographers — and give guidance about what we might be interested in on a particular day. But I don’t direct how or what should be photographed — our photographers dictate that. And sometimes I’m just there to listen. They are often working 18-hour days and it’s taxing out there on the road.\n",
      "There are also more than 20 political reporters, and I’m working alongside them to conceptualize ways that we can best illustrate their stories.\n",
      "Is it difficult to get access for our photographers?\n",
      "There are challenges with both campaigns. As a news organization, we always want more access to the candidates. They are on an extensive job interview with the entire country, and we believe that we should be able to fully document that process and all that comes with it.\n",
      "The term the ‘campaign trail’ is a bit of a misnomer this year — the reality is that both Clinton and Trump often fly in for a single event in a day, speak for 20 minutes, and fly out right after. There are no bus tours or diner stops. In some cases, we are relegated to shoot from literal pens in the back of an auditorium. That is frustrating and we speak up about that. So there is an ongoing conversation about access with the campaigns.\n",
      "So your first presidential national party conventions are coming up. How do you plan for something like this?\n",
      "This is no small undertaking. We have about 10 photographers traveling to Philadelphia and Cleveland, and all of our staff photographers who are going have covered conventions in past years. Some will spend most of their time covering the action inside the arena, while others will be dedicated to covering and tracking protests and the scene outside.\n",
      "Events like these are where The Times really excels at giving readers an unvarnished and immediate sense of what is transpiring. We have the ability to transmit photographs very quickly, often in a matter of seconds, and can then publish them on our site and to social media platforms — including Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram — a few seconds after that. I won’t attempt to explain all of the in-depth technical aspects because I’m lucky to work with people who understand it better than I do and make it all happen, but we have hard-wired lines at various spots in the arena and photographers will filing directly from their cameras. There are other aspects involving power supplies, routers, and remotes, but I leave that to the experts.\n",
      "I will be in the arena editing photos as they come, and another photo editor on the politics desk, Morrigan McCarthy, will be onsite as well. Tanner Curtis, who works on the National desk, will be editing in New York.\n",
      "We can adjust our coverage based on how things transpire over the next two weeks. We’re very nimble in that way. We also have photographers who are going to be traveling with each candidate before their arrival at their respective convention.\n",
      "The Times often gets complaints about coverage, often by both sides of an issue or a presidential campaign. What does fairness mean in visual political coverage?\n",
      "Fairness is of paramount importance to us, and if you view our coverage in totality over the course of the last 15 months, I think you will find that we are balanced in how we represent the campaigns visually. We are mindful not just of which images run, but also how they run — the context in which an image is published, the prominence of a particular story, is it a news item or a more analytical piece — all of those are factors in our decision.\n",
      "This is a particularly polarizing election and readers may have strong feelings about certain images. Politics is a very personal issue for most people, and I welcome the dialogue — differing interpretations of a photograph are valuable and essential to the medium. For the most part, when we do get feedback it has been very positive. I think that our audience values a less-traditional approach to our visual coverage.\n"

      "In the change that is likely to be most noticeable to fans, the time-honored ritual of throwing four pitchouts for an intentional walk is no more. Managers will now merely signal the umpire, and the batter will take his base.\n",
      "So no more of this:\n",
      "Baseball also responded to complaints about the speed of the replay system with several changes. Managers will now have only 30 seconds to decide whether to make a replay challenge, which will make it more difficult for them to quickly study video before making their decision.\n",
      "The replay officials will now have a two-minute time limit to make their decisions, although the league said there would be “various exceptions,” which makes you think the five-minute replay delay is not extinct.\n",

      "“We couldn’t even make an agreement on limiting the number of times somebody goes to the mound,” he said.\n",
      "Among the changes that will not be made, though they very likely would have made a real impact on the pace of the game, were limits on players’ calling timeouts, a pitch clock and limits on pitching changes.\n",
      "Commercial time between innings will also remain the same, as expected.\n",
      "The new rules in full:\n",
      "■ The start of a no-pitch intentional walk, allowing the defensive team’s manager to signal a decision to the home plate umpire to intentionally walk the batter. After the signal of the manager’s intention, the umpire will immediately award first base to the batter.\n",
      "■ A 30-second limit for a manager to decide whether to challenge a play and invoke replay review.\n",
      "■ When a manager has exhausted his challenges for the game, crew chiefs may now invoke replay review for non-home run calls beginning in the eighth inning instead of the seventh inning.\n",
      "■ A conditional two-minute guideline for replay officials to render a decision on a replay review, allowing various exceptions.\n",
      "■ A prohibition on the use of any markers on the field that could create a tangible reference system for fielders.\n",
      "■ An addition to Rule 5.07 formalizes an umpire interpretation by stipulating that a pitcher may not take a second step toward home plate with either foot or otherwise reset his pivot foot in his delivery of the pitch. If there is at least one runner on base, then such an action will be called as a balk under Rule 6.02(a). If the bases are unoccupied, then it will be considered an illegal pitch under Rule 6.02(b).\n",
      "■ An amendment to Rule 5.03 requires base coaches to position themselves behind the line of the coach’s box closest to home plate and the front line that runs parallel to the foul line before each pitch. Once a ball is put in play, a base coach is allowed to leave the coach’s box to signal a player so long as the coach does not interfere with play.\n",

      "(Reuters) - U.S. cable operator Comcast Corp is asking investment banks to increase a bridge financing facility by as much as $60 billion so it can make an all-cash offer for the media assets that Twenty-First Century Fox Inc has agreed to sell to Walt Disney Co for $52 billion, three people familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n",
      "Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts only plans to proceed with the bid if a federal judge allows AT&T Inc's planned $85 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc to proceed, the sources said. The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.\n",
      "Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox's film, television and international businesses, giving the world's largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.\n",
      "Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own. In doing so, it topped an earlier offer for the entirety of Sky by Fox.\n",
      "Last November, Comcast offered to acquire most of Fox's assets in an all-stock deal valued at $34.41 per share, or $64 billion, a regulatory filing showed last month. Like Disney, Comcast sought to buy Fox's entertainment networks, movie studios, television production and international assets, the filing shows.\n",
      "Fox ended up announcing an all-stock deal with Disney for $29.54 per share. In the regulatory filing, Disney and Fox cited regulatory hurdles as reasons to reject Comcast's bid, even though they did not reference it by name.\n",
      "The exact value of Comcast's new bid for the Fox assets is not yet clear, although the $60 billion in new financing indicates it is seeking significant firepower to outbid Disney. Comcast already has a $30 billion bridge loan to finance its Sky offer.\n",
      "The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Comcast, Fox and Disney declined to comment.\n",
      "Fox shares rose 5.13 percent to $39.99 on the news in after-hours trading in New York on Monday. Comcast shares were down 1.5 percent to $31.90, while Disney shares were down 0.5 percent to $102.00.\n",
      "Murdoch, who owns close to a 17 percent stake in Fox and holds about 40 percent of the voting power, prefers to be paid in stock rather than cash for the Fox assets, because this makes the transaction non-taxable for shareholders, sources have said. It is not clear how receptive he would be to an all-cash offer.\n",
      "Last month's regulatory filing also showed that Fox viewed Disney's stock as more valuable than Comcast's, based on historic prices, and felt that a deal between Disney and Fox would generate greater long-term value. The Roberts family controls Comcast through a dual-class stock structure.\n",
      "Comcast's stock has dropped since then, from around $38 to about $32 now, giving the company a market capitalization of $149 billion.\n",
      "Disney has committed to share buybacks as a way of returning cash to Fox shareholders. As a result, Comcast sees an opening in being disruptive to the deal by making an all-cash bid, according to the sources.\n",
      "In its deal with Disney, Fox agreed to separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly listed company that it will spin off to its shareholders.\n",

      "MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO, Va. — The United States Marine Corps is looking for a few more good women.\n",
      "And this time the campaign is a bit different. Marine recruiters are turning to high school girls’ sports teams to find candidates who may be able to meet the corps’ rigorous physical standards, including for the frontline combat jobs now open to women.\n",
      "The Marine commandant, Gen. Robert B. Neller, says he wants to increase the number of women in the corps to 1 in 10.\n",
      "“I’ve told them that 10 percent is where we want to go and they’re working on it,” General Neller said in an interview. “Go recruit more women. Find them. They’re out there.”\n",
      "For years, only about 7 percent to 8 percent of the corps, which numbers 184,200, has been women. It is the smallest percentage of women among all the military services. But after the Pentagon’s decision to allow women who qualify to serve in combat jobs, thousands of new infantry, armor and other frontline posts are now open.\n",
      "General Neller said he wants to see women in some of those posts. That order now rests with Maj. Gen. Paul Kennedy, the head of the Marine Corps’ recruiting command.\n",
      "General Kennedy is aggressively recruiting women for the service. He is sending targeted mailings, changing advertising to better represent female Marines, and traveling the country to meet with coaches and female athletes who may be well-suited for the rigors of Marine service.\n",
      "In particular, General Neller believes female wrestlers are good candidates.\n",
      "“We looked at that and said, ‘Wow, that’s kinda what we’re looking for,’” he said. “They’re disciplined, they’re fit, they’re focused on their mission.”\n",
      "According to General Kennedy, the Marines, for the first time, are mailing recruitment literature to thousands of high school girls. Updated advertising will show active-duty female Marines doing their jobs on the battlefield.\n",
      "“The biggest complaint that we’ve heard and we’re reacting to is that we were showing women in some of our material — whether it’s commercial or print or whatever — and they were always training,” General Kennedy said. “And that was a mistake.”\n",
      "Already he has gone to the Women’s Basketball Coaches Association conference and has targeted wrestling and other sports gatherings this year.\n",
      "In those sessions, he said, he is working to debunk misconceptions about women in the Marine Corps, including worries about sexual harassment and sexual assault, limits on career options, lack of stability and difficulties with balancing family life.\n",
      "“We got to talk to them, got to show them there are plenty of female married officers and enlisted, that it’s not a good ol’ boys club anymore when you talk about the career issues,” General Kennedy said in an interview in his office at Marine Corps Base Quantico, Va.\n",
      "The other military services attract far more women, and may be viewed as more receptive than the Marines, whose slogan used to say it was looking for “a few good men.” The current slogan is more inclusive: “The Few. The Proud. The Marines.”\n",
      "The Air Force has the highest percentage of women serving on active duty, with more than 19 percent, followed by the Navy at 18.6 percent, the Army at 14.4 percent and the Marines at 7.9 percent, according to Defense Department data from May.\n",
      "The key, General Kennedy said, is to reach influencers — parents, coaches — and to convince them that their daughters and athletes will be treated fairly. And he said he allays fears that women would be forced into combat jobs they do not want.\n",
      "The recruiters, however, know it will not be easy. Data suggests they have to contact twice as many potential applicants to find a female candidate as they would to find a man. So far, very few are interested in the combat jobs.\n",
      "In a Chicago suburb, Maj. Shanelle A. Porter, the commanding officer of Recruiting Station Chicago, said most women coming in the door just want to be Marines, but so far two women have said they were looking for frontline roles.\n",
      "The women, she said, want to be pioneers.\n",
      "“They’re looking for that challenge,” Major Porter said. “They’re trying to show we can do it, too.”\n",
      "A Marine for 13 years, Major Porter participated in college and professional sports — running the 400 meters — for seven years. Her goal is to make sure that any female recruit she sends to training is ready.\n",
      "Some cannot do a pull-up or hang from a bar for long enough. And sometimes they need to become faster, so they can finish the 1.5-mile run in 13.5 minutes.\n",
      "All female recruits, she said, go on a “high-risk action plan” for at least five months that includes vitamin supplements, weight management and an exercise regimen that includes weights, cross-fit training and a pull-up program.\n",
      "For General Kennedy, having a female Marine like Major Porter available to talk to female recruits and their families is helpful. Women make up 165 of the corps’ 3,565 recruiters, and five of the 48 recruiting station commanders. For now, he says, that is sufficient.\n",
      "“They don’t actually need a female recruiter,” General Kennedy said, adding that the first person a potential recruit meets in a high school or a shopping mall does not have to be the same gender.\n",
      "“There has to be a female in the process,” he said. “At some point, you’ve got to have a woman that can answer the specific questions and maybe even answer the parents’ questions.”\n",
      "Already, he is having some success and is on track to send enough women to boot camp this year to hit 8.7 percent of the annual recruits, or about 3,100 women. The 10 percent goal would require him to bring in about 3,400 women recruits a year; he believes that is well within reach.\n",
      "“We’re going to exceed the goal that was set for us. I feel confident,” said General Kennedy. “I think we can blow through 10 percent like it’s an elevator stop.”\n",

      "MARBLEHEAD, Mass. — When José Luis Ugarte, the oldest sailor to finish the Vendée Globe yacht race, finally arrived back on terra firma in 1993, he soberly pronounced the solo, round-the-world race “an inhuman event” that should be done no more than “once in a lifetime.”\n",
      "But here is Rich Wilson, back for more at age 66 and in position to break Ugarte’s age record by two years. After placing ninth in his first Vendée Globe in 2009, Wilson, an asthmatic American educator from this yachting hub near Boston, will again set sail alone from France on Sunday. Taking nearly three months to complete, the Vendée Globe remains a singular test of character that allows no stops or outside assistance and too few hours of sleep as the weeks and months pass by along with the swells and storms.\n",
      "“The last time, I slept two times in that race for four hours straight, and both were accidental,” Wilson said last week in a Skype interview from France. “They had a 120-decibel alarm clock on the boat, and I slept through that, and that sort of defines the fatigue.”\n",
      "A chain saw, by the way, typically registers 110 decibels, but there was more delight than dread in Wilson’s voice last week as he prepared to depart with the 28 other competitors from the Atlantic port of Les Sables d’Olonne.\n",
      "“The Vendée Globe,” Wilson declared, “is the greatest sailing race in the world.”\n",
      "There is certainly nothing nautical that rivals it in France, where the Vendée, a quadrennial event that began in 1989, remains a major cultural happening, one capable of inspiring Sunday sailors and lifelong landlubbers alike and of appealing to the adventurous and iconoclastic niches in the French psyche. Despite a growing international contingent, a Frenchman has won every edition of the race.\n",
      "The start is one of the great spectacles in sports, as each of the 60-foot yachts is towed out to sea through a narrow channel lined with hundreds of thousands of spectators. Then, quite abruptly — after the cheers and the commotion — there is solitude, or at least a modern approximation of it, with all the satellite phones and other means of communication now at offshore sailors’ disposal.\n",
      "“The first trans-Atlantic passage I did, our communication was through ham radio,” Wilson said. In that race, he said, communication with anyone involved muscling a simple antenna up the mast and hoping for the best.\n",
      "“The way it is now changes it, certainly, but I don’t think it’s a bad thing,” Wilson said. “I think you get to maybe tell the stories a little bit more immediately to whomever it is you are going to tell them to. And I think it allows other people to participate in your adventure.”\n",
      "This year, his website will be translated into English, French and two forms of Chinese.\n",
      "“With the partners we have, we certainly have the potential to reach two or three million students,” he said, up from about 250,000 for the last race, all of them in the United States.\n",
      "Wilson and Pettengill, then trying to break the San Francisco-to-Boston record in the 60-foot trimaran Great American, capsized on Thanksgiving Day in a ferocious storm with sea heights of 65 feet and winds of 85 knots. The crippled vessel was soon thrown upright, its mast broken. Wilson and Pettengill were rescued 17 hours later in the middle of the night, jumping onto a rope ladder lowered by the container ship’s crew.\n",
      "“Quite often those things end in tears afterward because you can’t get them on board because the conditions are too tough or they go in the water and you lose them,” Lister said in a telephone interview from Nelson, New Zealand. “To have even found them in the daylight would have been quite a feat. Finding them in the middle of the night was astounding.”\n",
      "Twenty-six years later, Wilson still gets emotional discussing the rescue, which has led to a deep and enduring connection with Lister. In 2010, Wilson flew to New Zealand to be a surprise guest at Lister’s retirement party.\n",
      "It has not been lost on Lister that his saving Wilson’s life has hardly kept Wilson from continuing to risk it at sea.\n",
      "“I must admit after he did the first Vendée Globe, I said, ‘Don’t try it again — you’re getting too old,’” Lister said. “But his fitness level is still as good as it was then.”\n",
      "With improvements in technology and safety in recent years, the Vendée Globe has become as much a sports event as an adventure. François Gabart, a cerebral and telegenic Frenchman, won the last race in a record 78 days 2 hours 16 minutes. That was 31 days faster than the first winner, Titouan Lamazou, in the 1989-90 race.\n",
      "No sailor has died during the Vendée since the Canadian Gerry Roufs was lost at sea in 1997, but it remains undeniably extreme.\n",
      "“You make a misstep, and the consequences can be dire,” Wilson said. “If something breaks, the loads on the boats are immense, and the systems are complex. There’s just an awful lot that can go wrong.”\n",
      "Wilson added: “The equipment might have gotten safer, but the ocean hasn’t. You are still out there in King Neptune’s domain, and King Neptune is decidedly the one in charge.”\n",
      "After his first Vendée, Wilson confessed that he seriously had no desire to go sailing again. He spent time with his mother, an intrepid soul in her own right who had lived in Alaska in the 1940s. But after Wilson attended the start of the 2012-13 race, he decided he would aim for 2016.\n",
      "In 2015, he resumed his fitness work with Marti Shea, an endurance athlete and leading cyclist based in Marblehead, who also helped him prepare for his first Vendée. She has focused on leg strength and balance because round-the-world sailors’ legs tend to atrophy during the long voyage. She also has designed agility exercises for Wilson in which he must climb over and under three-foot hurdles to mimic the cramped conditions on board during the race.\n",
      "“Compared to the normal person in the population, he’s really fit,” Shea said. “Compared to the other sailors, he definitely cannot be as strong as the younger guys, and he knows that. But that’s where his experience comes into play. Last time, he was not expected to come in ninth place. He had an old boat. But people kept dropping out, equipment breaking, and he kept making the right decisions.”\n",
      "Wilson’s performance in his last race has clearly given his generation ideas. Three other sailors over 60 are in this race: Enda O’Coineen, 61, of Ireland; the Vendée veteran Nandor Fa, 63, of Hungary; and Pieter Heerema, 65, of the Netherlands.\n",
      "Wilson will be the oldest ever to start the race. If he completes it, he will surpass Ugarte, who was 64 in 1993, as the oldest to finish. But this Vendée Globe also has the youngest competitor in the event’s history: the 23-year-old Swiss sailor Alan Roura, who has developed a bond with Wilson.\n",
      "“I told him that I’m three times as old as you are, but we have the same dream,” Wilson said. “So we’ve gotten to be pretty good friends with that concept. I don’t think you can go off on the Vendée Globe without knowing exactly why you’re out there and having a really good reason to be out there.”\n",
      "For Wilson, it is about testing his limits, but above all about teaching while testing his limits. In that sense, with the website and lesson plans in place, he is never sailing alone.\n",
      "“I know when things get really bad, particularly in the Southern Ocean, that the kids help bring me home,” Wilson said.\n",

      "A longtime doctor for the American gymnastics team was charged with sexual assault on Wednesday in Michigan.\n",
      "The doctor, Lawrence G. Nassar, faces 22 charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct involving at least seven victims. Prosecutors said that they expected more charges and that they were hearing from more victims.\n",
      "“This guy is a monster,” Bill Schuette, the attorney general of Michigan, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “You read those affidavits and it shocks you to the very core.”\n",
      "The affidavits describe the accounts of victims as young as 10 who say Dr. Nassar digitally penetrated them and molested them under the guise of performing medical treatment. Many were repeatedly assaulted over the course of years.\n",
      "The attorney general’s office said the assaults occurred at Dr. Nassar’s home treatment room; at Michigan State, where he had a clinic; and at a gymnastics club. According to the charges, the victims were 13 to 16 years old.\n",
      "Ms. Dantzscher and other women have filed civil lawsuits against Dr. Nassar. The American federation is also named as a defendant in a suit, accused of burying complaints about, and not adequately supervising, him.\n",
      "Dr. Nassar, 53, also separately faces charges of sexual abuse of a family friend and possessing child pornography. F.B.I. agents said he had tens of thousands of pornographic images as well as videos of himself molesting girls. Dr. Nassar is being held without bail on those charges. He will be arraigned for the new charges on Thursday.\n",
      "John Manly, a lawyer representing the three former gymnasts, told “60 Minutes” that “at least 60” women had come forward with accusations of sexual abuse by Dr. Nassar.\n",
      "“At the end of the day, there are members of every single Olympic team since 1996 he did this to,” Mr. Manly said. “That’s what we’re going to end up with.”\n",
      "Matt Newburg, a Michigan lawyer who has represented Dr. Nassar, declined to comment on the latest charges. Dr. Nassar has denied accusations against him in the past.\n",
      "One of the victims quoted in the affidavits cited the pressure of competing at a high level as a reason she returned to Dr. Nassar despite the assaults:\n",
      "“Victim B stated that as a competitive gymnast, you would do anything to get yourself better and that the coaches were always pressuring them to get better. She said it was like you were always in trouble if you were hurt. At the time, she thought she had to submit to this treatment to get better and never told her parents because she had to get better. Victim B stated that she and all the gymnasts trusted Nassar and that he was like a god to the gymnasts.”\n",

      "But come March, we’re suddenly Governors fans. We want the underdog teams to beat the heavyweights like Kansas, Duke and Michigan State. We want the little guys to triumph. At least we think we do.\n",
      "Another study revealed that underdog status doesn’t merely inspire rooting, it also changes our perception of what we see on the court. When told that a team was the underdog, research participants saw a play like a defender getting close to an opponent and knocking the ball away as reflecting hustle and grit. When watching the very same play, but under the impression that it came from the favored team instead, people saw the tough defense as more of a reflection of natural ability, not effort.\n",
      "To those of us who watch sports, the appeal of the underdog may seem utterly normal and even instinctual. But there’s something counterintuitive about it all. So often in life we try to associate ourselves with winning and success. We are quick to name-drop, hop on bandwagons and buy luxury brands that convey status. Why, then, do we hitch our own wagons to teams that, by definition, are more likely than not to fail?\n",
      "A variety of reasons, actually. There’s the idea of emotional payoff. There’s more potential for return on the investment when you root for the underdog than when the expected happens and the favorite wins. We get such a surge from seeing upsets, and cheering for the least likely outcome, that we’re willing to risk the lesser odds.\n",
      "But perhaps most of all, we’re drawn to the message that giants can be toppled, that with a little luck we, too, can overcome.\n",
      "Politicians know this, too. Bill Clinton might be a Rhodes scholar who went to Yale Law School, but on the campaign trail he was always just a modest guy from a small town in Arkansas. This year is no different. Voters can opt for the son of a hard-working immigrant bartender (Marco Rubio) or the son of a humble pastor (Ted Cruz).\n",
      "On the Democratic side, voters can support the potential first female president. Or the first Jewish president. All politicians seem to want us to think they have underdog status and were born in a log cabin, as President Clinton himself once noted. A candidate who presumably would have decorated that log cabin with, say, his own last name and logo in gaudy gold lettering frames his campaign through the lens of outsider cachet.\n",
      "Yet with our fondness for the underdog, we usually say one thing and do the other. We love underdog independent bookstores but still spend more money at Amazon. We love the neighborhood Italian joint but still take the kids to Olive Garden. We say all the right things about supporting local businesses, but convenience and discount prices often win out.\n",
      "Same with sports: When it’s time to fill out those March Madness brackets, we are likely to rely too much on the favorites. Research on N.F.L. betting over two decades indicates that underdogs at home football games cover the point spread more than half of the time and yet they draw only 40 percent of betting money.\n",
      "It’s an intoxicating, yet often fleeting and shallow fling, our romance with the underdog. We’re enthralled by David, but wager more on Goliath. We’ll spend this Thursday and Friday rooting for basketball Cinderella stories, but still festoon our walls with the logos of favorites.\n",

      "Here are Miles 1 through 24, left mostly intact, complete with dated references to the Nets’ new home (they’ve played at Barclays Center for over four years now) and TV shows like “Mad Men,” “30 Rock” and “Gossip Girl.”\n",
      "When more than 50,000 runners line up to start the New York City Marathon on Sunday, the foot of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge in Staten Island will be like a shaken soda bottle.\n",
      "Runners in the green start will be on the lower level of the bridge, and those in the blue and orange starts on the upper level. Everyone will spend the first mile going uphill. Not many runners are likely to feel the effects, at least not yet. There is too much exhilaration in the air, and too many people around to run very fast, anyway.\n",
      "As runners reach the end of their climb at the middle of the bridge and the Mile 1 marker, they may feel on top of the world. In actuality, they will be at the highest elevation point of the race. Only four boroughs and 25 miles to go. Oh yes, and those 385 yards.\n",
      "After a glorious run uphill in the opening mile of the New York City Marathon, Mile 2 is a downhill joy ride from the crest of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge into Brooklyn.\n",
      "A certain giddiness can take hold here. The air of celebration and the steady decline give runners a natural boost.\n",
      "John Honerkamp, a running coach with New York Road Runners, said it was easy to go too fast here, and suggested not worrying about split times yet.\n",
      "“The first two miles are a wash,” Honerkamp said. Enjoy the view, he advised, and forget the GPS until Mile 3. “If you hammer a downhill, you can mess up your quads. Err on going too slow.”\n",
      "There is plenty to divert the pace-obsessed. There are more than 1,700 portable bathrooms at Fort Wadsworth, and a steady dose of them along the course beginning at Mile 3. But for some runners, the staggered starts and long waits in corrals are too much. The side of the bridge becomes a de facto urinal. Race organizers, for the record, prohibit this. But those of us who have run this race invariably recall it.\n",
      "As runners complete their descent, they begin to diverge into their color-coded routes, spilling like rivulets into the streets.\n",
      "My Times colleague Samantha Farlow said she was struck here by the first glimpse of spectators: a small number of them, high above on an overpass, offering a warm welcome to Brooklyn. The crowds will soon thicken and the volume rise, but it’s all about small memories like this one, isn’t it?\n",
      "In 1970, 127 distance runners paid a dollar each to run in the first New York City Marathon. The course consisted of loops around the rolling hills of Central Park. Fewer than half finished.\n",
      "That first citywide race, in 1976, had 2,090 runners. Adding tens of thousands of people to the field over the decades has turned race management into a science. One of the most difficult tasks is keeping runners moving through the relatively narrow streets of the first few miles. That is why the start is staggered into four waves on three color-coded routes (each with their own “start village” at Fort Wadsworth). And it is why runners are further divided into crowd-control corrals at the start.\n",
      "It is here in Bay Ridge, between Miles 2 and 3, where the three routes are most separate. Athletes in the blue stream (the elite men and women follow this route) are the first to exit the highway off the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge onto Dahlgren Place. They hang a left at 92nd Street and a right onto Fourth Avenue, where they will settle in for the next five and a half miles.\n",
      "The orange stream exits at 92nd Street, abruptly loops back toward the bridge and takes a right turn and then another right onto Fourth Avenue, merging with their blue brethren.\n",
      "And then there are the greenies, who ran on the lower level of the bridge. While the upper-level blue and orange people quickly exit to streets, the greenies stay on the Gowanus Expressway a bit longer, in the southbound lanes, which everyone hopes will be a little less congested than during rush hour.\n",
      "The greenies do not rejoin everyone else on Fourth Avenue until well after Mile 3, at Bay Ridge Parkway. Now, separated only by the median, and with thickening crowds of supporters, everyone is in this together.\n",
      "With marathoners now settled on Fourth Avenue for a lengthy stretch, many take stock of their pace, grab their first cup of water or high-five a child for the first of, oh, a hundred times.\n",
      "Perhaps they’ll wave back to coffee sippers at Mocha Mocha or hookah smokers at the Gulf Cafe. They’ll marvel at how many houses of worship line Fourth Avenue.\n",
      "Athletes will scan the sidewalks for family and friends who’ve taken the R train to Bay Ridge before they hop back on the subway in hopes of outpacing their loved one to another point on the course. (Spectators looking for a specific runner should be on the runners’ left for orange athletes and to the right for blue and green.)\n",
      "A few decades ago, Bay Ridge was known as home to generations of families with Italian, Irish and Scandinavian roots. Today, Russians, Asians and Arabs have arrived in large numbers. (There is still a Norwegian parade every May.) This is as much a cultural mix as any neighborhood along the way.\n",
      "Goodbye, Bay Ridge.\n",
      "Hello, Sunset Park.\n",
      "There’s St. Michael’s. Moving right along.\n",
      "In the sixth mile, competitors will fly by at least half a dozen live bands and one spectacular cemetery.\n",
      "There’s a string of fast-food restaurants on this stretch, but large quantities of everything can be had at Costco one avenue to the runners’ left, at Third and 38th.\n",
      "This neighborhood is named after the cemetery: Greenwood Heights.\n",
      "With all the cheering and the music, with runners dressed in tuxedos, tutus and Superman outfits, marathoners may be excused if they are not focusing on the American Revolution and the American pastime.\n",
      "That Old Stone House (built in 1699 and reconstructed in the 1930s) was the site of important fighting in the Battle of Brooklyn on Aug. 27, 1776. The British Army was thumping George Washington’s troops, but an outmanned Maryland regiment fought off the British long enough for the rest of the American troops to escape and fight another day.\n",
      "The Dodgers and their rooters would be famously colorful and boisterous in the decades to come, but when the team advertised for ballplayers back in 1883, it seemed that management wanted a gentlemanly bunch, according to Richard Goldstein, author of the 1991 book “Superstars and Screwballs: 100 Years of Brooklyn Baseball” and a former editor at The Times.\n",
      "“A runner in the vicinity of Washington Park back then might have expected a sedate setting,” he said. “As a writer for the sports journal New York Clipper put it: ‘They want men of intelligence and not corner-lot toughs who may happen to possess some ability as players.’ ”\n",
      "This stretch of Fourth, between Miles 6 and 7, was once a bit dingy and off the commercial path, but is now ripe for a diversionary game of Count the Condos.\n",
      "The subway station at Ninth Street is the best bet for spectators wanting to watch around here. It has a crossover, so you won’t be stuck on one side (you can’t cross Fourth as the runners go by), as you might at other nearby stations. Also, you could arrive on the R, F or G train and then hop back on the G to head farther up the course to perhaps encounter those same tuxedos, tutus and Supermen.\n",
      "Once athletes cross the Mile 7 mark, there’s less than a mile to go on Fourth Avenue before the complexion of the course changes dramatically.\n",
      "As the tower approaches, details like the four-sided clock below the dome come into sharper relief.\n",
      "The numbered streets crossing Fourth Avenue, which helped marathoners track their progress all the way from the 90s in Bay Ridge, are gone. Now it’s streets like Garfield, Carroll and President.\n",
      "Union, Sackett, Degraw and Douglass fly by. Butler, Baltic, Warren, St. Mark’s. Some cool bars line the left side here, like Pacific Standard and 4th Avenue Pub.\n",
      "Flatbush Avenue runs the entire length of Brooklyn, but marathoners will enjoy it for about 225 yards before hanging a sharp right onto Lafayette Avenue.\n",
      "Next it’s on to the ninth mile, through some of New York City’s most vibrant neighborhoods.\n",
      "This mile, which crosses through the Fort Greene and Clinton Hill sections of Brooklyn, is one to savor. If Fourth Avenue was like a long overture to a classical symphony, allowing marathoners to settle in and spread out, then Lafayette Avenue is like a brisk jazz solo.\n",
      "The path is much thinner now, on a one-way street, adding a sense of intimacy and the illusion of moving faster.\n",
      "The majestic Peter Jay Sharp Building of the Brooklyn Academy of Music soon appears on the right. Across the street is Berlyn, a visually tasty (and that’s all that matters right now) German-Austrian restaurant.\n",
      "Fulton Street cuts through diagonally, creating a fork in the road and a space called Fowler Square, which is more like a triangle. It features a statue of a beloved Civil War general and an expanded pedestrian area. Restaurants and bars like Smoke Joint, Mullanes Bar and Grill and Frank’s Cocktail Bar line the angles of the intersection.\n",
      "The race itself takes in only a brief slice of the neighborhood, in the northwest corner. After the Mile 9 marker, at Classon Avenue, the course runs a few hundred more yards on Lafayette Avenue before turning left on Bedford Avenue.\n",
      "This rest of the mile is a downhill, low-key breather, with the Citigroup Center’s unmistakable angled roof visible in the distance in Manhattan. It’s a good time to check pace, breathe easy and, to the extent that it’s possible during a 26.2-mile run, relax.\n",
      "Remember the roar of the crowd at the end of Fourth Avenue? Those spectators on Lafayette who may have sweetly fibbed when they said you looked awesome?\n",
      "The marathon, Robbins writes, runs “counter to the Hasidic community’s strict interpretation of the commandment of tznuit, modesty.” So when the runners reach this stretch, “they are met with silence, interrupted only by the rustling of the fall leaves on the street or the muted sounds of small hands clapping. The runners see stares — quizzical, blank or bored — or they see people look away in modesty.”\n",
      "The sight of thousands of runners in shorts or skin-tights traipsing through such a traditional neighborhood, as men go about their regular Sunday business (Sabbath was Saturday) and women walk with their children and strollers, is unforgettable and so totally Brooklyn.\n",
      "It is also fleeting. After crossing the aptly named Division Avenue, Bedford slants to the right, putting the ramp to the Williamsburg Bridge into view. The look of the bystanders changes.\n",
      "At Broadway, and a block to the right, is the beautiful dome atop the original Williamsburgh Savings Bank building, finished in 1875 (Peter Luger Steakhouse is across the street).\n",
      "Just past the bridge on the right is a colorful mural outside the Williamsburg Music Center, which showcases the local jazz scene. The South Side is a longtime home to Puerto Rican and Dominican residents, but like so many neighborhoods around here it is gentrifying rapidly.\n",
      "Runners enter the park while still in Williamsburg, enjoy a peaceful, tree-lined stretch, and exit in the home of Mile 13, Greenpoint.\n",
      "Greenpoint comes right after Williamsburg, both on the marathon route and in the changes sweeping through the waterfront neighborhoods of Brooklyn.\n",
      "On Manhattan Avenue, though, our running path for the 13th mile, an old-neighborhood feel remains, and an unconventional runner craving protein will find plenty of places to grab kielbasa.\n",
      "As marathoners emerge from the relaxing tree cover of McCarren Park, they pass the Mile 12 marker and angle left onto Manhattan Avenue, where Bedford Avenue ends.\n",
      "A block later, the masses swing a sharp right onto Greenpoint Avenue for perhaps a one-minute downhill glide, and then a left onto McGuinness Boulevard.\n",
      "It is a testament to the lure of this area that even on this stretch of McGuinness, where loud trucks rumble past wheel alignment shops and electrical supply companies, condos line the left side of the street.\n",
      "The Pulaski Bridge is just ahead. Is it halftime already?\n",
      "The 13.1-mile mark is a chance to assess the landscape and ask some questions. Am I on pace? Am I drinking enough? Why am I doing this?\n",
      "Atop the bridge, marathoners will have their first sweeping views since the start of the race. There is the Midtown Manhattan skyline to the left, and signs everywhere else of the city’s infrastructure and industrial past: the traffic-clogged Kosciuszko Bridge, the tolls to the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and the Queens Citigroup Building, the city’s tallest outside Manhattan.\n",
      "But this is a time to focus on what lies ahead, not below. We’re halfway to the finish, an exhilarating moment. Nice and easy on that decline into Queens, though. There’s a doozy of an uphill on the way.\n",
      "“Everybody was Irish or Italian,” said Ledden, one of the Irish guys, over a beer at Corner Bistro on Vernon Boulevard. “They intermarried. Talk to another old-timer around here and I’m probably related to them.”\n",
      "“The Budweiser keeps the memory going,” he said.\n",
      "Once gritty, Long Island City now has more of a Greenwich Village feel, complete with Greenwich Village restaurants.\n",
      "Corner Bistro, a packed burger-and-beer joint on West Fourth Street, has a Long Island City offshoot where Tommy Ledden’s bar stool resides and window seats offer a view of the marathon course. He’s an old-neighborhood guy in a new-neighborhood bar.\n",
      "The invasion of the Manhattanites has not bothered Ledden one bit.\n",
      "“They’re all nice people,” he said. “Everyone I’ve met.”\n",
      "Next, it is the marathoners’ turn to invade Manhattan.\n",
      "We’ve made a series of turns during our two miles in Queens. Left on 48th Avenue off the Pulaski Bridge. Right on Vernon Boulevard, past those restaurants. Right on 44th Drive, a quiet stretch. Left on Crescent Street, where we can see the back of the giant Silvercup sign. This is the bakery-turned-studio where TV shows like “30 Rock” and “Gossip Girl” are filmed.\n",
      "The taxing turns during miles past are catching up with us. The incline on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge was actually longer than this one, but we barely noticed it back then. The road up the Queensboro, though, seems endless. Legs start aching. Arms grow weary from pushing the wheelchair.\n",
      "We are on the lower level of the bridge, and while the views of the East River, Manhattan and Roosevelt Island below are nice, there is a slight sensation of being in a darkened tunnel. After miles of rousing spectator support, there is nobody around now, only the pitter-patter of our fellow marathoners’ footsteps. It can get a little lonely.\n",
      "Then there is this daunting thought: still more than 10 miles to go.\n",
      "But just as quickly as it formed, the cloud begins to lift. The climb up the bridge is complete and we are descending into Manhattan. There’s a faint sound up ahead that is gradually getting louder.\n",
      "Our legs start to recover a bit, and that sound is now a rising roar. We’re gliding downhill now, almost there.\n",
      "And then we reach the source of that sound: swarms of well-wishers welcoming us to Manhattan as if we were a gold medal marathoner entering the Olympic Stadium.\n",
      "We suddenly find ourselves the toast of an Upper East Side parade. Our spirits lift and our legs feel lighter.\n",
      "F. Scott Fitzgerald’s passage from “The Great Gatsby” finally rings true. “The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time, in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the world.”\n",
      "Only 10 miles to go. All is groovy.\n",
      "The New York City Marathon is steeped in the city’s popular culture, and no part of the course is more celebrated and packed with spectators than the Upper East Side.\n",
      "As they exit the Queensboro Bridge, athletes swing a hairpin turn onto 59th Street and into a wall of sound from the crowd. They pass the restaurant Uncorked on the right. “Mile 16 is in our blood,” said the manager, Paul Murdock, whose patrons also have mimosas in their blood.\n",
      "Marathoners quickly hang a left on First Avenue, where they settle in for a straight-arrow 3.4-mile joy ride.\n",
      "The residential towers here dwarf the churches and their chance to serve as beacons, but a sharp-eyed runner may catch some of the nice details etched into the entrance of the Church of St. John Nepomucene at 66th Street.\n",
      "Police barricades line this portion of the course because the rowdy crowds on both sides can run four to five people deep. Brunchers with a view cheer from restaurants, and support rains down from fire escapes and balconies.\n",
      "Plenty of runners are whooping it up, too, as the party atmosphere reaches a fever pitch.\n",
      "Fred Lebow would love it.\n",
      "The marathon parade continues up First Avenue as marathoners pass the Mile 17 marker around 77th Street.\n",
      "There is a gentle uptick in elevation until 85th Street, where a special vista is revealed: a sea of human heads bouncing up and down, straight ahead and as far as the eye can see.\n",
      "A runner can get lost in the hypnotic visual and perhaps take comfort in the knowledge that the heads rest atop other weary and aching bodies. It’s a collective pain. And it is a relief — fleeting, of course — to see no inclines or turns in the viewable future, just downhill and flat terrain.\n",
      "A cookie, maybe later on. For now, we’ll have to settle for that gel station at Mile 18.\n",
      "By the time the masses begin the 19th mile around East 97th Street, elite runners will have been resting comfortably for some time beyond the finish, perhaps enjoying lunch or a nice massage.\n",
      "There is a fair chance that during this fast, flat portion of the course, the winner is engaged in a brutal race strategy known as the surge. As if 4-minute-50-second miles were not fast enough over the entire race, a man might throw in a sub-4:30 around here in hopes of breaking up the pack or demoralizing an opponent who had thus far seemed in command. Many fine high school athletes dream of running 4:30 for a single mile, let alone tossing one in at Mile 19.\n",
      "But that stuff happens in the morning. It’s the afternoon now, and as runners enter East Harlem, the corridor effect of residential towers lining First Avenue begins to dissipate. There are more low-rise apartments and public housing complexes, along with a sprinkling of snazzy condos.\n",
      "But wise is the spectator who watches from the other side of First Avenue, on the runners’ left. There, up by 117th, you can grab some pizza from Patsy’s (“There ain’t nothin’ like that,” Frank Sinatra once said). Patsy’s, which opened in 1933, is a tasty reminder of the neighborhood’s Italian past.\n",
      "After screaming kind words to the marathoners between bites, cheerleaders can stroll over to Fifth Avenue to see them again after they return from the Bronx.\n",
      "That double dose of support can lift the spirits of marathoners whose bodies are beginning to cry, “Enough!”\n",
      "We are here today to defend the honor of the Willis Avenue Bridge.\n",
      "This span, which connects Manhattan to the Bronx about halfway between Miles 19 and 20, has something of a reputation among marathoners. It is, many memories recall, a carpeted pathway into a brick wall.\n",
      "Second, there’s no law saying you’re going to hit the wall. Many marathoners who do long practice runs, keep a measured pace in the early miles and take in some calories during the race experience no such thing, at least at Mile 20. And many of those who do will come back to finish with gusto.\n",
      "Geoffrey Mutai, the 2011 winner, used the bridge as a springboard, going on to scorch the final 10 kilometers and win in a course-record time of 2 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds (about 4:46 per mile).\n",
      "Marathoners glide straight onto the bridge at East 126th Street, ending the First Avenue phase of the race. To the left is a series of little bridges spanning the Harlem River, including the Madison Avenue Bridge, which carries marathoners back into Manhattan. To the right is the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough), a three-bridge complex that goes to Randalls Island and then either to the Bronx or Queens.\n",
      "And straight ahead is the Bronx. The first five-borough race, in 1976, barely touched a toe in the Bronx, which at the time was becoming a symbol of urban blight.\n",
      "Today, the Bronx portion is full of zigs and zags, funky signs and heartfelt spectator support.\n",
      "Thanks for the lift, dear Willis Avenue Bridge.\n",
      "Left. Right. Left-right-left. And-a-left-and-a-right.\n",
      "Professional runners and Boston Marathon aspirants may not appreciate lots of turns, but marathoners who had their fill of straight-ahead running on First Avenue may just love the Bronx. Where else in the race do you run the corners around a Western Beef supermarket?\n",
      "Here, runners will encounter the perfect autumn atmosphere, with changing trees, music and supportive crowds.\n",
      "Just past the Greater Central Baptist Church, on 132nd Street, there is a new brunch spot called Shell’s Bistro, which doubles as a real estate brokerage. Here, the food servers are also brokers, said the owner, Andrew Shell. So patrons can order two eggs and two bedrooms while cheering on the runners.\n",
      "The course swings around one of the best parks in Harlem, Marcus Garvey Park, a shady bit of nature with rocky outcroppings. The race jogs around the park and back onto Fifth Avenue for the continuing southward march.\n",
      "Museum Mile awaits.\n",
      "After a little jog around the lovely Marcus Garvey Park, the marathon route returns to Fifth Avenue.\n",
      "Now it’s a straight shot down Fifth.\n",
      "At 110th Street, a roundabout called Duke Ellington Circle serves as an introduction to Central Park. There’s a statue of the jazz great Ellington to the right.\n",
      "The first site along Central Park is the Harlem Meer, which dominates the vista to the right. Water, willow tree, ducks, geese. Forget about the pain, and check out the meer.\n",
      "And there’s the Mile 23 mark.\n",
      "Barely five kilometers to go. For a well-trained marathoner, a 5K is a nap in the park, a speed workout.\n",
      "But this is no ordinary 5K. It is the final three-plus miles of the New York City Marathon, and by now, after 23 miles on the road, muscles are screaming.\n",
      "The next mile is almost entirely uphill. It’s not a severe incline, and it isn’t something that would faze a fresh runner. But this final stretch of Fifth Avenue and the rolling hills in Central Park offer an extra challenge on this memorable ride.\n",
      "A couple of blocks later, also on the right, is Girls’ Gate, one of the 20 named entrances to the park. They were part of the original park plan, but the names were not chiseled until the second half of the 1900s. Did I mention that we’re going uphill?\n",
      "On the left side of Fifth, the cultural hits keep coming. The Jewish Museum is housed in the former Warburg Mansion at 92nd Street. A block later is the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, in Andrew Carnegie’s 64-room mansion.\n",
      "At 90th Street, with the familiar roundness of the Guggenheim Museum sticking out a couple of blocks ahead, the race angles into Central Park.\n",
      "The road curves to the right at the bottom of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, and the back of the mammoth Metropolitan Museum of Art comes into view. So does the Mile 24 marker.\n",
      "Two to go, and then some.\n",
      "Perhaps you have visited Central Park, or maybe you’re a New Yorker who runs there regularly. Regardless, the park feels different right now. There is temporary lining on either side of the road, creating a slight tunnel effect, and the crowds and sounds and disorientation from having run so far can make familiar places seem foreign.\n",
      "The course turns right into Central Park, and soon the Mile 26 marker will signal that there is just 385 yards to go. Months of sacrifice come down to this. It’s a bit of an uphill now, and the finish line finally comes into sight. Just a little ... more ... to go ... and …\n",

      "HOUSTON — There was the game on the field, and there was the one watched through the political prism of these times.\n",
      "On social media, the Atlanta Falcons were not just the N.F.C. champions, they were stand-ins for anti-Trump ferment, coming from a staunchly Democratic city and facing a Patriots team whose owner, head coach and starting quarterback are all friends with the president, to varying degrees.\n",
      "“Falcons are fun and their biggest stars aren’t pro Trump,” JayZito wrote on Twitter. “I’m a Falcons fan today.”\n",
      "25 Photos\n",
      "Chang W. Lee/The New York Times\n",
      "Vice President Mike Pence attended the game and drew some boos when he was shown on a stadium screen talking with James Baker, who served as secretary of state under former President George Bush. Mr. Bush did the opening coin toss from a wheelchair on the field, accompanied by the former first lady Barbara Bush.\n",
      "A succession of commercials with themes of inclusion, immigration and multiculturalism were seen by many viewers as commentary on Trump’s executive orders restricting immigration and his calls for a wall along the Mexican border.\n",
      "The actor Morgan Freeman appeared in a commercial for Turkish Airlines, speaking about “bridging worlds and finding delight in our differences.”\n",
      "Before, during and after the game, people talked about an ad for the construction-supply company 84 Lumber that featured imagery of a Mexican mother and daughter on a journey north for a better life in the United States. The company deleted some scenes depicting a border wall but included the full ad on its website.\n",
      "The right-wing website Breitbart News, in its live coverage of the game, grew exasperated.\n",
      "“These commercials have been a bonanza of leftist activism: two immigration commercials, a feminist commercial, now an eco wacko commercial? Am I missing anything?” one of the editors wrote.\n",
      "About the only aspect of the game that generated a surprisingly more muted political discussion than expected was the one everybody seemed to think would cause a stir: the halftime show by Lady Gaga, a persistent critic of Mr. Trump.\n",
      "With a dash of patriotic imagery — red and blue drones forming the shape of the United States — she mostly stuck to her hits, with only a few gestures that some interpreted as subtle digs at the president.\n",
      "During her song “Million Reasons” she hugged a woman of uncertain ethnicity and sang, “Why don’t you stay,” a move that people on Twitter thought was a statement about race and immigration.\n",
      "The N.F.L. tried in its own way to unify the country for a few hours.\n",
      "Fans at the stadium were given small flags to wave during the singing of the national anthem, and when the teams ran onto the field, they were led by soldiers and sailors holding large American flags. The league even ran a 60-second commercial called “Inside These Lines” to show that “the power of football” can “bring people together.”\n",
      "Still, outside the stadium it was another story.\n",
      "Atlanta, the capital of a solidly red state, was suddenly adopted as a darling of left-leaning football fans. One commenter on Twitter joked, “The Falcons respect an independent judiciary,” a dig at the president’s criticism of the federal judge in Seattle who temporarily halted the refugee ban.\n",
      "After the game, Martellus Bennett, a tight end for the Patriots, reiterated his vow not to attend the customary congratulatory ceremony at the White House, because he opposes Mr. Trump.\n",
      "“What an amazing comeback and win by the Patriots,’’ he wrote on Twitter. “Tom Brady, Bob Kraft and Coach B are total winners. Wow!”\n",
