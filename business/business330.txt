AdvertisementJOHANNESBURG —  Businessman Christo Wiese stunned crisis-hit Steinhoff with a $5 billion lawsuit on Thursday, sending shares of the South African multinational retailer fighting for survival after it uncovered accounting irregularities down 17 percent.The 59 billion rand (£3.59 billion) claim is the latest setback for the retailer in which Wiese was chairman and biggest shareholder until December last year. Steinhoff's share price has tumbled more than 90 percent following the scandal, which also triggered a cash crunch.Titan Group, which houses some of Wiese's family assets, said the claim related to the 2016 capital injection by Wiese to help Steinhoff to pay its debt and fund the acquisition of the U.S. company Mattress Firm.The claim also relates to the acquisition by Steinhoff of Wiese's clothing retailer Pepkor in 2015, in which Wiese and other Pepkor shareholders subscribed for Steinhoff shares as part of his payment.AdvertisementSteinhoff said in a statement it would assess Wiese's claim and determine the appropriate course of action.AdvertisementWiese's 22 percent shareholding in Steinhoff fell to around 6 percent after banks he had borrowed money from exercised the security rights over the stock because had used the stock as collateral.Shares in Steinhoff fell as much as 17 percent on Thursday to 1.83 rand, valuing the company around 8 billion rand, a dramatic fall from grace for the stock that was valued at around 200 billion rand just four months ago.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
