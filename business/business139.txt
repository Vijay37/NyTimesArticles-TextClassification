And even if the parallel is not exact, it’s hardly encouraging: Silvio Berlusconi, who served nine years as Italy’s prime minister.The two men share many qualities apart from their mutual admiration for President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and attractive women. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi is a billionaire. He initially made his fortune as a real estate developer, then diversified into banking, advertising, publishing, news and entertainment media and ownership of the European soccer club A.C. Milan.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi was elected prime minister as a change agent, called the novus homo of a populist uprising. As in the United States, (and unlike most European countries) no conflict-of-interest laws in Italy prevent the prime minister from owning a business. Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Berlusconi faced calls to divest his sprawling business empire.Mr. Berlusconi resigned all his executive positions and directorships and pledged to have no day-to-day involvement in running the businesses. But he did not divest — he retained majority ownership and installed his adult offspring in oversight positions, much as Mr. Trump has suggested he will do.A result was an unending series of scandals, even as Mr. Berlusconi’s businesses profited and the size of his personal fortune soared, reaching $12 billion by 2005, according to an estimate by Forbes magazine, considered the most reliable guide to the world’s wealthiest people. (Berlusconi’s wealth has declined significantly since he left office. Forbes estimates his current net worth at $5.6 billion.)“There were so many scandals with Berlusconi that it’s hard to know where to begin,” said Alexander Stille, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School and author of “The Sack of Rome,” a critical look at Mr. Berlusconi’s entangled business and political fortunes. Mr. Stille pointed to a communications law that allowed the prime minister to maintain a virtual monopoly over private television in Italy.“That kind of thing happened all the time,” he said. “All sorts of provisions appeared to be tailor-made to fit the contours of his business empire.”“It’s unbelievable to us in Italy,” Mr. Pollicino said, “that we’d be comparing Berlusconi to an American president.”Norman Eisen, a lawyer and conflicts-of-interest specialist who advised the Obama administration and is now at the Brookings Institution, agreed. “It’s shocking that we’re even having a conversation comparing Trump to Berlusconi and his antecedent strongmen of Italy, a long line that runs all the way back to Caesar,” Mr. Eisen said. “I guess we’ll all be relieved if he turns out to be Berlusconi and not Mussolini.”Mr. Eisen said that anything is possible, though. “We’ll know when we see his actual plan to address the business conflicts,” he added. “That will tell us whether he’ll abuse and make a mockery of the office or do what every other modern president has done and put his assets in a blind trust or the equivalent.”A spokeswoman said Mr. Trump declined to comment for this column.Such an arrangement seemed to impose few restraints on Mr. Berlusconi. “Berlusconi said he had nothing to do with operating his business empire,” Mr. Stille said. “But then he’d meet with business figures like Rupert Murdoch and discuss business. There was very little separation.”And in his career Mr. Trump has shown more respect for the law than Mr. Berlusconi did. “Trump has pushed the legal envelope,” Mr. Eisen said. “Berlusconi broke right through it.”But many more of Mr. Berlusconi’s businesses are domestic than Mr. Trump’s, with relatively few interests that might be influenced by foreign governments. “Trump’s business interests are primarily international,” Mr. Eisen said. “In that sense Trump is more dangerous than Berlusconi.”To the dismay of many, the Italian electorate showed scant interest in any of Mr. Berlusconi’s blatant conflicts. He was elected three times despite the constant drumbeat of scandal. “None of these issues seemed to register with the Italian public,” Mr. Stille said. “It was incredibly depressing to those of us writing about it. Most Italians with limited experience outside Italy assumed this was somehow not exceptional. It was just the way the world worked.”Indeed, Mr. Pollicino said, Mr. Berlusconi’s resignation, in 2011, had “nothing to do with any of the scandals — it was because of Italy’s severe economic distress and investors’ loss of confidence in the Italian markets.”Like Mr. Berlusconi, Mr. Trump has said that voters were fully aware of his business activities and potential conflicts when they cast ballots for him, and that “only the crooked media makes this a big deal.”But the fact that Mr. Berlusconi largely got away with it does not mean Mr. Trump should look to him as a role model. “Berlusconi,” Mr. Eisen said, “was widely viewed internationally as the second-greatest Italian clown since Roberto Benigni,” the comic actor. “But Italy plays a vastly smaller role in the world order than the United States does. We can’t afford to have that here, and I don’t think the American public would stand for it.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
