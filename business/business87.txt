The New York Times is one of many venues that has made repeated mention of this.Do a Google search, and the uncharted territory looks well-charted. A search for “President Trump” and “uncharted territory” produced 27,500 results (in 0.44 seconds).“Highly unusual.” These words too have turned up with increased frequency in Times articles and opinion pieces about the new president’s decisions, announcements and actions during his first months in office.Phil Corbett, The Times’s editor of standards and practices, addressed the question of when exactly “highly unusual” events become usual, and when an unprecedented course of events become, well, precedented: “Obviously and by definition, something can only be ‘unprecedented’ once,” writes Mr. Corbett. “And, to avoid hype, the Times stylebook urges that we specify what aspect of something really qualifies as ‘unprecedented.’ Overall, the idea is: Use with care.“As for ‘unusual,’ it’s probably also a good idea to provide context for that description — especially, as you say, if the ‘unusual’ starts to become the norm. In some cases, perhaps one could say something like ‘which was unusual in past administrations’ or ‘which was rare under previous presidencies.’ ”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
