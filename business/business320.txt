AdvertisementSupported by50 years after the uprisingNEWARK — The fuse that ignited this city — violent clashes with the police, gunfire, flames from burning buildings — was a rumor. Word spread that a black cabdriver had been killed inside a police precinct house. It was not true — the driver had been arrested and injured.Still, it was enough to inflame a population filled with years of pent-up grievances: not only abuse at the hands of the police, but entrenched, unaddressed poverty, urban renewal policies that bypassed black residents and a white political power structure that had long ignored their needs.The unrest, which started on the night of July 12, 1967, and ended on July 17, came during a period when racial tensions were exploding into violent conflagrations across the country: the Watts neighborhood in Los Angeles, Harlem, Detroit and nearby New Jersey communities, including Plainfield.Amid all that, what made Newark’s unrest striking was the physical toll, placing it among the deadliest of the riots. Over several days, 26 people were killed — many of them black residents, as well as a white firefighter and a white police detective — and more than 700 were injured. The riots caused about $10 million in damages and reduced entire blocks to charred ruins, some of which remain vacant grass-covered lots.The turbulence also left an enduring legacy in molding perceptions of the city, even though those impressions vary widely. To some, the flames and violence were riots, wrecking neighborhoods and driving away white and middle-class residents, feeding a notion that Newark was a dangerous and broken place. Or it was a rebellion, the uprising of a long-oppressed community that had finally had enough, and from that, a new sense of empowerment was born.On July 12, 1967, residents of a large public housing development saw the black cabdriver badly beaten by police officers and followed them to the Fourth Police Precinct house, in Newark’s Central Ward. The crowd ignored calls for a peaceful protest, and the police responded in force.He was a law student at the time and has long been a civil rights activist in Newark. He is now director of the Abbott Leadership Institute at Rutgers University, Newark.It was very tense in Newark before this happened, and it was all based on race and class, but race predominated because all of this was happening at the expense of and to black people, no matter if you were poor, middle-class or working. The police were agents of oppression and the political system was hellbent on keeping us in our place.He served as a member of the New Jersey National Guard and deployed to the Central Ward of Newark on July 14, 1967, his 25th birthday. He recently retired as a professor of American history at Brookdale Community College and is the director of the World War II Era Studies Institute.There was nothing but a huge red glow over the entire city. The city was in flames. You immediately took note of what you may be entering into — and that was a war zone. Buildings were smashed, windows were broken all over the place. You saw a very angry crowd, and when they saw you, they started coming in and around your Jeep.I saw two black men fighting like hell among themselves, and what I did was pull my pistol and fire two shots into the air. [He told the men to leave.] They stopped fighting and they scampered down the street. But to my surprise, when I did that, someone within a blacked-out church — St. Rose of Lima Church off Orange Street — took aim at me and fired at me. The bullets came toward me and went over my head by about a foot. I didn’t know I was being fired at. Someone called out, “Don’t you know you’re being fired at?” If it weren’t for that individual, who I considered an angel, I wouldn’t have taken cover.Albert BlackHe grew up in Newark, leaving in 1971 for college at Columbia University. He and his wife raised their four sons in Ridgewood, N.J., and they now live there and in New York City, where he works as a lawyer and adjunct professor at New York University Law School.He is a lifelong resident of the city, who was about 4 years old during the unrest.I only can remember hearing my mother saying, “Boy, move from the window and get under the bed!”What is your most vivid memory from the riots?Following the National Guard convoys out of the city at night after my shift as a copy editor ended at The Newark News. I was concerned at the time that my Army Reserve unit may be activated for riot duty. Thankfully, we were not. We lacked even rudimentary training and would have been as ineffective and insensitive as many of the guardsmen and state troopers on the scene. Working through the riots was both frightening and surreal.But the editors failed in the years leading up to the riots to examine or expose the root causes of the unrest. Very little original reporting was done in the black community, while downtown business interests and the suburbs were lavishly covered. When the city exploded, The News lacked black reporters with deep ties to the community to adequately explain the ferment.The people were very distressed. The way the black community was treated on all levels — that was very difficult. The political level was not good, the housing — you know on all levels. You have to feel a compassion for these people that were hurt, that had nowhere else to turn but to raise their voice that way.He has been the Essex County sheriff since 1990 and is a native of Newark. His career in law enforcement started in 1967 as a city police officer, beginning shortly before the riots. He remained with the department for about two decades, becoming a captain and chief assistant to the police director.It was chaotic, to say the least. We were not prepared. We had no equipment. Guys were bringing in their own helmets. Guys were bringing in their own shotguns.To see the devastation that was taking place over the next few days — the burning, the looting, the breaking into stores. It was devastating for those of us who love this city, who live in this city. The fear I had wasn't for my own safety, but for watching the city I loved go up in flames. You begin to realize this is going to take a really long time to recover from.Gov. RICHARD J. HUGHESNew Jersey’s governor from 1962 to 1970, speaking at a news conference as the unrest entered its fifth day.White residents started leaving Newark well before the riots, drawn by the advent of suburbs and the highway system. But researchers said the unrest propelled the exodus and gave the city a dismal reputation. For those who remained, especially African-Americans, the healing process has been slow and difficult.Before the riots, our neighborhood was filled with cops, firemen, construction workers and teachers. They moved because things were expected to get worse (home values, safety). We did not have the financial option to move — my father was a disabled police officer and my mother worked nights at a hospital in East Orange to support her five children. Newark became a fearful place — above-ground walkways to the Gateway buildings from Penn Station. No one wanted to set foot in Newark.In the aftermath — the State Police did their thing and left, and we were left to carry on here, and I think folks in the community did not differentiate between the State Police and the Newark police. We all wore blue. We had to repair some of the damage done by other folks.Our relationship wasn’t great to begin with. You could cut the tension with a knife. I remember being on patrol. It took a long time to develop some trust again. That took long, hard work.One of the sources of frustration was a plan to build a medical school in the Central Ward, which would have occupied more than 150 acres and displaced thousands of residents, most of them black or Hispanic. After the unrest, Mr. Williams, the civil rights activist, argued that black residents were in a position to push back, reducing the school’s footprint and encouraging it to serve the surrounding community.As the smoke cleared and the last dying embers of the flames receded, some of us realized the power structure was afraid. First time they had ever been afraid of us in this city. So we began to think of, how are we are going to take advantage of this violence that nobody wanted? My group was formed, the Newark Area Planning Association, and we decided we were going to work on the medical school. We had to cut that medical school down. Some people didn’t want it at all, but some of us saw it as something valuable.The black community was definitely empowered. Nobody wanted that violence. But at the same time, people were politically adept enough to see that we had the opportunity to turn that destructive power into something that was positive for the community, which if they had just allowed us to do in the beginning, it never would have happened.As I toured Newark after arriving, seeing the devastation I saw, plus the conditions under which many, many people were living in the Central Ward, you could understand why there was an angriness, why there was, you could say, a rebellion. It was pure, pure impoverishment. The lack of attention, you could see it. Go back to Newark now, it’s all different. What an improvement. A positive result did come about because of the riots, but it took years.Ms. Crump, the president of the Newark City Council, was the first African-American woman elected to the council, in 1994. She moved to Newark from Detroit in 1965, and worked for more than 40 years as a Braille teacher at the New Jersey Commission for the Blind and Visually Impaired.There has been significant progress, but not enough, trust me. But there's been progress for African-Americans. Now we’re a black and brown community. Our Hispanic brothers and sisters were part of the progression that we made. For example, my husband and I bought a house in the South Ward where the Jewish community was in prominence. That could never have happened if 1967 had not happened.Last year, the city reached a settlement with the United States Justice Department that led to the appointment of a federal monitor and the implementation of sweeping reforms, including establishing a civilian oversight committee. A three-year investigation highlighted issues similar to those that fueled the riots: Three-fourths of pedestrian stops cited by the police were not justified, minorities were stopped more often than whites and the use of force was underreported.Mr. Haygood, a civil rights lawyer, is the president and chief executive of the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice.The consent decree is such an important document. It’s a 70-page document with more than 100 provisions that contemplate widespread reform in almost every area of policing — in the way officers are trained, in the way officers are disciplined, in the way officers collect and store evidence.Look at the strides the city has made in 50 years, but there’s also a need to look at the underlying issues that led to the Newark rebellion in the first place. If we fail to address those issues, we leave ourselves vulnerable to another rebellion.Mr. Glenn is a Newark police captain and a spokesman for the department.One of the most important lessons that came out of those challenging days is that the racial composition of the Newark Police Division more closely reflects the demographics of our residents. Today, we have a police division comprising 42 percent Hispanic, 37 percent black and the remaining representing whites, Asians and others. And I’m very proud of these numbers because I know that the people of the city of Newark deserve a police division that they can relate to. The us-against-them mentality is markedly reduced when police reflect the community. This didn’t exist in 1967, when only 11 percent of Newark police officers were black in contrast to 50 percent of the city’s residents’ being black at that time.Henry PunkinMr. Punkin, 74, is a retired plumber who moved to Newark from Atlanta when he was 16 years old, and lives in the Springfield/Belmont neighborhood.Has it recovered? Not completely. There are still some emotional trauma and other things we haven’t recovered from and social conditions that led to the rebellion itself. And it hasn’t been fully addressed. Some of the physical and economical circumstances, while they’re not exactly the same as it was, there are vestiges of it and we’ve been moving very rapidly to eliminate all of it.Obviously, some things that exist now didn’t exist then that played into why something like that would not happen again. We don’t have a predominantly white Police Department anymore. You have a predominantly black and brown Police Department — in leadership positions. You still have issues. But some of those officers come from the city of Newark. Their families are here. Those are the things that changed.There’s the social sector of the community that is basically controlled by black and brown people, so that kind of helps mitigate the conditions. But the underlying circumstances that create poverty and homelessness have not completely gone or been addressed adequately. That’s our job to try to get that done.Even though we’re having all these programs to talk about the 50-year anniversary of this rebellion, there hasn’t been any real conversation in New Jersey. Most of those folks have left the city. There has been no conversation with those in the suburbs and those in the city to talk about what caused [the riots], which I think would lead to a deeper discussion about equality in America.I grew up in Newark when it was a thriving commercial and manufacturing hub, a city of vast parks, strong schools, wonderful branch libraries and viable neighborhoods, all except the Central Ward, the deliberately overlooked ground-zero ghetto. This all went away with the riots. My family moved to the suburbs in 1957, so we escaped the immediacy of the destruction, but felt its impact for a lifetime.She is a lawyer for the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, where she works on criminal justice reform. She has lived in the city for a year and a half.I really like the diversity of Newark, and the fact that, even though it's a very large city — the largest city in New Jersey — it feels like a small town. When you walk around here, I'll bump into 10 people I know anytime I walk outside. Each of the wards has a different feel, a different flavor.Even though there is skepticism from a great deal of people who have been hurt before, I think there is also this competing hope, where people are hopeful that maybe this time, with the vibrancy and intergenerational nature with a lot of these coalitions, we can get some reforms going. ​I'm sick and tired of talking about the riots. It was 50 years ago. The day we stop talking about the riots, that's the day we make a full comeback.The violence was believed to have started after the arrest of a Negro cabdriver on charges of assaulting a policeman. The crowd of Negroes that gathered outside the Fourth Precinct station house protested the arrest and some persons shouted “police brutality!”The mob that gathered around the station house threw rocks and bottles. At least five policemen were struck by stones, one policeman reported.Mayor Hugh J. Addonizio telephoned Gov. Richard J. Hughes at 2:20 a.m. and told the governor that the rampaging Negroes who had looted, burned and smashed their way through the city in the second straight night of violence had produced an “ominous situation.”Gov. Richard J. Hughes declared Newark a city in “criminal insurrection” as the fighting and looting continued despite a curfew and the presence of armed troops. The violence was the nation’s worst racial outbreak since the rioting in the Watts section of Los Angeles in 1965.The governor, red with anger, said shortly before midnight that it was time that the people of Newark chose between the terrorists and law and order.“This is a criminal insurrection by people who say they hate the white man but who really hate America,” Governor Hughes charged.Nearly half of Newark’s 23.7 square miles was an occupied zone. As sporadic sniping continued, guardsmen and policemen — weary and trigger-quick after days and nights of tension — were reported to have engaged each other in several accidental gunfights.Although the city appeared to be returning to normal, there was yet another fatal incident early today. A Negro was shot and killed by the police in the Negro section while allegedly attempting to loot a store. His death was the 26th since the rioting began Wednesday.Jack Begg contributed research.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
