AdvertisementBlack political power is declining in cities across the country, including Oakland, St. Louis, Cleveland and Atlanta — even as African-Americans are gaining majority status in an increasing number of suburbs.At the same time, African-American emigration to the South has started to weaken Republican control of some deep red states.AdvertisementAdvertisementIn the report, McElwee argues thatThe fact that big donors — overwhelmingly white, male and high-income — hold such outsized influence in a city that is extremely diverse both demographically and economically is deeply problematic.At the same time, Bowser lost the three poorest black wards (5,7 and 8), which have a median household income of $42,177 and where single family houses cost an average of $250,000 in 2013, by large margins. Ward 7, across the Anacostia River in the Southeast corner of the city, backed Gray over Bowser 59.48 percent to 28.0 percent.Hispanics, who are likely to hold the balance of political power between whites and blacks, have grown from 2.1 percent of the District’s population in 1970 to 10.6 percent in 2015. Asian-Americans have gone from 0.7 percent to 4.2 percent over the same period.AdvertisementWhile these percentages still give African-Americans a plurality of the District population, turnout patterns in off-year local elections in which the mayor is chosen serve to weaken black voting strength.The turnout gap between rich and poor wards was even larger, 7.84 points in the 2014 contest. In the most affluent four wards (median household income $95,257), the turnout rate of registered voters was 30.83 percent; in the four poorest wards (median household income $49,520), the turnout rate was 22.99 percent.A surge of young, mainly white voters living in newly affluent neighborhoods emerged as a powerful force in last November’s elections in the District, a seismic shift that mirrors the evolution of the city’s population and could reshape its politics in years to come.The Post found that in the 2014 primary, blacks made up 48 percent of voters compared to 51 percent “other.” In the general election, which included a referendum on legalization of marijuana that brought many young white voters to the polls, blacks were 46 percent to 53 percent “other.”In the event of a future racially polarized Democratic mayoral primary pitting a major black candidate against a major white candidate, Hispanics would be in a position to determine the outcome.There are some indications of how Hispanic voters might cast their ballots. The February 1989 Chicago mayoral primary provides perhaps the most relevant case study.AdvertisementIn an email, Piston wrote that the “findings constitute suggestive evidence” that in a white vs. black election, Hispanics could provide “a victory for the white candidate, because Latinos tend to view whites more favorably than blacks.”Piston cautioned, however, that the policies espoused by the white and black candidates could also play a crucial role:Latinos are more egalitarian than whites and more comfortable with big government. If the black candidate was to the left of the white candidate in the scenario you describe with respect to these two core values, and if Latinos voted with these two core values in mind, this would draw Latinos on balance to the black candidate.I contacted a number of politicians, operatives, researchers and political scientists to get their assessment of the likelihood that the District will elect a white mayor and got a mixed response.I see no reason why the city can’t elect a white mayor. While I in no way think we are in a post racial era, I do believe that most of the citizens of the city would have no genuine bias on this issue. In fact, the younger folks who have made up most of the city’s growth spurt are far more welcoming of differences than their elders. Like any successful mayoral candidate, the politician would have to speak to issues relevant to those in the city with a plan to tackle crime, affordable housing and continue the improvement in the business climate to achieve job growth, etc. but I certainly think it could be done.Matthew Green, a political scientist at Catholic University, said the prospect of a white mayor is “absolutely, clearly possible.” He noted that major sections of the city have been transformed, in most cases resulting in more whites:The city has been changing pretty dramatically. There are neighborhoods I don’t even recognize anymore.There are, however, some dissenters.Garry Young, director of the Center for Washington Area Studies at George Washington University, downplayed the possibility that Washington could elect a white mayor, noting thatAfrican-American’s remain the largest racial group in the District with close to 50 percent. Non-Hispanic whites still only make up a tad more than one third.Young also pointed out thatThe dynamic that seems in play now is you have black candidates who attract the business community and white voters in Northwest and then do well enough among black and Latino voters elsewhere to win the Democratic primary. That’s a proven winning strategy. Could a white candidate put together the same sort of coalition? Possibly — and one day probably as I think the District’s continues to become whiter — but I think it’s still a long-shot in the short run.Hal Wolman, a political scientist at George Washington put an entirely different spin on the question:One of the biggest differences is on the question whether blacks and white have the same opportunities for jobs: 74 percent of whites say yes compared to 40 percent of blacks. Another major difference is on the question of whether the American system of justice is biased against African-Americans. Blacks say it is, by 68 to 26, while 69 percent of whites say the system in not biased, and 25 percent say it is.Despite the particular demographic profile of the District, the population trends in Washington are emblematic of shifts taking place in a number of major cities.AdvertisementThe geographic movement of African-Americans will produce a shift in black political power from some cities to surrounding suburbs and to states in the South.Georgia, for example, is a state where Democrats are making gains, so much so that the Clinton campaign is considering a possible drive to win what has been a solidly red state. The slow but steady increase in the percentage of Georgia residents who are minorities is crucial to this process.By far the dominant trend, however, is the migration of African-Americans from center cities to the suburbs.metropolitan areas in the growing parts of the country are registering the greatest numeric gains in suburban black population. The suburbs of Atlanta, Houston, Washington, D.C., and Dallas experienced the largest increases in black population during 2000-2010.AdvertisementDriving the movement of African-Americans to the suburbs, Frey wrote,are the young, those with higher education, and married couples with children — attributes that characterized white suburbanization for almost a century.Politically, the migration out of cities to the suburbs will lead to some diffusion of black political power, but not necessarily to a diminishment.Over time, African-Americans in the Washington metropolitan area may be forced through demographic change to cede some power in the District, which has a population of 672,228. At the same time, African-American control of Prince George’s County might be an avatar of a deeper transformation. The county not only has a population of 909,535, but it also has a member of Congress who can actually vote, unlike the District’s quasi-congressional representation. By most standards, this is not a bad deal.A focus on the black-white-Hispanic urban splits can serve to obscure what is possibly a more salient development: the ongoing political alignment of well-educated, relatively well-off whites with racial and ethnic minorities. It is this racially and ethnically diverse urban-metropolitan coalition that currently supports Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party and that elected Barack Obama twice. It is viscerally opposed to Donald Trump.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

As both traditional and cosmopolitan values form the basis of alliances that sometimes compete and sometimes cooperate, the opportunities for a peaceful reshaping of coalitions on both the left and the right are there. But as conflicts related to economic and social modernization erupt at locations as far apart as Ferguson and Falluja, the potential is also clear for ever more dangerous conflict.See More »Go to Home Page »
