AdvertisementBut Trump, according to Tulis, is “unique in that no other previous major party presidential candidate has felt so unconstrained by these constitutional norms.”AdvertisementAdvertisementConstraints that would have prevented the nomination of a candidate like Trump have been removed — by party and ideological polarization; by the weakening of the political parties as organizations; and by the fact that primary voters, rather than party bosses or even more ideologically oriented party activists, now have the power to choose the Republican nominee. In the past, party organizations were strong enough to filter out contenders as aberrant as Trump. Evidently, no longer.”Perhaps most important is the acquiescence of the Republican Party and of a large segment of the voting public to Trump’s flagrant disregard for democratic procedure in politics and governing.Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.is not his determination to close the doors to immigration (that has all too many precedents in the American past), or his criticism of open world-trade agreements (that, too, is closer to the historical norm of U.S. policy than is commonly imagined), or the barely disguised racism (which was his entry, via the Birther movement, into national politics).What is most distinctive is the strongman, authoritarian style of politics that he radiates so strongly both in the bigger-than-life-or-politics persona he projects and the trust-me, I’ll fix everything and make us great again, program he promises.Economic issues are arguably foremost. For the majority of men and women dependent on wages to stay afloat, the past 16 years have been marked by setbacks and uncertainty of historic proportion.After 2000, the economy would experience two recessions, a technology-bubble collapse followed by a housing boom, then the largest financial crisis in 75 years and a prolonged period of weak growth.AdvertisementThe solutions Trump has offered to such problems are far removed from realistic government policy. Instead, Trump puts forward name-calling, taunts, mockery, threats, insults, hostility to Mexicans and Muslims, and barely constrained contempt for women.Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Trump, or Trumpism, is the residue of that burnout — thick with the nativism, racism, and authoritarianism that were always there.AdvertisementOne of the “most egregious misreadings of Trump is that he is part of the populist tradition of Andrew Jackson,” Wilentz pointed out, noting that Jackson battled the Second Bank of the United States “to remove the hands of unelected private bankers from the levers of the federal treasury”; that he “took on the most powerful reactionary slaveholders of his day"; and that he helped build “the first mass democratic political party in the history of the world.”In this light, according to Wilentz,to link Jackson to a narcissistic reality show mogul who cashed in on fast and loose dealings in real estate and gambling casinos, who has opposed no reactionaries of any kind, and whose idea of an intellectual appears to be Don King and Mike Ditka — well, all of that is worse than travesty.Trump, Wilentz concludes, is just “the sort of gouger and business sharper that the Populists organized to stop.”Heather Cox Richardson, a professor of history at Boston College, argues that Trump “represents the final collapse of the Movement Conservatism that took over the Republican Party in the 1980s.”The conservative movement, Richardson writes, had a built-in conflict that it failed to resolve. In order to win white working class support for deregulation and smaller government, Republican leaders had to make the casethat an activist government redistributed wealth from hardworking white men to lazy African-Americans, women and organized workers.The Trump phenomenon, Richardson suggests, isa snapshot of the moment voters realize that they have been duped. He plays virulently on the racism and sexism of Movement Conservatism, using the language and the resentments rank-and-file Republican voters have internalized for a generation. But he also echoes their anger that they have been destroyed economically by the policies of the past 35 years.The platform renounces the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing same-sex marriage; supports “therapy” for gay minors; rejects “redefining sex discrimination to include sexual orientation or other categories”; and declares that “our laws and our government’s regulations should recognize marriage as the union of one man and one woman.”The conservative thrust of the platform goes far beyond social issues, calling for a wall to “cover the entirety of the southern border” that is “sufficient to stop both vehicular and pedestrian traffic”; an increase in coal production — labeling coal “an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource”; an expansion of energy exploration on public lands; opposition to “ill-conceived laws that would restrict magazine capacity or ban the sale of the most popular and common modern rifle”; enactment of “firearm reciprocity legislation to recognize the right of law-abiding Americans to carry firearms to protect themselves and their families in all 50 states”; and a “human life amendment to the Constitution” to ban abortion, without exemption for rape, incest or saving the life of the mother.Trump is a sick sociopath. He has no conscience. No feelings of guilt, remorse, empathy or embarrassment.See More »Go to Home Page »
