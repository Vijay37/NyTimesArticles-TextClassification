Mr. Washington, next in “The Iceman Cometh” on Broadway, and Mr. Jordan, the “Black Panther” star, discuss their idols, black superheroes and #MeToo.“It was a big highlight,” Michael B. Jordan said, then looked down shyly into his lap.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Mr. Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the O.G. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Finally, Mr. Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Mr. Washington. In a career spanning more than 40 years and 50 films — and kicked off by the hit TV drama “St. Elsewhere” — Mr. Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in “Training Day” and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in “Glory.” And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the last two years.AdvertisementAdvertisementOver a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Mr. Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Mr. Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them.
