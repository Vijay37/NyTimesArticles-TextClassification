Essentially, he wanted to know what the candidates would do to meet the nation’s energy needs in an environmentally friendly manner without throwing a lot of people out of work. Mr. Trump’s answer came straight from the Tea Party playbook: The Environmental Protection Agency is “killing our energy business.” Hillary Clinton, he added, “wants to put all the miners out of business.” He’d figure out ways to make the coal under American soil last another 1,000 years.Mrs. Clinton said she would not “walk away” from the job losses among miners and workers at coal-fired power plants. But she said she couldn’t walk away from climate change, either. (Addressing that problem means more clean energy, less coal and more suffering in coal country.) Mr. Bone, a plain-spoken guy, managed to get plain, if wildly different, responses on issues that were in danger of disappearing.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
