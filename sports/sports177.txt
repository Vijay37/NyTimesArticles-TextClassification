The Wolverines’ story will continue to be the chatter of the nation for as long as this group keeps finding new ways to win while busting laymen’s tournament brackets.Cinderellas they are not. This is a Big Ten program that played in the national title game four years ago — a game that, coincidentally enough, the Wolverines lost to Louisville. That 2013 tournament run was the most recent to end for Beilein in gut-wrenching fashion thanks to Cardinals Coach Rick Pitino. Beilein was West Virginia’s coach in 2005 when the Mountaineers also lost to Louisville — in overtime in the round of 8.“We definitely wanted to get this win for Coach B,” the senior Zak Irvin said of Beilein, adding: “Coach Pitino’s a great coach, but for us to come out here and be so resilient against that Louisville team, it speaks to our type of team.”Michigan is a team that can often shoot its way out of trouble, ranking third in Division I in adjusted offensive efficiency, according to the statistician Ken Pomeroy’s ratings. The Wolverines can often rely on the senior point guard Derrick Walton Jr. to make big plays, too.But Michigan shot just 35 percent from beyond the 3-point arc against the Cardinals, and Walton — who finished with 10 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists — made just 3 of 13 field-goal attempts.The Wolverines made up for the shortcomings by protecting the ball, committing just six turnovers against a Louisville team that, according to Pomeroy, ranks No. 8 in adjusted defensive efficiency.Before Sunday’s game, Beilein wrote a simple mantra on the whiteboard: “Why not us?”“That’s the attitude,” Beilein said, still soaked from the victory celebration. “We’re going to keep going with it and try to do everything we can not to ever let this run stop.”Michigan moves on to face Oregon on Thursday in Kansas City, Mo.Swim gear may be advisable.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
