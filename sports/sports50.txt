Brody of the United States District Court in Philadelphia, said in her order.The ruling “is to protect the interests of class members by recognizing that class members receiving monetary awards are by definition cognitively impaired,” she wrote.The judge instructed the administrator overseeing the settlement to not pay the lenders, in effect absolving the players of repaying the loans.“We are pleased with the court’s decision, which will protect the interests of class members from practices our investigation to date has uncovered to be predatory and potentially illegal,” Seeger said in a statement on Friday.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
