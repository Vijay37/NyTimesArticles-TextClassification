That’s why we have scoured the internet for political writing from the right and left that you might not have seen.Has this series exposed you to new ideas?“After two days and almost six hours of high-stakes public testimony, I’m struck by the total lack of any compelling claims supporting the ‘big’ collusion narrative.”_____“Trump-critics cannot demand Sessions’ recusal on the one hand, and then ignore the more glaring conflict at the center of Mueller’s role in this now Comey-dominated matter.”To make the point that Robert S. Mueller III should resign as special counsel investigating possible links between the Trump campaign and Russia, Mr. Barnes poses these questions to President Trump’s critics: “Would you be ok with Trump’s counsel Michael Cohen as special counsel? How about any other longtime Trump friend and ally?”_____“Hate President Trump all you like for whatever laundry list of crimes you care to ascribe to him, real or imagined. Carry signs in the streets and attack the institution of the presidency. But assassination porn which graphically depicts bloody, horrific violence is apparently one bridge too far.”_____“Since Democrats can be counted on to reflexively oppose this Republican president, my message here is aimed primarily at patriotic Republicans: It’s time to take a stand, if you care about things like separation of powers, the rule of law, and preserving norms and the balance of power.”_____“To play the vital role contemplated for them by our constitutional system, intellectual and political elites have a long way to go in regaining the people’s trust.”_____“Sessions’s inability to recall or remember details ostensibly key to the Senate Intelligence Committee’s investigation served as the chorus to his testimony, repeated at various times throughout Tuesday’s hearing without any hint of irony or embarrassment.”_____“Trump will probably not fire Mueller right away.

They are the first tremors of a profound ideological realignment from which a progressive majority could well emerge.”_____“The special-counsel regulations under which Mueller was appointed were written precisely to address a situation like this one. I would know; I wrote them, in 1999.”_____“In the hope that this proves to be an irrelevant exercise, I sketch below what I think would happen if Trump did, in fact, decide he wanted Mueller gone.”_____“What should be done about these twin threats — global terrorism and global warming — of the 21st Century? Abandon the precautionary approach that seeks to attack the problem at its root.”_____“A chilling effect has already taken place at comedy clubs across the country. Comedians talk of employing a new calculus: Is this a pro-Trump crowd or an anti-Trump crowd? And if it’s the wrong one, will I bomb — or worse?”_____AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
