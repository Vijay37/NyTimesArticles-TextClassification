AdvertisementMorocco's first World Cup victory in Russia could come off the field.On the eve of the tournament, Morocco is hoping to beat a North American bid for the right to stage the 2026 World Cup. Then it's the duty of the players to perform in Group B in the country's first trip to the World Cup in two decades.Qualification was secured by beating Ivory Coast in a winner-take-all encounter. Intriguingly, only one of the 11 players who started in Ivory Coast was born in Morocco. Lacking a superstar, Morocco often finds its best players in France, the Netherlands and Spain, where they parents emigrated to.Most of the squad wasn't born when Morocco became the first African team to win a group at the World Cup, finishing ahead of England, Poland and Portugal in 1986.Portugal, the reigning European champion, awaits Morocco again this time in Group B, in between games against Iran and 2010 World Cup winner Spain.AdvertisementHere's a closer look at the Morocco team:COACHHerve Renard is capable of pulling a team lacking out-and-out stars together to form a formidable unit.AdvertisementThe 49-year-old Frenchman has had success with far more underrated squads than Morocco's. He led unheralded Zambia to the African title in 2012 and then led Ivory Coast to the continental title three years later.While there's no doubt Renard is a good tactician, he's better known for his passion and flamboyant antics on the sidelines. Watch out for a possible revival of one of his superstitions for major tournaments: the lucky shirt.At the African Cup of Nations six years ago with Zambia, Renard embraced a white shirt that he said gave his team luck and he wore it for every game the Zambians played on the way to the title.GOALKEEPERSSpanish-born Munir Mohamedi is likely to remain the No. 1 choice for the World Cup. That's the logical decision after he didn't concede a goal in six games in the final round of qualifying.Mohamedi plays in the Spanish second division for Numancia, while understudy Yassine Bounou plays in the top league with Girona. Bounou could have represented Canada after being born in Montreal.DEFENDERSThe entire team seems built around captain Mehdi Benatia, the Juventus center back who was born in France but with Moroccan heritage.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Saiss can also be utilized as a defensive midfielder to provide an extra line of protection.AdvertisementThe wing backs have generated much excitement in Morocco: 19-year-old Achraf Hakimi of Real Madrid on the right and 20-year-old Hamza Mendyl of Lille on the opposite flank.MIDFIELDERSMbark Boussoufa is the heartbeat of the midfield and has a claim alongside Benatia to be the team's most important player.Born in the Netherlands, Boussoufa has spent more than a decade in the team and has experience of conditions in Russia. He spent five years with Anzhi Makhachkala and Lokomotiv Moscow.Also expect Younes Belhanda to play a key role in a five-man midfield with the pacey Nordin Amrabat and Hakim Ziyech operating as wingers.FORWARDSWith five in midfield, Khalid Boutaib might be the lone striker on the team sheet, although that didn't bother him in the decisive round of qualifying with four goals in six games.Renard could be tempted, however, to play two up front and give the 24-year-old forward Ayoub el-Kaabi a chance after he scored an eye-opening nine goals in six games in his first international tournament, albeit the lower-level African Nations Championship in January and February.GROUP GAMESAfter opening on June 15 against Iran, Morocco will take on its closest northerly neighbors, Portugal, on June 20. The team will then face Spain on June 25.___More AP World Cup coverage: www.apnews.com/tag/WorldCupGo to Home Page Â»
