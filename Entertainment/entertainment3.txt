Excluding the accounting changes, revenue would have been $38.9 billion.Analysts expected revenue of $39.31 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Shares of the Dallas-based company fell more than 3 percent to $34.05 after the bell.The company, which owns satellite television service DirecTV, lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers, fewer than the 257,000 customers analysts had expected them to lose, according to research firm FactSet.As more viewers seek to cut pay-TV packages, AT&T added 312,000 customers to its DirecTV Now streaming service.The Time Warner deal, which would give AT&T access to content like HBO's "Game of Thrones" and Warner Bros' "Justice League," reflects AT&T's effort to compete for advertising dollars against Alphabet's Google and Facebook.AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson surprised investors last week when he said during trial testimony that the company would introduce a new video service called AT&T Watch, a package of TV channels without sports, for $15 per month.(Reporting by Sheila Dang in New York and Pushkala Aripaka in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Scott Malone)AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisementTwo prominent Hollywood production companies have acquired the rights to produce a film based on The New York Times’s coverage of sexual misconduct by Harvey Weinstein, The Times confirmed on Thursday.The rights were bought by Plan B, a production company co-founded by Brad Pitt that produced “12 Years a Slave” and “Moonlight,” and Annapurna Pictures, founded by Megan Ellison, the company behind “Zero Dark Thirty” and “Phantom Thread.”A weekly newsletter on women, gender and society.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

Net profit rose 23.4 percent versus forecasts of 19.5 percent.Baidu said it now expects second-quarter revenues of between 24.91 billion yuan ($3.93 billion) and 26.19 billion yuan ($4.13 billion), indicating a 19.3-25.4 percent rise versus estimates of a 15.9 percent climb according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The search firm's news feed received an unexpected bump in the first quarter due to a crackdown by Chinese internet regulators on low-brow content, which saw several competing apps targeted during a key client-acquisition period.Jinri Toutiao, one of China's most popular news feed apps and a key Baidu rival, is among the apps to have been punished by censors this year. The news feed platform was temporarily removed from local app stores earlier this month."This is a one-off, but the timing is quite interesting. Baidu in its marketing can now assure clients that at least on the feed side it has safer content," said Pacific Epoch analyst Raymond Feng, adding it made the firm "a more reliable choice".Analysts said the early year bump boded well for the rest of 2018, as advertisers tended to sign year-long contracts.During a conference call with analysts on Friday, Chief Executive Robin Li said the company has employed artificial intelligence technology to target click-bait and inappropriate content. Baidu removed 20.2 billion malicious web pages in 2017."We proactively clean up indecent content and limit the volume of entertainment gossip news in one sweep... We use AI to identify and remove clickbait and vulgar content... We believe such a strategy will pay off in the long run," said Li.The helping hand from censors is in stark contrast to Baidu's woes two years ago, when regulators cracked down on its advertising practices, gutting its marketing client base and bringing its revenue growth to a grinding halt.The company has since sold or withdrawn from a number of businesses to focus on autonomous driving, AI and its news feed product, regaining momentum and investor confidence.Baidu's total revenue rose about 24 percent to 20.91 billion yuan in the three months to March 31, its slowest rate in three quarters despite topping analyst estimates.The positive results also reflect lower-than-expected research and development expenses, which have sky-rocketed since Baidu's pivot to AI due to steep costs hiring top talent.Content costs linked to Baidu's newly listed entertainment subsidiary iQiyi Inc are also expected to squeeze its margins for the foreseeable future, amid stiff competition in online content from rival Tencent Holdings Ltd.Excluding one-time items, Baidu reported earnings of 16.30 yuan per American depositary share, above expectations of 10.57 yuan.Baidu's net income was also boosted by a new accounting standard that requires companies to report the value of their investments in private companies.($1 = 6.3405 Chinese yuan renminbi)(Reporting by Cate Cadell in BEIJING; Additional reporting by Munsif Vengattil in BENGALURU; Editing by Sai Sachin Ravikumar and Christopher Cushing)AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONSAdvertisement(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc reported better-than-expected first-quarter results on Tuesday as the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier lost fewer monthly phone subscribers than feared, and the company's chief financial officer said it was continuing to explore a new video service.Shares of the company rose 1.8 percent to $49.55.Verizon lost 24,000 phone subscribers who pay a monthly bill, while analysts expected it to lose 69,000 subscribers, according to financial and data analytics firm FactSet.Speaking on the post-earnings conference call, Verizon Chief Financial Officer Matthew Ellis said the company was not interested at this time in acquiring broadcast or cable networks, but continued to look at "over-the-top" options, or cheaper streaming video packages with fewer channels.Verizon was a bidder for Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets, which Walt Disney Co is trying to buy for $52.4 billion.AdvertisementThe company expects to have an overall product offering for consumers in the three to five markets where it plans to launch home 5G broadband later this year, and will add more content to Oath, its subsidiary that owns Yahoo! and AOL, Ellis said.AdvertisementThat could include news, sports, finance or entertainment content, Ellis said in an interview.Analysts questioned whether Verizon had its sights on traditional media similar to AT&T Inc, which is fighting in court against the U.S. Department of Justice to close its acquisition of Time Warner Inc, and while Ellis said the company would look at potential deals, it is not the main focus.Verizon instead expects to add to its distribution rights for digital content, Ellis said.Net income attributable to Verizon rose to $4.55 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $3.45 billion, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.
