Trevor Anderson, a chart manager at Billboard focused on R&B and hip-hop, said, “We haven’t seen a song from someone brand new go up the charts this quick since Meghan Trainor,” noting that was typically the preserve of more established stars like Justin Bieber or Rihanna. That it happened “without a meme, without a dance, it makes it that much weirder,” he added.Cardi B has a thick voice — she swells her syllables until they take up all available space, and moves on and off the beat stealthily. Generally, she chops up her lines into small pieces — “They see pictures, they say, ‘Goals,’ bitch, I’m who they tryna be” — making more entry points, turning each into a sort of mini-chorus.Those are two different segments of New York’s music culture, and part of the reason Cardi B can move so effortlessly between them is that in a genre largely marked by heavy Southern inflections and intonations, she still speaks with the reassuring contours of New York street slang, filtered through a Spanish accent.Mr. Bieber’s addition to “Despacito” — an English-language star singing partly in Spanish — helped propel it to the top of the chart, but Cardi B might have a different approach in mind. This month, she released a Spanish remix of “Bodak Yellow” featuring the Dominican-American rapper Messiah, one of the key figures in the Latin trap movement. That genre — in essence, a Spanish-language version of American hip-hop — has been gaining popularity over the last couple of years, but it might be “Bodak Yellow” that gives it its breakout moment.Soon after its release, Spanish-language radio stations began playing “Bodak Yellow,” Mr. Bakula noted. That means that turning this English song Spanish may be the thing to take it to the top of the chart — a kind of reverse “Despacito” in the making.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
