Oil and banking billionaire George Kaiser 74 believes in luckHis Jewish family escaped Nazi Germany  nip and tuck he said and Kaiser was the first child  be born in America The way he tells it he found himself in charge of the KaiserFrancis Oil Company and BOK Financial Corporation mostly  happenstance  lucky  be born in wealth and  have unwittingly joined a bank board at an opportune time  and day he ranks 61 on the Forbes 400 list For Kaiser America was the land of opportunity but he is acutely aware that others are not so privilegedKaiser has signed the Bill Gates Giving Pledge  devote much of his remaining net worth which Forbes estimates  be 79 billion  charity but in contrast with Gatess global giving Kaiser focuses efforts in his homewn of Tulsa OklaKaiser pours money in Tulsa  rather than a more impoverished thirdworld country  because he believes his foundation can better identify needs and more easily monir results in his own communityThe charitable world does not have good accountability Kaiser ld me during an interview this fall Theres not a good single judgment of what success is In business you make lots of money thats deemed  be the measure of success But in social service its a lot more subtle You have anecdotal success that the executive direcr believes in and wants  convince you of when time comes for you  reinvest but its so much more difficult Plus the problems are far more intractable and endemic than the problems of the business worldAccountability he noted is the rationalized reason he donates locally But he said Jewish guilt likely drives him as well since a Tulsa businessman sponsored his familys escape from Nazi GermanyKaisers father Herman was a German judge who was disbarred under the Nuremberg Laws Herman went  work for a successful shoemaker and stayed in Germany until the end of 1938 after KristallnachtThe Kaiser family moved  America with sponsorship from a Tulsa oilman named Sam Miller Herman Kaiser went  work for Millers small company Francis Oil and Gas Inc which was then dormant After the war Herman began working in pipe trading even traveling back  Germany  negotiate for steel goodsKaiser speaks about his own rise  prominence in strictly selfdeprecating terms He rarely speaks  the press and his appearance is more professor than plucrat In Tulsa you could pass him on the street without noticing  and most do He likes it that way he said hes never needed security On the subjects of charity and inequality he was verbose But when asked about his personal life he crunched the empty plastic cup in front of him visibly uncomfortable Cant stand the subject he saidWhen Kaiser finished graduate school at Harvard in 1966 he went home  the family oil business unsure what he wanted  do and uncertain about his future during the Vietnam War After his father had a heart attack Kaiser ok over the businessIn 1980 he joined the board of the National Bank of Tulsa Eleven years and one massive oil and gas crisis later Kaiser saw that the bank was in trouble and would likely be purchased  an oufstate owner so he bought controlIt was pretty high risk The world was falling apart at that point he said The primary motivation was  preserve an institution here A more local bank he believed would make loans based on borrowers reputation and credit compared  oufstate banks which would make impersonal calculations and secure loans with collateralKaiser runs his charitable organization much in the way he runs the bank locally and personally but with deference  data His focus is on brain development in children age 03 because research shows improvements at a young age yield the best results for societyI spoke  two young mothers attending Union High School an alternative education program partnering with the Kaiser Foundation Nataly Ledesma 17 became pregnant when she was 13 and her sister Linda 18 became pregnant soon after The sisters say they grew up without much attention at home and were awestruck at the parenting lessons theyve received at school such as positive discipline and how  read  their childrenI want my child  be someone Nataly said We have someone  show us that better way instead of trying  figure it out on our ownIf Kaiser could change one structural aspect of the country he said hed eliminate the attitude that centralized control is inherently evil He agrees with the populist concept that people have equal character and judgment but he said the corollary  that concept  that no one should tell you what  do  has morphed in an encumbering fear of the federal government Hes fought  increase taxes on Oklahoma oil and gas producersOf course Kaiser has his own frustrations with federal policy For instance he said some entitlements are o expensive Social Security and Medicare were created at a time when the elderly were the poorest in society he said but the programs have become antiquated as they now act as transfers from the relatively poorer young people  the relatively more wealthy older generationThese days he says he splits time evenly between his businesses and charitable foundation A 70  80 hour workweek doesnt leave time for pleasure he noted adding that was the reason hed peppered our interview with wisecracks My relaxation time he smiled He proudly recalled his eighth grade teachers grade comments Keen and inquisitive mind but often seeks  disturb the class with irrelevant remarks and capersI still like capers a lot he addedThis spring before Bob Dylan won the Nobel prize the George Kaiser Family Foundation acquired Dylans archive Kaiser liked that Dylans music expressed antiestablishment sentiments  the type of work Kaiser has been assembling for years through the foundations Woody Guthrie Center in Tulsa Guthrie was one of Dylans earliest influencesKaiser says his foundation will likely finish spending after his death so that his objectives dont become obsolete But for now the foundation continues doing the local work person  person program  program Even as federal administrations change and fads in foundation spending come and go Kaisers program focuses on data  get resultsPerhaps before the foundation spends its last dollar Kaisers solutions will have caught on across the countryThis blog expands on Nicholas Krisfs twiceweekly columns sharing thoughts that shape the writing but dont always make it in the 800word text Its also the place where readers make their voices heardWhy wait for governments or established charities when you can start an NGO in your

It has offices in a sleek Manhattan skyscraper Its bonds are accessible  millions of American invesrs And it holds ties  some of New Yorks biggest banksDespite this presence on Wall Street detailed in previously unreported financial records Vnesheconombank or VEB is no normal bank It is wholly owned  the Russian state It is intertwined with Russian intelligence And the Russian prime minister is  law the chairman of its supervisory boardNow VEB is at the center of an international firesrm that threatens the Trump presidency because the banks chief  a prominent graduate of Russias spy school  met with Jared Kushner President Trumps soninlaw during the presidential transition That meeting is a focus of a federal counterintelligence investigation about possible collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian governmentThree years ago in response  Moscows military intervention in Ukraine the Obama administration imposed sanctions on VEB that have effectively kept it from taking on most new business in the United States Since then however VEB has quietly kept up appearances on Wall Street in the event that sanctions would be lifted according  interviews with American bankers and former government officialsThat moment appeared  be nearing with Mr Trumps vicry And so the banks chief Sergey N rkov traveled  New York in December for what he described as a roadshow promoting the bank that was largely hinged on the prospect of improved diplomatic and business relationships between the United States and RussiaDuring that trip The New York Times has found Mr rkov met with bankers at JPMorgan Chase Citigroup and another unidentified American financial institution ldman Sachs bankers also tried  arrange a meeting but ultimately had a scheduling conflict The meetings which are not prohibited  sanctions were confirmed  three people briefed on the discussions but unauthorized  speak publicly about themNone of the American banks were new  VEB Citi and JPMorgan had long established relationships clearing financial transactions for VEB in the United States activities not affected  the sanctions And before the sanctions securities filings show ldman and others had helped the Russian bank issue bonds activity that was blocked  the sanctions and that VEB was eager  resumeAfter a few painful years continuing Western borrowing had become a pressing priority for Moscow The Russian Finance Ministry has spent about 10 billion  prop up the bank over the past three years according  banking analystsOn that same trip Mr rkov met with Mr Kushner The nature of the meeting which remains in dispute followed a session between Mr Kushner and the Russian ambassador Sergey I Kislyak about opening a communications channel with Russian officials during the presidential transition according  current and former American officialsThe FBI and congressional investigars are now scrutinizing whether Mr Kushner may have met with Mr rkov  help establish a direct line  Russias president Vladimir V Putin or for other reasons not cited  the White HouseThe White House and VEB have issued contradicry statements about the purpose of the rkov meetingThe White House has said that Mr Kislyak requested the meeting and that Mr Kushner was acting in his capacity as a transition official But VEB said Mr rkov had met with Mr Kushner who was still running his familys real estate company  discuss business The statement said VEBs management had met with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business circles of the US a claim supported  the Timess reporting about Mr rkovs meetings with banks in New YorkVEB has not disclosed specifics of the conversation with Mr Kushner which is of keen interest  investigarsThe subject of sanctions was also freshly pical in December The rolling back of sanctions was an essential part of Mr rkovs strategy in visiting New York and was central  the health of his bank The next month during Mr Trumps first week in office administration officials signaled they were considering lifting the sanctions that stemmed from the conflict in UkraineSeparately Michael T Flynn the former national security adviser had several phone conversations late last year with Mr Kislyak the Russian ambassador In one the two men discussed additional sanctions imposed  the Obama administration in response  the Russian governments efforts  disrupt the 2016 presidential electionThe meeting with Mr Kushner was not VEBs only connection  Mr Trumps campaign or associatesA banker who pleaded guilty last year  spying for Russia out of VEBs office in New York was part of an unsuccessful Russian scheme  recruit Carter  an American businessman who later became a Trump campaign adviser as a spy VEB also obtained shares in a Ukrainian steel smelter when it was sold  a business partner of Mr Trumps who built a Trump hotel in Toron according  previously undisclosed documents from the vast leak known as the Panama Papers The VEB involvement in the smelter deal was first reported  The Wall Street JournalThese interactions have stirred concerns over whether the bank which few Americans have heard of despite its ties  Wall Street and big companies like Boeing has been spreading Russian influence along with its financial footprintA representative for the bank would not commentVEB and Mr Putin are inextricably linkedThe bank stepped up lending after 2008 when Mr Putin then prime minister became chairman of the board And during the oil boom VEB was seen as embodying Russias new financial mightUnder a 2007 law VEBs mandate was  lend  important but underfinanced secrs of the Russian economy including infrastructure and businesses that help diversify the economy beyond oil dependenceThere are other governmentcontrolled banks in Russia Sberbank and VTB but they are primarily retail banks VEB serves a very different role lending mostly  large borrowers many of them politically connectedTo that end VEB over the last decade has lent freely in ways that dovetail with government priorities and make it a ol of Russian soft power The purse strings opened for two influential groups in particular oligarchs building Olympic sites in Sochi and companies in Russianspeaking eastern UkraineThis is not a bank said Karen Vartapev a public finance analyst at Standard  Poors We should rather treat this bank as a government agency It is used  the government as a ol  invest in politically and socially important but not always financially viable projectsVEBs role as a projecr of state influence was on display in 2010 with a deal that potentially affected a Trump hotel in ToronAt the time Alex Shnaider a RussianCanadian businessman developing the hotel was looking  sell a steel plant in Ukraine His Midland Resources Holding Ltd which owned the Zaporizhstal steel facry sold at least half its stake  a collection of five offshore companies that received funding from VEB according  documents in the trove of files from the law firm Mossack Fonseca that were obtained  the International Consortium of Investigative JournalistsThe documents show that one year after acquiring the Zaporizhstal stake the five companies  based in Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands  transferred it  Russian controlIn each case the companies shares were charged in favor of VEB meaning the bank effectively ok ownership of them in exchange for financing the steel plant acquisitionNothing in the Panama Papers linked VEBs financing  the Trump project which Mr Trump did not own Rather the deal underscored VEBs strategy  venture in Ukraine at the behest of the Russian governmentMore broadly the banks plan had been  tap capital markets in New York  help finance the Ukraine lending but the plan collapsed with the imposition of sanctions in 2014The bank day not unlike Mr Putins government expanded its sway abroad in a way that appears unsustainable Weighed down  sanctions and the oil price collapse the Russian economy has slipped  12th in the world below South Koreas according  a World Bank rankingAt the time sanctions were imposed the banks tal debt ran about 20 billion It has since been reduced  17 billion according  financial disclosures at the end of last year But the Ukraine lending in particular is affecting the balance sheet with outstanding Ukraine debt taling 142 billion at the current exchange rate banking analysts sayLast week the Russian business newspaper Vedomosti reported that about 40 percent of VEBs loans were at risk of defaultMr rkov who previously worked at the Yukos oil company and was a senior executive at Sberbank became direcr of VEB in February 2016 partly with a mandate  find market solutions  the banks financial woesFor Mr rkov fixing VEB would require a new focus and that according  the banks statement became the reason for a meeting with Mr KushnerThe two met as Mr rkov traveled  gather ideas for a new strategy for the bank published a month after the meeting with Mr Kushner in a document called Strategy 2021 It called for shifting some risks directly  the Russian budget selling assets not considered central  the bank and trying  resume borrowing in places like the United StatesThe document suggested that the bank was expecting some relief from sanctions The forecasts for the term of the strategy predict certain decrease of geopolitical risks and gradual weakening of the restricted access  global capital markets it saidRobert Amsterdam a lawyer who has represented Mr rkovs former boss at Yukos Mikhail B Khodorkovsky said it was essential that sanctions be lifted for the VEB turnaround  succeedPutin doesnt have  worry about what the voters think of him Mr Amsterdam said Putin has  think about the p 100 And the p 100 are those who are sanctionedLong before VEB became saddled with sanctions it had deep ties  Washingn and Wall StreetIn 2010 Mr rkovs predecessor appeared at the US Chamber of Commerce in Washingn  unveil a pact with the ExportImport Bank of the United States the federal agency that supports American exports Under the deal the two institutions agreed  cooperate in financing US exports  RussiaThe arrangement was followed  two littlenoticed deals In 2013 the ExportImport Bank guaranteed a loan of about 500 million so that in effect a VEB subsidiary could acquire a number of Boeing 777 aircraft  planes that VEB then leased  Aeroflot Russian Airlines A year later shortly before the sanctions hit the American agency guaranteed another loan of about 700 million for a similar dealIn a statement a spokeswoman for the ExportImport Bank said These transactions all supported the sale of US exports and thus supported American jobsSince the sanctions ok effect the spokeswoman said there have been no new VEB transactions and deals involving any Russian entities have been placed on administrative holdThe sanctions also limited VEBs relationship with American banks The sanctions prohibit United States banks and companies from transacting in providing financing for or otherwise dealing in new longterm debtFor years issuing debt was a good business for both Wall Street and VEB Between 2006 and 2013 ldman Citi and Morgan Stanley helped the Russian bank issue one bond deal after another according  data from SP Global Market IntelligenceNow American banks can work for VEB only in more limited rolesJPMorgan Citi and BNY Mellon for example remain registered  clear VEBs transactions through the United States clearinghouse records show though such transactions have waned since the sanctions were imposed Many major American banks and investment firms also continue  include VEB debt in mutual funds including those of Fidelity and Pimco securities filings showIt would not be out of the ordinary then for a VEB official  have brief courtesy meetings with New York bankers about continuing business though they would not be allowed  discuss new bond deals said Aaron Wolfson a partner at Lewis Baach who previously worked at JPMorgan and prosecuted banks for skirting sanctionsStill Zachary K ldman a former Treasury Department official who worked on financial sanctions issues said the banks needed  be cautiousMr rkov 48 graduated in 1994 from the university of the Federal Security Service the successor  the KGB  a school for spies Like many in his generation of security agents in the early postSoviet period he ventured in banking and the oil businessIn fact say businessmen who have worked in Russia so many FSB agents are in the upper management of stateowned companies that the roles of spy and executive blend almost seamlesslyIn Putins Russia they dont draw a distinction said Mr Amsterdam the lawyer who represented Mr rkovs former employerHighly educated and often speaking foreign languages former FSB officers include Mr Putin himself senior officials throughout his government and board members and p executives at staterun corporationsMr rkovs biography on VEBs website does not suggest he ever served in the FSB The bank did not respond  questions about whether he worked for the agencyBut the bank has been known  employ spies In 2015 federal prosecurs in Manhattan and Washingn announced charges against Evgeny Buryakov an employee at VEBs New York office accusing him of acting as a covert agent of the SVR the Russian foreign intelligence agencyAt the time the authorities suspected that some VEB managers were aware of Mr Buryakovs spy activities according  a person briefed on the investigation Federal authorities recorded a conversation between the two codefendants discussing how an SVR official ld Mr Buryakovs supervisor at VEB that Mr Buryakov was an employee of the serviceReporting was contributed  Michael Corkery Steve Eder Chrispher Drew Kitty

President Trump made the international oil cartel his latest bte noire One potential reason It makes life more difficult for many Americans weighing on the benefits of the Republican tax cutsThe context OPEC and Russia agreed two years ago  cut  and maintain  oil production caps  bring prices back up in the wake of US shale boom So far that strategy has workedWith oil above 73 now even after Mr Trumps tweet fuel prices are at reaching twoyear highs as the US gets in the summer driving season More importantly Americans are preparing  spend more on fuel eating in whatever savings they are expected  receive on average from the tax cutsAmericans are expected  spend an average of 400 per household more on fuel this year than in 2016 as the rebound in crude prices is reflected in the cost

Fargo can do or how much more it can spend  make amendsThats the contention of the reporter Jonathan Greenberg who as a Forbes reporter in 1984 spoke with John Barron about Donald Trumps net worth Mr

When people behave as if they have something  hide it is often because they do For me this is a basic law of human behaviorThats why President Trumps baffling outrageous unfathomable and just plain bizarre behavior last week strengthened my already strong suspicions that there is something that Trump knows about the investigations in his campaigns contacts with Russia that he doesnt want us  knowThat is the only way that I can make sense of what happened These are either the machinations of concealment expressions of a burgeoning insanity or bothThe details of the most recent episode in the Trump madness are now well known and yet every new detail that helps add texture  the sry also renders it more horrifyingly egregiousWho does thatLegal and ethical questions abound about the impropriety and even legality of attempting  strongarm and then dismissing and threatening the law enforcement official leading an investigation in your circle of associatesMany of those questions rise not from clandestine sources but rather from Trump himself He is talking and tweeting himself in legal jeopardy He cant seem  help himself Something in the man is brokenHe is insecure paranoid and brittle jostling between egomania and narcissism inxicated with a power beyond his meager comprehension and indulging in it beyond the point of abuseSome people are ebulliently optimistic that the abomination is coming undone and may soon be at an endBut I would caution that this is a moment pregnant with calamityThe man we see unraveling before our eyes still retains the power of the presidency until such time as he doesnt and that time of termination is  no means assuredTrump is now a wounded animal desperate and dangerous Survival is an overwhelming instinctual impulse and one should put nothing beyond a being who is bent on ensuring itBanking on an easy impeachment or resignation or a shiny set of handcuffs is incredibly tempting for those drained and depressed  Trumps unabated absurdities perversions of truth and facts and assaults on cusm normalcy and civilityBut banking on this is at this point premature I share the yearning A case for removal can most definitely be made and has merit But there remain unld steps between plausibility and probability Expectations must be managed so that hopes arent dashed if the mark isnt immediately metThere are incredibly encouraging signs that the Comey debacle has crystallized sentiment about the severity of Trumps abnormality and the urgent need for an independent investigation in the Russia connectionAs the chief law enforcement officers of our respective states we view the Presidents firing of FBI Direcr James Comey in the middle of his investigation of Russian interference in the presidential election as a violation of the public trust As prosecurs committed  the rule of law we urge you  consider the damage  our democratic system of any attempts  the administration  derail and delegitimize the investigationThe report continued Critical are big losses among white voters with no college degree white men and independent votersThe army of righteous truthseekers is gathering the hordes of sycophants are faltering The challenge now is  keep the medias microscope trained on this issue and  keep applying sufficient pressure  elected officialsWe may have reached an inflection point at which even partisans grow weary of the barrage of lies and the indefensible behavior and Republican representatives finally realize that they are constitutional officers who must defend the country even if it damages their partySomething is happening Its in the air It is an awakening it is an adjustment it is a growing upCollapse,banking
The Isle of Youth  which has been both a Communist Upian getaway and home  a brutal prison that housed Castro for a time  is a world apart even  Cuban standardsSupported Theres nothing like a tal absence of safety measures  add a little excitement  a hisrical site Within an hour of landing on La Isla de la Juventud the Isle of Youth I was clambering through an underground tunnel in the Presidio Modelo or Model Prison Cubas most dreaded prerevolutionary prison using my iPhone as a rch and trying not  slip on wooden planks and rubble After squeezing up a rusty spiral staircase I emerged ap a wer at the center of an enormous circular cell building that resembled a tropical Colosseum where a single guard would once monir more than 1000 prisoners at a timeThe scale was bewildering  it was one of four 1931 jail structures in the Model Prison rising like sinister missile silos with a mess hall at their center Just as bewildering the fact that nobody would sp me climbing five sries without handrails in cells with a 50foot drop on concrete One can only marvel at Cuban liability laws or the lack thereof The whiff of danger helped bring the disturbing past of the Presidio which functioned from the late 1920s  1967  vivid life A small museum was filled with startling phos of the prisons brutal inner life when it was run  wild convict gangs with weapons crafted from iron spikes and nails But the most striking sight of all came when I entered the former hospital ward which in the 1950s was reserved for political prisoners Posted on a wall was a mug shot of its most norious inmate Fidel Castro  without a beardThe Presidio was closed a few years after Castros vicry in 1959 and is now maintained as a shrine  the revolutions early struggle with phos of each prisoner over his bed Its a tribute  the resilience of the young rebels who  whatever their later faults once they ok power  ok on the brutal Batista dictarship at great personal risk The aura of idealism becomes particularly poignant day as Cubas revolutionary dream has become as battered as the corrugated iron ceiling of the Presidio itself  its gaping views of the sky letting in the beating sun the tropical rain and chirping green parrotsStill its an uphill battle  attract travelers since La Isla is day so obscure that even most Cubans know nothing about it I had only the haziest idea of what I might find there when I turned up at the Havana airport before dawn  catch a propeller plane A halfhour later we were banking over the commashaped island and landing at its only wn Nueva Gerona I was relieved  find that La Isla had lost none of its oddity We were met at the tiny airport  a nurse in white uniform who screened us all for feversWhile its no longer true  say that Havana is stuck in the 1950s an argument can be made for La Isla  perhaps the 1850s There are no streetlights in Nueva Gerona no buildings taller than two sries and almost the only traffic is horseandbuggy On its sleepy pedestrian boulevard the main cultural attraction is a map of Cuba made from rusty horseshoes At dusk teenagers make out in the Park of the Heroic Guerrilla while older couples promenade arm in arm and take romantic carriage rides holding hands After dark everyone converges on the boulevard  hear live salsa and dance the only concession  the 21st century being a decent sound systemI checked in a casa particular a private guesthouse a cozy home decorated with ceramic fish and boasting a sunny billiards room It was run  a voluble woman named Diami who whipped up fortifying breakfasts of sweet black coffee farm eggs and chunks of mango the most succulent of the tropical fruits that grow like weeds on the fertile island We call these American mangoes because they are plump and red she deadpanned The islanders spoke with cheery resignation about being forgotten  the world We suffer from double insularity a wiry chainsmoking poet named Tony Ramrez said excitedly when I met him at one of the few restaurants El Galen which as its name suggests was shaped like a galleon We feel very far from the rest of Cuba which is already cut off from the world Tony drew inspiration for his writing from being in un mundo aparte a world apart he said but worried about the islands vulnerability Communications are a problem One puff of wind let alone a cyclone and were on our ownOn this island of broken dreams the ruins of the revolutionary schools of the 1980s litter the landscape like giant Lego blocks Castro traveled here  personally inaugurate the idealistic education program in 1978 and change the name of the Isle of Pines  Isle of Youth  which has a Communist Upian ring but also evokes the mad quest of Ponce de Len for the Fountain of Youth Confusingly islanders are still called Pineros in Cuba Within a decade there were 61 schools on the island serving 35000 students mostly from Africa After the Soviet Union crumbled funding was cut and the students vanished as if they had never been here A 2008 hurricane did the rest  gutting the schoolsAlthough most of the Sovietstyle structures are in poetic decay three still function for locals We called in at Escuela No 8 the Clara Zetkin School named after a German Marxist theorist and now filled with island children The walls are still decorated with a Cold War mural the Cuban version of if you see something say something A giant eye hovers over a map of the island with an illustrated list of dangers that pupils should report including enemy aircraft enemy parachutists and dead animalsWhen Congress reluctantly gave La Isla back  Cuba in 1924 most settlers left in disappointment but those who stayed are buried in the American Cemetery I strolled with the bemused taxista Ray through the lonely field in golden light reading names from overgrown gravesnes  one shaped like a tree trunk  and pausing at a gazebo until the mosquies drove us outAs fearful as we are of thousands of Americans going down  Cuba and recreating the mass urism model that destroyed much of the Caribbean he ld me in Nueva Gerona urism has  be part of the solution Because it is researchbased the Red Alerta program has been unaffected  recent changes  travel for American citizens but visits have  be arranged through an authorized travel agency or Ocean DocrSoon we were moring south with a dive master and a cook Our first mission was  snorkel off a popular beach called Pun Francs where two years ago Dr Guggenheim had seen intact expanses of elkhorn coral a barometer of reef health Even an amateur like me could tell that all was not well below the waves That is a wonderful example of a reef that is 90 percent dead Dr Guggenheim said with a sigh as we dried off back on board There had been some bleaching from climate change he explained but the main culprit was overfishing which led  the coral being slowly covered in slimy green algae We treat fish like crops  be harvested he said but they have important jobs  do in the ecosystem One of them is grazing on algae which keeps reefs cleanThings improved radically when we dove  a remote site named El Reino de la Sahara the King of the Sahara Rays of sunlight burst down on reefs that were surging with life like underwater cities including brilliantly colored sea fans and flamingo ngues A moray eel patrolled the shallows and there were expanses of thriving elkhorn coral That reef was 90 percent healthy or better Dr Guggenheim rejoiced But Cuba is in the balance It could go either way The good thing is that it has the legal protection he added noting that 25 percent of Cubas waters are protected  a higher percentage than the United States he said Castro promoted marine protection after he met Jacques Cousteau in the 1980s and became an avid scuba diver But it doesnt have enforcementThe air of melancholy left  so many vanished dreams was present even when I decided  climb a remote mountain known as La Loma on my final morning  get a glimpse of the islands hardvisit south To get there I went  meet a farmerturnedguide Arcadio Castro no relation who wore a tattered Tshirt and lived in a marblefloor shack

cinnamondusted guinea fried hen with piripiri rice on the side he saidMr Smalls who remains an owner but had no hand in the new steakhouse menu disagreed blaming poor management and a business plan that he said failed  adequately adjust when a planned lunchtime seating never materializedAs the owners tinkered  find the right formula the restaurants closed then reopened Caught in the middle was Mr Johnson who started out as chef de cuisine of the Cecil and ended up as executive chef of both restaurants The job though came with little aunomyMr Johnson 33 said he needed  lay a foundation for himself his wife Samiyyah Chapman and their 3monthold twins He ld his bosses he wanted a bigger role and more restaurantsWhen they said  me they really didnt want  do anything else I had  go look in the mirror and say Would I be content here working for the next 10 years he said At that point I dont mean  sound cocky but Im just better than that He resigned in JuneMr Johnson has forged ahead alone in other ventures He was trying  persuade Stephane De Baets a founder and the president of Chefs Club  invest in Ingrained Hospitality when another idea came  Mr De Baets Why dont you come do a popup  show me first your cuisine Mr De Baets recalled asking himThat success led  the longer stay at Chefs Club a cavernous space with an open kitchen where diners can watch the chefs in actionMr Johnson has filled the menu with brightly colored dishes and flavors seen most obviously in a shared plate of cornmealcrusted sea bass seasoned with turmeric that takes up an entire bowl and leaves just enough room for purple sweet potaes roasted carrots papaya and long beansA few dishes like udon noodles with braised goat and piripiri prawns have followed Mr Johnson  Chefs Club from the Cecil His favorite dessert is a rice milk pop of raspberry and hibiscus with crispy puffed rice drizzled on pAt Chefs Club Mr Johnson also did something he could never do at the Cecil He put his name on it placing the neon letters JJ in the window He also required the restaurant  play his dayslong soundtrack which he commissioned a DJ  compile On a recent night several diners bobbed their heads and swayed in their seatsMusic plays as much of a role in dining as food Mr Johnson said recalling how his Puer Rican grandmother played salsa while she prepared sofri and plantain dumplings and how his black American grandmother raised in the Rocky Mountains played Stevie Wonder Michael Jackson and Earth Wind  Fire as she made cherry pies and traditional Southern foodHis taste runs  90s neosoul and hiphop Thats part of the diaspora he said Thats when I feel like black artists were having the best times in their careers They were able  really put their music out Like Biggie Tupac WuTang Mariah Erykah Badu they were talking about real stuff that was happening in our livesFor 360 a diner can have everything on the menu in a tasting that Mr Johnson calls It Was All a Dream a nod  The Norious BIGs JuicyThis is a dream for me he said I get  the cook the food of who I am and listen  the music that I want  listen Mr Johnson said he also wants  create jobs and hire people who look like him His giveback attitude appears  come from his parents Marcela Johnson a retired teacher and Joe Johnson a bookkeeper who still runs a youth basketball program in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania where they raised their son and his younger sister The family traveled on vacation  Barbados Puer Rico Jamaica and North Carolina  trips that in reflection helped him see the African diaspora firsthandThough Mr Johnson excelled in a variety of sports including skiing basketball and soccer he wanted  be a chef His mother insisted that despite the expense he study at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park NY After graduating he worked in New York at Tribeca Grill and the Smith then as a personal chef and later in an executive dining room at Morgan StanleyIn 2011 as a contestant on Roccos Dinner Party a Bravo reality TV show hosted  the chef Rocco DiSpiri Mr Johnson wooed the judges with a dish of smothered shrimp and gritsThe meal caught the eye of Mr Smalls a South Carolina native who said Mr Johnson reminded him of his father who would prepare the same Lowcountry dish for special occasions Mr Smalls reached out  Mr Johnson and they developed a teacherapprentice relationship Mr Johnson accompanied Mr Smalls on educational trip  Ghana and that led  the job at the CecilSaying the food was amazing Mr Ozersky ld Mr Smalls Its a shame you wont get credit for itMr Smalls remembered pushing back Its not important that Im the person thats cooking the food and most remembered for it Its important that its remembered he said If I did something right in selecting a protg who is going  make that a platform then I aint madCollapse,banking

WASHINGTON  President Trump is expected  nominate Jerome H Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve replacing Janet L Yellen whose term expires early next year according  two people familiar with the plansBoth people familiar with the presidents thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity cautioned that Mr Trump was noriously mercurial and liked creating drama around important personnel decisions However both said the president appeared set on Mr Powell An announcement could come as soon as Thursday after the Fed wraps up a twoday policy meeting on Wednesday and before Mr Trump leaves on Friday for a 12day Asia tripIn looking past Ms Yellen Mr Trump would be breaking with longstanding precedent Every Fed chairman in modern hisry who completed a first fouryear term was nominated for a second The last three Fed chairmen were nominated for new terms  a president of the opposite party And Mr Trump has praised Ms Yellens performance During her four years unemployment has fallen sharply inflation has remained low and the economy is growingYou like  make your own mark Mr Trump said last week  way of explanationIn choosing Mr Powell however Mr Trump would be resisting pressure  conservatives  make a larger mark on the Feds management of the economy Many conservatives including Vice President Mike Pence favored the selection of John B Taylor a Stanford economist who has been an outspoken critic of the Feds monetary policyMr Powell  contrast has voted for every Fed policy decision since 2012 although he expressed some reservations in internal debates about the extent of those efforts In recent years he has backed the methodical unwinding of the Feds stimulus campaign which involved purchasing 4 trillion worth of Treasuries and mortgagebacked securities  help the economy recover from the 2008 financial crisisFed officials are often labeled hawks if they favor higher interest rates  control inflation or doves if they want  keep rates low  promote job growth Richard Fisher a former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas who worked with Mr Powell at the Fed said Mr Powell is neither a hawk nor a doveI used  say that we all want  be wise owls he added and I think that he fits that category very wellMr Fisher said Mr Powell was moderate  a fault Ive tried  get him  drink more than two glasses of wine at dinner and he will not do it he saidA survey of 144 invesrs conducted  Evercore ISI found that they expected that Mr Powell would push rates modestly higher than Ms Yellen over timeDescribing an effort already underway at the Fed he said The whole idea is  preserve the significant core reforms that were made but  go back and clean up our workMr Powell would require Senate confirmation and his views particularly on regulation could draw opposition from some conservatives in the Senate 21 of whom voted against his confirmation as a Fed governor in 2014 Two Republicans on the Senate banking committee which will consider the nomination had previously raised concerns about Mr Powell Senar Tim Scott of South Carolina and Senar Patrick J Toomey of PennsylvaniaIf nominated and confirmed Mr Powell would be the first Fed chair in four decades without an economics degree He brings a background in financial markets a contrast with Ms Yellen and her predecessor Ben S Bernanke People who have worked with Mr Powell say he studied economics assiduously after joining the Fed gathering stacks of papers on the questions of the day then reading and discussing the findings with colleaguesI think its far more important  understand and appreciate highquality economic analysis than it is  have a PhD said Kim Schoenholtz a professor of economics at New York UniversityHe noted that most Treasury secretaries had not held degrees in economics What distinguishes the most effective secretaries is skill at bringing in talented personnel and appreciation for the value of informed economic analyses he saidJon Faust a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University who worked with Mr Powell at the Fed said Mr Powell had endeavored  understand monetary policy and had demonstrated a strong grasp of the subject But Mr Faust said it might be particularly important  have a trained economist as chairman if there was another recessionIf the economy broadly behaves I dont think itll be of great consequence Mr Faust said If we were  face another period where you need innovative and creative leadership Jay has a lot of skills and it could still go OK but youd like  add  those skills a lifetime of studying monetary policyMr Powell 64 is a Washingn native who has spent most of his life in a mix of public and private roles He studied politics at Princen University then earned a law degree from Georgewn University before embarking on a career in investment banking in New YorkIn 1990 he returned  Washingn  work for his former boss Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady as under secretary for finance When Salomon Brothers was caught manipulating the market in Treasuries Mr Powell vacationing on Cape Cod spent a long August weekend on the phone arranging for p managers  resign and for Warren E Buffett  be chairman of the companys boardMr Powell joined the private equity firm Carlyle Group in 1997 and earned a fortune His most recent financial disclosure showed a net worth of as much as 55 million In 2005 he left the firm  focus on fiscal policy as a scholar at the Bipartisan Policy CenterHe attracted the attention of the Obama administration in 2011 for his work behind the scenes  persuade congressional Republicans  raise the debt ceiling The next year President Barack Obama nominated Mr Powell  the Fed alongside a Democrat the Harvard economist Jeremy Stein in a package deal that was meant  attract bipartisan supportMr Stein returned  his life as a Harvard professor after two years Mr Powell decided he liked working at the Fed and so he stayedCollapse,banking

policies are on the way Heres a look at some reactionsJoe Brusuelas the chief economist at RSM US wroteThe resignation of Gary Cohen from his position at the White House will likely have no  little impact on policymaking out of the West Wing or the bureaucracy His likely replacement be it Peter Navarro or Larry Kudlow will still be subject  the whims of the occupant of the oval office and a prisoner of the internal inconsistencies of the Trump economic agenda that it could debt finance a 15 trillion dollar tax cut with a 750 billion fudge facr and then throw an additional 320 billion in kerosene on p of the debt fueled flames without sking rising inflation and higher interest rates that are almost certain  follow in its wake No economic advisor whatever their academic or professional background will be able  liberate the economy from such internal inconsistencies given the whim like policy making apparatus that exists inside a chaotic White HouseBrian Gardner and Michael Michaud analysts at Keefe Bruyette  Woods wroteRegardless of whether Mr Cohns replacement comes from the mainstream or is an economic nationalist invesrs need  realize that President Trumps populist rheric on trade is real and that protectionist trade policies are more likely than not To date invesrs have been assuaged that Mr Cohn was the adult in the room in an unorthodox and chaotic White House and for most economic and regulary policy that was the case However we think trade policy is different and invesrs need  understand that the assumptions about a liberal and open global trade framework are being shredded and that the sanctions on steel and aluminum may represent a new paradigm regarding global tradeWhat does that mean The analysts said they think the United States is more likely than

OpEd ContriburLONDON  Coming clean about how much you earn is like confessing  adultery Its probably the right thing  do but therell be hell  pay afterward In the case of the salaries of the BBCs p earners the fallout is likely  be messier on account of its being the BBC that did the fessing up on its talents behalf We all know what happens when someone else admits your adultery for youThe BBC was never it must be said a willing party  this It was the governments idea The BBC buzzes in the governments brain All that money coming in and no accountability No deference either If you want your license renewed for another decade the government insisted  the BBC you will have  tell us who among your starriest talent is earning more than 150000 pounds about 195000 per annumWhy that apparently arbitrary amount Its what the prime minister earnsRight now the country wouldnt object  anyone earning more than Theresa May but at the time the government made this demand the position of prime minister was held in slightly higher esteem Leaving Mrs May out of it the first responses  the BBCs disclosures have held steady somewhere between intemperate rage and apoplexy encompassing contempt for the government for forcing the BBCs hand disgust with the BBC over the size of the remunerations revealed and fury all around at their inequalityThe inevitable ad hominem queries why does A earn less than B but more than C have yielded  the larger ad feminem question of why across the board women are paid significantly less than men  in some cases hundreds of thousands of pounds less  for doing the same jobTheres been no definitive answer  that yet not least as the entire structure of stars pay is built on quicksand Whos  say what a fair salary is for a newsreader or a sports presenter of either sex How do we measure the worth of talent And  what scale in a company funded  taxpayers is perceived value at any level of performance  be rewardedIt was argued before that divulging what the highest paid receive would lead  an explosion in wage demands and it is widely supposed now that it will If this exercise was intended  make the BBC more accountable and hold down costs the opposite is likely  be the caseNo one likes  know that someone doing the same job is paid more and of those who are paid more few are likely  welcome the idea of being paid less The trend can be only for all those lower down  ask for a raise and for the BBC  pay it Otherwise and this is the argument used  free marketeers the world over they will go elsewhere  an assumption rooted in what they call realism and what we might call cynicismSo should the exercise never have been attempted If other peoples salaries are a minefield arent we safer not venturing out thereThe trouble is that when we do find out the details they demoralize us still more Theres inequity and theres inequity That we are living through a time of political turmoil is in no small part because of what we learned after the banking crisis of 2008 The rich beggar all our imaginings both in what they earn and own and in what they consider their unique entitlement  go on earning and owning more You dont need  be a Marxist  see that a distribution of wealth as grossly unfair as ours alienates the poor and disheartens even the moderately welldoToo great a disparity makes a mockery of all human endeavor other than accumulation And in the end makes fools of the accumulars oSoccer anyway obeys its own rules Miss a penalty for Manchester United and you still pocket a quarter of a million pounds Fans seem not  mind this as much as they would for a banker who misses his targets and still gets his bonus To those who play with balls everything is forgiven And as with the players so with the commentars We indulge them as we indulge spoiled childrenA similar refusal  sit in judgment holds us back from questioning what a radio host earns provided that his show belongs  the lightest category of light entertainment Spin a disc or rather cue up a track and youre unuchable The BBC has revealed that its highest earner is Chris Evans who hosts a popular morning radio show He is not  everybodys taste but he is personable fast on the trigger and pulls in a huge audienceWhy not in that case a huge fee Mr Evans earns 225 million nearly 3 million Is that o much How  measure And even if we suspect it is a trifle high we dont want  say so Light entertainment like sport enjoys a strange exemption from any form of denigrationPeople mutht be amuthed Thquire as the lisping owner of a circus says in Charles Dickenss Hard Times Dickens wrote passionately about the important part entertainment plays in cheering up a depressed nation Being a novelist for him didnt preclude being an entertainer Whether or not we expect more of a novelist day and less of an entertainer we o attach a high value  amusement and dont begrudge the fantastical salaries paid  those who help us while away the hoursEven were we  feel differently a fear of appearing elitist would make us hold our ngues Woe betide those in our Hard Times who show contempt for what is popularArguably the middle range of high earners  the newsreaders interviewers opinion formers and the like  have attracted a disproportionate amount of adverse comment from the public which puts a lower estimation on words than personality These salaries are certainly hard  justify but at least in this the BBC is remembering its commitment  conscientious current affairs journalismAs for the men and women at the more philosophical end of broadcasting few figure in the list This isnt  say there isnt still intellectually ambitious radio and lets not forget that there remains an entire station devoted  classical music but these presenters are distinctly poor relations BBC television is worse still  pennypinching the life out of arts programming and rarely finding the will or the cash  commission anything that might remotely be thought of as difficultIt used  be taken for granted that the BBC whether it led the culture or followed it would be comprehensive in its ambitions Part of its public service remit was  educate as well as entertain  aim high as well as low Now well there isnt the funding  cater for the fastidious Ask why that is and the answer isnt hard  find The cash has been blown on trifles light as airHeres the greatest iniquity uncovered  the BBCs disclosures While dodging questions of discrimination and taste the BBCs management has shown  what standards of trivia it measures Starstruck in the extreme it is hypnotized  celebrity Given all that was once asked of our public broadcaster and all that it once promised that is nothing short of infidelityThe adulterers defense rarely wavers It meant

listening posts  online sites where people could send their ideas and concerns and receive actual replies rather than form letters They could also conduct wn hallstyle meetings where representatives

facesPostBrexit Britains banks and financial firms would lose special rights that allow them  operate in any EU country with few restrictions Britain could fall back on an arrangement that would allow British banks  do business in the EU if they operated under regulations that were equivalent  those in the bloc But this arrangement has drawbacks It does not cover important types of financial activities and British banks may have  comply with any changes  regulation that the EU introducesHence the new planThe scheme that Britain may now propose appears designed  address those problems It would allow both sides leeway  strike their own rules once theyve agreed on their main objectives And it suggests that a moniring regime and mechanism for resolving disputes be set upWill the EU agree  the planThe bloc may reject such a proposal because it would risk losing some control over financial regulation Certain politicians in the EU may argue Britain is trying  retain the privileges of the single market while discarding the duties that come with it Still some of Europes leaders banks and businesses may support the plan in the belief that it will minimize disruption and allow the City of

News AnalysisWASHINGTON  In a fiery speech  supporters on Friday President Trump went after his vanquished opponent from 2016 We had a crooked candidate he declared The crowd responded with a signature chant from the campaign trail Lock her upMr Trump is correct that nothing produced publicly  Mr Mueller  date has claimed any wrongdoing  the president nor any illegal collaboration with the Russians seeking  influence the 2016 election The indictment of the Russians  who are accused of flooding Facebook and other social media with disinformation and propaganda  cited only contact with unwitting individuals connected with Mr Trumps campaignJohn M Dowd the presidents private lawyer pointed  Mr Trumps cooperation with the investigation as evidence that he had nothing  hide He noted that the White House had voluntarily turned over more than 20000 pages  Mr Mueller including documents related  Mr Flynn and Mr Comey and the campaign provided 14 million pagesMore than 20 White House officials including eight members of the counsels office voluntarily gave interviews  the special counsel or congressional investigars as did 17 campaign employees and 11 others affiliated with the campaign he addedI give great credit  the president for his extraordinary cooperation with the special counsel Mr Dowd saidStill as the pileup at the courthouse indicates allies of Mr Trump acknowledged that the investigation had taken a llThe good news for the White House is that more than 18 months since the FBI probe began there is still no evidence of Russian collusion said Chrispher Ruddy the chief executive of Newsmax and a friend of Mr Trump The bad news is that the special counsel has a scorchedearth prosecution aimed at crushing the presidents associatesI dont think the president is worried about the investigation himself he added but it clearly bothers him that people are being prosecuted simply because they worked for his campaignInside the White House officials expressed calm resignation on Friday as Mr Gates marched in the courthouse But there was lowgrade concern out of recognition that Mr Gates was in a lot of meetings over a long period of timeWhile Mr Gates joined the campaign with Mr Manafort his longtime business partner and menr he stayed after Mr Manafort was fired He rode on Mr Trumps campaign plane and served as liaison  the Republican National Committee After the election vicry he joined the transition as a right hand  Thomas J Barrack Jr the presidents close friend who ran the inaugural operationThe fact that Mr Gates was allowed  plead guilty  just two relatively lowerlevel charges indicated  legal experts that he must have something of value for Mr Mueller The presumption in Mr Trumps circle is that Mr Gates may not have any incriminating information about the president but could be a dangerous witness against Mr Manafort who in turn could threaten Mr TrumpMr Trumps argument that none of this has anything  do with him resonates with many of his supporters who have echoed his repeated insistence that there was no collusion with Russia But being surrounded  people who are prosecuted has damaged other presidents even when they were not directly implicatedIn the current case the targets so far have included not just a coffee boy as Mr Papadopoulos was described  an adviser  Mr Trump but the presidents p two campaign officials and national security adviser While Mr Trump has dismissed the relevance of allegations against Mr Manafort because they involved business dealings before the campaign the latest indictment claims that he was scheming  defraud banks while serving as Mr Trumps chairmanMoreover it remains unclear why he volunteered  work for Mr Trumps campaign without pay at a time when he was experiencing significant financial pressureMr Trumps defenders have focused on questioning the original basis for the investigation accusing the FBI of misconduct in relying on an unverified dossier assembled  a former British spy hired  investigars working for Mrs Clinns campaignTo the extent that Mr Mueller is exploring whether Mr Trump obstructed justice  firing Mr Comey the presidents defenders contend that under the Constitution he has the power  dismiss executive branch officials and dictate their work They also point  testimony  Mr Comey and other officials who said the investigation was not impededTherefore they argue the original order appointing Mr Mueller was itself invalid and should be revokedIt doesnt make sense  unfold piecemeal an indictment of Russian entities and Russians if you have any hope of building a collusion case It makes no logical sense he said To me at least what hes done does underscore that theres no collusion there That leaves him with the obstruction of justice narrative which I think is constitutionally flawed and isnt going  go anywhereMr Wittes said Mr Muellers actions could be seen as building a pyramid  establishing that there was a Russian influence campaign and assembling a group of cooperating witnesses But the special counsel has not tipped his hand yetThe basic conurs of the puzzle is that hes constructed his actions in a way that we dont know where its leading he said and thats on purposeMaggie Haberman contributed reporting from New YorkFollow Peter Baker on Twitter peterbakernytCollapse,banking

TEHRAN  The United States on Wednesday removed a final hurdle for Western aircraft manufacturers  sell planes  Iran a country desperately in need of hundreds of new aircraftA spokesman for Boeing said the license covered the sale of 80 planes  Irans national carrier Iran Air Airbus confirmed that it received a license for an initial sale of 17 planes part of a larger deal that involves a tal of 118 planesThe green light for aircraft sales allows Iran a country of 80 million  start rebuilding its aging fleet of Boeing and Airbus planes and other secondhand aircraft purchased clandestinely from other countries Over the past four decades hundreds of Iranians have died in crashes caused  malfunctioning or poorly maintained aircraftUnder that deal Iran has given up parts of its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief Since then the country has managed  increase its oil sales but it has not been able  sign major deals with Western companies because of continuing banking restrictions related  nonnuclear sanctionsWhile the United States has relaxed many of its sanctions against Iran Washingn still demands that even nonAmerican manufacturers wishing  sell  Iran obtain an export license if their products include materials made in the United States Airbus based in Europe buys more than 40 percent of all its aircraft parts in the United StatesThe granting of the licenses is likely  draw protests from some members of Congress who have noted that Iranian commercial aircraft have been used  transport troops and weapons in Syria Representative Peter Roskam Republican of Illinois said in a statement that the Obama administration has once again made a political decision  appease Iran at the expense of our national security He said Congress was committed  making the process of delivering the planes as difficult and expensive as possibleWestern political analysts who specialize in Iran said the Treasurys decision reflected an effort  the Obama administration  help Mr Rouhani who staked much of his political reputation on promised economic dividends from the termination of nuclear sanctionsThe US is interested in constructive engagement with Iran despite continuing turmoil in the bilateral relationship said Cliff Kupchan the chairman of the Eurasia Group a Washingnbased political consultancy He called the license approvals a big win for President Rouhani who needs  show Iranians that the nuclear deal is bringing concrete improvements  their livesIran had called for a meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly with representatives of the world powers that signed the nuclear agreement  Russia China Germany France Britain and the United States   complain about the lack of progress in carrying out the terms of the dealThis is very good news for President Rouhani said Nader Karimi Joni an analyst who supports the government He needed this news back home Bringing Airbus will fend off critics and make him popularSome in Iran however objected  what they said was political maneuvering in the timing of the Treasury Departments decision  grant the licensesThis is a bribe  the Americans  increase the chances of President Rouhani  be reelected said Hamidreza Taraghi a conservative analyst and political figure The American president in his last months in the White House wants  give as much support as possible  Rouhanis government and his proWestern factionMr Rouhani is scheduled  address the General Assembly on ThursdayAccording  the Treasury Department the licenses contain strict conditions  ensure that the planes will be used exclusively for commercial passenger use and cannot be resold or transferred  another entityA Boeing spokesman said the company was hoping  sell 46 singleaisle 737s 30 widebody 777s and four 747sIt remains unclear how Iran is planning  pay for the aircraft After years of sanctions and low oil prices the states coffers are empty International credit continues  be virtually unavailable with large banks shying away from dealing with Iran because of complicated regulations and continuing unilateral American sanctions against the country designated a state sponsor of terrorism  the United StatesThis is a moment for happiness said the pilot Houshang Shahbazi This is good for people This is wonderful Basically it means safer air travel for Iranian passengersThe landing captured on video became a symbol of the consequences of nearly four decades of American sanctions against Irans airline industry As a result of the sanctions Iran was left with a ragtag fleet of old planes bought during the era of the proWestern government in Iran and secondhand workhorses purchased from countries like UkraineThe 17 new Airbus planes are only a first step Captain Shahbazi

The next phase in the development of virtual currencies like Bitcoin was highlighted at a hearing last week conducted  Benjamin M Lawsky New York States p banking regular The question is not whether there will be greater regulation of firms developing new methods of transmitting payments with nongovernment currencies but how much regulation they will faceThe only ones not subject  the Bank Secrecy Act are users of virtual currencies who only buy and sell goods and services FinCen exempted their transactions which means individuals and merchants who use Bitcoin like cash do not need  comply with the regulations imposed on those operating exchangesIf that were the extent of government regulation there would be little concern about the negative effect of new rules on the development of virtual currencies No one supports creating an anonymous bazaar for dealing in drugs and other illegal goods and services  except perhaps the criminals themselvesThe more difficult issue is whether the government will reach further and try  impose more onerous rules on the exchanges and users of virtual currenciesIt might be helpful  consider what underpins any form of currency Putting it simply there are two aspects  currency the medium  which it is exchanged and the promise it incorporatesWhile regulars debate the pros and cons of bitcoins this volatile digital currency inspires the question What makes money moneyThe medium can be almost anything from paper notes and coins  gold and silver  electronic credits sred in a financial institution or central bank account When a government issues currency it comes with the promise that it is a legitimate means of transacting business in that country A dollar bill for instance states that it is legal tender for all debts public and privateBut virtual currencies raise concerns about how they can be transmitted and used for illegal purposes Testimony before Mr Lawsky  Richard B Zabel the deputy United States atrney in Manhattan highlighted the challenge facing law enforcement with the ease of movement that a medium like Bitcoin can provideTransferring 1 million in cash  buy drugs in another country would be difficult because of the sheer bulk of that much money and would probably get the attention of banking officials Using the equivalent in Bitcoin however only involves a few keystrokes So a virtual currency would be much more attractive than cash  those engaging in global illegal transactionsThe regulations in place for virtual currency exchanges may not be enough  satisfy law enforcements desire  keep criminals from creating a new avenue for transferring value across borders If someone was able  gather up enough Bitcoin while avoiding scrutiny from virtual currency exchanges then the transactions could fly beneath the regulary reporting rulesRegulars are also concerned that exchanges based in foreign countries might not impose the same cusmer disclosure requirements as the United States If someone can use a foreign exchange  conduct business outside the American governments watchful gaze then criminals could find ways  slip between the cracks and avoid scrutinyIt would not be a surprise if one ol would require those who control or trade over a certain threshold amount of a virtual currency  report their holdings  the government This approach is much like the rules requiring the owner of 5 percent of the shares of a publicly traded company  disclose any transactions  the Securities and Exchange CommissionOne promise supporting government currencies is that they have a certain value A central bank work tirelessly  maintain a target level for its currency in relation  other currencies which explains why the fear of inflation is so greatVirtual currencies do not carry the same promise So they depend on the market  determine their value which is often stated in relation  a traditional currency like the dollar or euro The government has no stake in how Bitcoin is valued but it is concerned that consumers be protected from abuses when they use a virtual currency  pay for goods and servicesTo protect consumers who want  use Bitcoin for legitimate transactions the government may adopt reporting requirements on virtual currency exchanges so that there is a public reposiry of information about prices Although the government cannot control the value of a virtual currency it can make the currency more transparent  users so that they are not defraudedMuch as the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulate sck and futures exchanges government regulars may require centralizing the trading in virtual currencies so that the market is less susceptible  manipulation That is a short step from treating firms that trade in virtual currencies like sck and commodities brokers which are subject  extensive disclosure and capital requirementsThe days of anonymous transactions in Bitcoin and operating an exchange with no outside interference are over As virtual currencies develop firms devoted  aiding trading and perhaps even their users will encounter greater government regulation along with the costs that come with compliance,banking
5 PhosJustin Mott for The New York TimesHANOI Vietnam  The Kitchen ds were asked  the emperors assistant What curves gentlyThe gods wore flowing robes fit for mandarins in a 17thcentury royal court But they were acrs in a television studio this weekFour potential answers flashed on the screen in the style of the game show Who Wants  Be a Millionaire One read A newly built roadNguyen Ba Tien a driving instrucr was watching the broadcast in his living room on Wednesday in Hanoi the Vietnamese capital He said the road answer was funny because it alluded  a widespread rumor that the path of a reallife Hanoi road had been altered in order  pass the homes of government officialsThe show called Meeting Each Other at Years End addresses hot pics in society Mr Tien said It reflects how Vietnamese people thinkIt really strikes a chord said Jonathan London a sociologist at the City University of Hong Kong who studies Vietnam This is a reminder that even the political cultures that exist within the state are varied and complex  and animated  diversity in a way that we shouldnt overlookIn real life the acrs portraying the Kitchen ds are part of Vietnams state apparatus and the zingers they utter are far less critical than the political dissent coursing through Vietnamese political blogs But unlike the blogs whose primary audience tends  be politically engaged intellectuals the show is hugely popular among ordinary Vietnamese especially in the northern part of the country who mainly follow current affairs through the filter of the statecontrolled news mediaIn a oneparty state where the ruling Communist Party exerts significant control over daily life and the economy  and stands accused  international advocacy groups of regularly jailing its domestic critics  some observers see the show as an informal bellwether of Vietnamese public opinionScholars say Vietnams traditional Kitchen ds represent a blend of Chinese and domestic folk traditions On Kitchen d Day the 23rd day of the last month of the lunar year the typical Vietnamese family burns three votive Kitchen d figurines at home and releases three fish  which also represent the gods  in a lake or river Those rituals are said  facilitate the gods trip  heaven where they issue reports  a celestial emperor about the familys behavior over the preceding 12 lunar monthsMeeting Each Other at Years End which first aired in 2003 is a creative interpretation of what happens when the Kitchen ds arrive in heaven Instead of reporting on an individual family they assess the state of the nation They are dressed like votive figurines but many Vietnamese consider them loose caricatures of government ministersThe gods often make clumsy excuses for the bribery and official mismanagement that pervade Vietnamese society One of the shows most popular refrains for example is the Song of the Envelope a sendup of the graft common in many Vietnamese public hospitalsThis years program ok subtle aim at the countrys slowburning banking crisis which analysts believe is linked  speculative property investments  stateowned enterprises and  poor oversight in the financial secr The joke began when a Kitchen d charged with reporting on earth reported that the property market had improved in 2014So does that mean bad debts have been reduced one of the emperors assistants askedBad debt Ask the Metal d the Earth d replied apparently passing the buck  the statedominated financial secrStill another prominent controversial pic in Vietnam last year the countrys standoff with China in the South China Sea was ignoredLe Van Lan hisry professor emeritus at Hanoi National University said the military and the Communist Party were never directly mocked on the show because that would be o politically sensitive But that is hardly surprising he noted in light of the official connections of Tran Binh Minh deputy direcr general of Vietnam TelevisionIn 2011 the Communist Partys online newspaper reported that Mr Minh was a member of the partys 175member Central Committee which included the current Vietnamese president Truong Tan Sang and the partys current secretary general Nguyen Phu TrongThats the big problem of this regime  everyones an official Professor Lan 80 said with a laughIndeed Vietnams statecontrolled news media has described tensions between the shows crears and government officials who bristle at its jokes Last year the Culture Ministry ordered the Communist Partys propaganda department  tightly supervise the show according  a report in the newspaper Thanh NienJust before this years broadcast the online news website VnExpress quoted Mr Minh of Vietnam Television as saying that ministers always ask the shows management  make the Kitchen ds script gentle And in response  rumors that this years show might be the last a Facebook group popped up  save itThe shows direcr Do Thanh Hai declined repeated interview requests and members of his cast could not be reached for commentPeter B Zinoman a professor of Southeast Asian hisry at the University of California Berkeley and edir in chief of the Journal of Vietnamese Studies said the Kitchen ds show had never struck him as particularly innovative  and certainly not now at a time when so many Vietnamese writers are going online  voice razorsharp critiques of government policy He said the rumors that the show might be canceled could have been a marketing ployHowever Professor Zinoman added that the show may function as a safety valve for the airing of grievances about lowlevel malfeasanceOn Wednesday several Vietnamese watching the show on a narrow lane near Xa Dan Road in Hanoi said they had been looking forward  it all yearIts criticism but in a funny way said Pham Minh Hieu a university student who watched with his mother father a cousin and a grandfather He said the show had become part of their New Years Eve routine along with ancesr worship and a viewing of fireworks at midnightA neighbor Mong Thi Chien said the show was not only about entertainment she was always interested  know what policies and events it would define as good or bad and what hidden questions it might raise about government accountability or lack thereofNguyen Ba Tien the driving instrucr admitted he was not sure whether the show was censored much less whether it was trying  make a larger point about government policyBut he said The jokes are funny because theyre trueCollapse,banking

For years Fernando Lopezs srefront moneytransfer business in Atlantic City was a place where local residents could wire money  family and friends abroad But that business Interamericana Express which handled a lot of transmittals  Mexico is dwindling as banks and regulars take a stricter view of crossborder money transfersMr Lopezs business accounts have been closed several times in recent years  three different banks over moneylaundering concerns despite his state license hours of compliance training and binders full of rules and regulations Since being dropped  the banks he has operated his moneytransfer business as an agent of MoneyGram International and Ria Money Transfer depositing transfers in accounts at those companies Banks will not take any of his moneytransfer business directlyFrustrated he is trying  convert his shop which also offers notary and bill payment services in a thepound parcel shipping center The banks dont see a small business with a moneytransfer operation in a good way Mr Lopez saidWe comply with all the regulations We have  follow the rules he said But they dont want  deal with usBanks are refusing  do business with money transmitters closing or freezing their accounts over concerns about money laundering and extra regulary scrutinyThe affected businesses include momandpop convenience sres such as Mr Lopezs potentially limiting options for the millions of people living in the United States who want  send money home or forcing them  send cash which is risky Over onequarter of American households rely on nonbank financial institutions including money transmitters for everyday banking needs according  the Conference of State Bank SupervisorsLarge banks are just walking away from the business completely said Peter Ohser

identity of the final cusmer in a money transfer remittance companies and their agents are being categorized as a high risk for money laundering and denied banking services We are part of the collateral damage Mr Aldridge saidHe added he had considered buying three convenience sres in the Atlanta area and getting a moneytransferring license but he was ld  his bank  First Citizens Bank in Raleigh NC  that it would no longer be able  work with him if the sres were transferring money abroadA spokeswoman for First Citizens Bank Barbara Thompson said that she was not aware of Mr Aldridges experience and that the bank did provide services  moneytransfer companies that were registered with state and federal authoritiesWells Fargo is one bank that still offers services  moneytransfer companies and their agents who send money from the United States  Mexico But the bank provides such services only  companies or agents with which it has a relationship and it puts them through ugher checks than it does with other cusmers a bank spokesman saidA Bank of America spokeswoman declined  comment JPMorgan and Citigroup did not respond  questions about their policy ward moneytransfer companies and agentsRegulars are aware of the problems that money transmitters are facing they say the situation is part of a wider trend of banks closing potentially risky accounts because of the costs of moniring and complianceAmong other facrs accounts may be dropped for very legitimate reasons including suspicions of illicit activity or account holders not having the appropriate controls in place said Daniel L Glaser assistant Treasury secretary for terrorist financing The fact that over the same time period the overall level of USMexico remittances appears  be healthy and growing may indicate that some of the weaker institutions are losing access and the market may be consolidating under stronger participants  which would not be a bad thingWhat you dont see behind the scenes is that prices are going up said Mr Ohser of MoneyGram A lack of banks willing  provide account services  any business that is transferring money  Mexico is causing friction and leading  increased costs Mr Ohser saidRegulars say they are growing concerned that people will resort  sending cash across the border which is harder  track and riskier Money transmitters going out of business could lead remittance senders  use informal methods that are less detectable according  a vernment Accountability Office report published in January this yearArmored cars and courier services taking currency across the border have drawn the attention of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network known as FinCen which last year began investigating an increase in suspicious dollar currency shipments FinCen investigars along with Cusms and Border Protection and Immigration and Cusms Enforcement have since tightened moniring of border cash transitThe Treasury Department is working closely with Mexican authorities  address the difficulties that moneyservice businesses on both sides of the border are facing Mr Glaser said Its a priority for us that remittance channels remain openVarious international organizations are also working on efforts  help the moneytransfer industry get access  banks The Financial Stability Board in Switzerland has been coordinating those efforts since noting that the trend of banks withdrawing services  other banks  known as correspondent banking  has the potential  rise  a systemic issueOpinions are not changing quickly enough for people like Mr Lopez however He

WASHINGTON   In 2004 relatives of some American citizens killed or injured  terrorist attacks in Israel sought redress in an unusual way They filed a multibilliondollar lawsuit against Arab Bank the largest financial institution in Jordan accusing it of transferring funds  Hamas leaders and other terrorists responsible for the attacksA decade later the case has provoked a significant split in the Obama administration according  current and former officials pitting the State Department which wants the administration  come  the banks aid against the Treasury and Justice Departments which want the government  stay out of it The case is scheduled  go  trial in AugustBut Arab Bank has asked the Supreme Court  intervene now and overturn sanctions imposed  the trial judge when the bank refused  turn over private cusmer records The Supreme Court has asked whether the government thinks it should hear the case and the Obama administration is at an impasse over what  tell the justicesThe quandary facing the administration stems from the unusual tradeoffs between issues that are rarely linked including diplomatic efforts  achieve Middle East peace the rights of American victims of terrorism and an American campaign  tear down Swiss banking secrecy laws that have long aided tax evasionThe lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Brooklyn Known as Linde v Arab Bank in its current form it focuses on the deaths of 39 Americans and the injury of 102 others in two dozen terrorist attacks during the second intifada in the early 2000s The plaintiffs contend the Jordanian bank transferred money  Hamas leaders and administered a Saudifunded program that paid a standard benefit of 5316  thousands of families of people killed in the conflict with Israel including several suicide bombersThe judge also restricted the banks ability  present information  the jury that could rebut that conclusion such as bringing up the secrecy laws Arab Bank called those sanctions draconian and appealedThe Office of the State Department Legal Adviser the officials said has strongly urged Mr Verrilli  back Supreme Court intervention on behalf of Arab Bank It cited the role Jordan plays as an American ally on matters like the war in Syria counterterrorism investigations and the IsraeliPalestinian peace processThe State Departments arguments appear  closely track those made  the government of Jordan which hired Neal K Katyal a former acting solicir general in the Obama administration  file a brief before the Supreme Court The bank has hired Paul Clement who served as solicir general in the George W Bush administrationPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersThe Jordanian brief said the country is a vital ally of Secretary of State John Kerrys renewed peace efforts between Israel and Palestinians And it warned that proceeding  a trial under the sanctions order could devastate the bank and destabilize the economies of Jordan the Palestinian terriries and the surrounding regionOn the other side are some lawyers with the Justice Departments National Security Division and with the appellate section of its Civil Division who are reluctant  have the government intervene against American victims of terrorist attacks officials saidThe Justice Departments Tax Division and the Treasury Department have raised a different concern The Internal Revenue Service is cracking down on tax evasion and if the Justice Department says foreign bank secrecy laws should take precedence it could complicate their efforts  overcome such laws in Switzerland and elsewhere officials saidSwiss banking secrecy laws were an impenetrable barrier for generations But in 2009 amid the financial crisis the Swiss government and UBS agreed  turn over information about accounts belonging  Americans and UBS paid a 780 million fineThe United States has built on that precedent  seek access throughout the Swiss banking system and may expand that effort  Luxembourg Israel and Hong Kong said William Sharp of Sharp Partners an international law firm that focuses on taxation issuesTo say that this Lebanese and Jordanian information is protected  secrecy laws would seem  be contrary  what is going on within the Department of Justice and the IRS he said I understand why DOJ and the IRS would not be happy with thisProponents of helping Arab Bank have argued that Mr Verrilli could say that respect for foreign bank secrecy laws should give way when the government seeks information  enforce laws but not when people sue for civil damages officials said But internal critics of intervening have argued that the bank can make that argument itselfAll we want is a fair trial he said We feel there are very compelling defenses and wed like  be able  present them,banking

Several million people have responded since Mr Lew issued an unprecedented invitation  the public last June  help redesign the nations cash His question Which woman from American hisry should be chosen as the first on paper currency since Martha Washingn briefly graced the 1 silver certificate in the late 19th centuryThe outpouring of responses about the forthcoming redesign of the 10 bill has surprised administration officials both  its numbers and  the volume of unanticipated complaints forcing Mr Lew  miss his selfimposed December deadline for an announcement and leaving unclear when he will decideI think it ok us all  surprise just how much interest there really was Rosie Rios the treasurer of the United States said in an interviewMr Lew intended  inspire a national conversation about womens contributions  the nation and  generate ideas for new symbols  reflect democracy on currency   make a statement about who we are and what we stand for as he saidWhat he got besides was something of a tempest that included reflections about the worth of women and about the relative merits of two particular men Alexander Hamiln a founding father and President Andrew Jackson whose portraits are on the 10 and 20 notes The comments showed Jackson  be as reviled as Hamiln is revered reviving an argument that the 20 bill should be redesigned before the 10 noteAll of this simmers as Mr Lew is preoccupied with more typical matters for a Treasury secretary In the last week he was in Puer Rico  deal with its debt crisis then in Davos Switzerland for the annual World Economic ForumYet the issue of how the 10 bill looks could well be the one for which he is best rememberedBy law the honoree must be dead Surveys from advocacy groups and social media postings suggest that the contenders include the abolitionist Harriet Tubman the suffragist Susan B Anthony the civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and Eleanor Roosevelt the reformist first lady who was a member of the first United States delegation  the United NationsThe problem for the critics is not the administrations idea of choosing a woman  with the exception of a few respondents like the man who posted on Twitter that he would demand two fives if ever handed a 10 note featuring a woman Rather the common gripe is that the 20 bill was not chosen instead of the 10 bill for a womans portraitTo the bureaucrats the choice of the 10 was natural and justifiable For security reasons the 10 bill was recommended for revision in 2012  the Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence committee that is led  Ms Rios and has representatives from the Treasury the Federal Reserve the Secret Service and the Bureau of Engraving and PrintingSo the 10 note became the vehicle for an administration eager  make a hisric statement about women before President Obama leaves office Despite the complaints officials say they cannot switch billsYet they might have better anticipated the blowback critics sayBarbara Ortiz Howard the founder of Women On 20s was at Mr Lews announcement last June They were all excited with their plan and we had some cautions she said We thought there might be some issues with it  like the fact that its not the 20The bigger issue however turned out  be Hamiln versus Jackson Many respondents asked Why displace Hamiln the first Treasury secretary and the architect of the American financial system rather than eject Jackson from the 20 bill given his record of violence against Native Americans and opposition  national bankingTreasurys initial assurance that Hamiln would somehow remain on the 10 bill presumably as a secondary figure only provoked more objections If she is worthy of being on a bill she is worthy of not sharing it a woman wrote on The New York Timess Facebook pageJust last week Senar James Lankford Republican of Oklahoma a state that is 9 percent Native American sponsored a resolution calling for Jackson  be replaced  a woman because of Jacksons policies that forced thousands of American Indians off their ancestral homelandsA group called the Alexander Hamiln Awareness Society began a social media campaign  SaveHamiln on the 10 note Rand Scholet the groups founder said in an interview that while Treasurys initiative is very laudable the reaction among Hamilnians is How can a current secretary of Treasury displace or diminish the first secretary of TreasuryWomen On 20s has proposed a compromise supported  NOW  keep Hamiln alongside a woman chosen  Treasury and change the opposite side of the 10 bill replacing the image of the Treasury building with a vignette of nearly a dozen female hisrical figuresThats not in lieu of having the prime terriry which is the portrait side Ms Howard said A womans portrait could replace Jacksons the next time the 20 note is redesigned she saidTreasury officials continue  promote the 10 redesign however Besides relying on social media emails and letters Mr Lew and Ms Rios have held wn hall meetings around the country and round tables with interested groups including hisrians Ms Rios has mingled among urists at the Bureau of Engraving and Printings money facries here and in Fort Worth soliciting opinions from scores at a timeIts  their credit that theyve opened themselves up  all this dialogue Ms Howard saidBank notes and the portraits on them have not changed significantly since 1929 But in the 1990s the government began routinely redesigning each denomination in turn  stay ahead of counterfeiters  a process of technological research testing and production that takes years for each noteMr Lew will announce his decision in the near future Ms Rios said but the new note will not go in circulation until 2020 because of the complexities of producing the anticounterfeiting features Further complicating the process as a consequence of a 2008 court order the 10 bill will also be the first  include a raised tactile feature so that people with visual impairments can readily identify

the citys first AfricanAmerican parks commissioner under Mayor Edward I KochThis was when things began  speed up as a new generation of AfricanAmerican business executives began deploying their considerable financial resources ward organizations that had looked about as integrated as a night at the opera circa 1883Most of these glassceiling breakers were born around the final days of segregation Many went  Harvard for business or law degrees and raised money for Barack ObamaAfricanAmericans do not have a long tradition of wealth like the Rockefellers Vanderbilts or Whitneys said Faye Wattlen one of more than a dozen black board members of Jazz at Lincoln Center We still are not at parity  any means But there is an emerging class of significant wealth in the AfricanAmerican community that is now in great demandThree colleges three degrees said Mr McGuire who then went  New York where he held jobs at a series of big firms and achieved business and philanthropic successes that amplified each otherThe first places he became a trustee were the International Center of Phography and the New Museum In 1994 he was elected  the board of the Whitney where he said he never felt like a ken despite being the boards only AfricanAmericanI always thought it was an assessment of my ability  add value he saidIn addition  becoming friends with longtime Whitney patrons the business titans Leonard Lauder and Thomas Lee Mr McGuire got  know a young curar named Thelma lden who is black and had interned at the Studio Museum in Harlem while she was a student at Smith CollegeShe was who introduced me  collecting art Mr McGuire saidHe was later asked  join the boards of the New York Public Library Lincoln Center and NewYorkPresterian Hospital hosted chats with political figures ranging from Bill Bratn  Mr Obama and amassed one of the most significant collections of AfricanAmerican art in the country which Ms lden advised him onToday Ms lden is the direcr and chief curar of the Studio Museum where Mr McGuire is chairman of the boardDiversifying the leadership positions at the big cultural institutions south of Harlem has proved more elusiveFor many years I said This just doesnt go We serve a population said Agnes Gund president emerita of MoMA who is white and has helped lead efforts  make its board look more like New York It wasnt a popular opinionIt looked lovely he said I saw picturesOn the other he worries about the focus on board diversity there and elsewhere obscuring the issue of what happens when a small group of wealthy patrons controls a large cultural nonprofitI have not borne witness almost anywhere  people saying This is not how things should be Dr Muhammad saidIm Negro rich not MoMA rich Mr Hudgins said laughing If you look at the billionaires that keep coming on this board its mindboggling Just mindbogglingBut Mr Hudgins has clearly added value  the museum The museum on West 53rd Street now includes a trove of pieces  AfricanAmericans that he donated including works  Senga Nengudi Henry Taylor and David HammonsLast year Mr Hudgins helped recruit another black trustee Edith Cooper Harvard College 1984 the global head of human capital management at ldman SachsMr Hudgins and his wife Thelma have grown close  Henry and MarieJose Kravis who in recent years have added works  nonwhite artists like Mark Bradford Kevin Beasley and Oscar Murillo  the walls of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts the 51 billion private equity firm founded  Mr Kravis and his partnersAnd when Ms Kravis met Mr Murillo it was Mr Hudgins who introduced themACs really been an energizing force at MoMA Ms Kravis said Hes a terrific additionHow does she respond  Dr Muhammads concerns that o much power is in the hands of the benevolent richKhalil is right she said We are a private institution We dont get any operating revenue from government and its expensive  operate so we have  be sensitive  our financial needs But we have three million visirs a year and theyre not all wealthy people Ive often said we have  be an agora not a templeIn addition  his work as head of the Ford Foundation Darren Walker is a vice chairman at New York City Ballet A former investment banker and professor of urban development he has a deep understanding of the interplay between the new class of AfricanAmerican cultural heavyweights and the citys elite institutions as both an observer and participant if often an ambivalent oneThe boards of all these organizations are receiving contradicry messages Mr Walker said On one hand theyre being ld You have  raise more private money On the other theyre being ld You need  diversify and elect people who may or may not be able  raise that moneyIt was a balmy Sunday afternoon and Mr Walker 56 was sitting in the lob of the Hiln hotel on East 42nd Street a location he selected because the near Ford Foundations environmentally conscious airconditioning had been turned off for the dayIf there were more public money there would be more public subsidy he said Unfortunately theres less public money We dont want ticket prices  go up So where is this money going  come fromThe problem has become more apparent as these organizations steer hundreds of millions of dollars ward capital improvements The capacity  give is becoming the sole criteria for membership he said And it does a tremendous disservice  these organizationsIn 1992 when Mr Walker joined New York City Ballet as its second AfricanAmerican trustee while working in investment banking for the Union Bank of Switzerland he was something of an outsiderThere was one black person on the board he said And he had spped coming  meetingsYet Mr Walker who now oversees a halfbillion dollars a year in grant money  nonprofit institutions from his Ford Foundation perch grew close  a number of his white colleagues at the balletThats where I met Agnes Gund he said Thats where I met Anne BassWe went from one  five he said of New York City Ballets board And we went from one  five only because there was a commitment from the chairman and the leadership  increase diversityToday Mr Walker travels the globe with his supply of Oxford shirts and pocket squares giving speeches about economic inequality and providing advice if not always money  seemingly everyone willing  fill out a 501c3He didnt twist my arm o much Ms Lee said But he said You need  do thisYears ago while on the board of Newwn Friends School in Newwn Pa which his children attended Dr Coles heard a proverb Wealth or wisdom is usually the requirement he said and if you happen  have both even betterBy the spring of 2015 a number of the citys other cultural institutions were showing signs that they were making a conscious decision  diversify their boards The Metropolitan Museum of Art appointed three new trustees  the board two of whom were nonwhite On Lafayette Street at the Public Theater it was four out of fiveI always enjoyed the theater but what really impressed me was the multiracial multiethnic casting Mr Wilkins saidDoes the makeup of the board mirror what he has seen on the theaters stagesNot yet he said laughing But it does feel like theres a commitment  progressIn January of this year results of Mr Finkelpearls diversity study were released Amid 41 pages of graphs and tables the Ithaka analysis demonstrated that the higher the endowment of an organization the lower its number of black and Hispanic board members and senior staff members At Carnegie Hall whose board was less than 20 percent nonwhite all 10 of its officers were white though six trustees are blackFor more than 20 years its chairman was Sanford I Weill the former chief executive of Citigroup who pushed for significant capitalimprovements projects  very much like those that Mr Walker and others are concerned that boards are now overly focused onAnd they were controversial for other reasons as well In 2007 he handed what ultimately became a 230 million renovation of the concert halls headquarters  the architect Natan Bibliowicz who happened  be his soninlawIn February 2015 Carnegie Hall announced that the longtime trustee Ronald Perelman a billionaire invesr would succeed Mr Weill as chairman with Mr Weill taking the role of presidentBig change seemed somewhat unlikely but Mr Perelman had an interest in the diversity issue For one he is on the board of the Apollo Theater with his close friend Richard Parsons the AfricanAmerican former CEO of Time Warner He is also friendly with Mayor de BlasioIn July around the same time Mr Perelman recruited Mr Walker  the board of Carnegie Hall Mr Perelmans spokeswoman Christine Taylor went  lunch with Mr Finkelpearl There they hatched a plan for the Carnegie Hall diversity symposiumThen things went a little nuts at Carnegie Hall when Mr Perelman decided  really rattle the cage He suspended the artistic direcr Clive Gillinson who had been managing direcr of the London Symphony Orchestra before joining Carnegie HallThe board rushed  Mr Gillinsons defense Mr Perelman resigned When Mr Perelman showed up at Carnegie Hall on Sept 19 for the diversity symposium led  Mr Finkelpearl he and Mr Gillinson sat as far apart as possibleAs people sympathetic  Mr Gillinson cast the sry Mr Perelman quit after making a Barnumlike play  alter Carnegie Halls programming reducing its focus on classical music and trying  sign RB stars like Alicia KeysMs Taylor did not deny that Mr Perelman hoped  update the offerings but she framed it as part of a larger prodiversity plan He didnt suggest Alicia Keys  dumb Carnegie Hall down she said He did it  bring in new people who might patronize it in the futureMercedes Bass ok over as acting chairwoman with the aim that she would eventually assume the role in a longterm capacity according  three board sourcesLawyers were brought in  investigate Mr Perelmans claims and determined that Mr Gillinson had acted in good faith But that did not sp a number of its trustees that winter from voicing concern that Ms Bass  a white Upper East Side socialite  may not be the person  carry Carnegie Hall in the futureA better alternative they argued was Mr Smith For one he had recently pledged 15 million  Carnegie Hall through his Fund II Foundation as well as 50 million  Cornell Universitys College of EngineeringHe is also an AfricanAmerican man with a love for classical music and sons named Hendrix after Jimi and Legend after John which positioned him  be a potential bridge between traditionalists and the more populist camp The icing on the cake was that he had been recruited  the board in 2013  Mr GillinsonAfter the formal announcement Mr Walker praised Mr Smiths selection as a transformational moment in the life of the city In a rare interview even Mr Perelman offered measured praise From my point of view this is a step in the right direction he said I think he can have a fabulous effect if he is allowed But Dr Muhammad the former direcr of the Schomburg center cautioned against seeing Mr Smiths entry in New York cultural life as a sign that things will change in a meaningful wayWhite people are going  be wealthier on average wealthier people are going  be in leadership positions more often and in those positions theyre likely  be part of a network of people in the same social milieu Dr Muhammad said Therell continue  be people like Robert Smith who happen  be AfricanAmerican and do wonderful things but theres a giant wealth gap between blacks and whites and its only widened in the wake of the great recession Is this a sign of a trend that black people will be the heads of boards all over the country I doubt itCollapse,banking

Political EconomyGreece has no good Plan Bs Its only rational course of action is  work with its eurozone credirs  reform its economyAlexis Tsipras the prime minister is in a bind He agreed  a shortterm deal with other eurozone governments last month But he has found it difficult  sell this  hardliners in his radicalleft Syriza party back home who accuse him of making a UturnSome of the rheric since that deal from Mr Tsiprass ministerial colleagues such as promises  cancel privatizations has been troubling So have decisions such as raising the salaries of electricity workersMeanwhile Yanis Varoufakis the finance minister has sent a rather thin list of proposed reforms  his eurozone counterparts in advance of a meeting on Monday He will have much explaining  doIf Greece is  secure a longterm pact with its credirs  the end of June Mr Tsipras will have  abandon most of his election promises Given his difficulties in delivering on even the shortterm pact there is a temptation  cast around for alternativesSome members of Syriza want Greece  regain its financial independence  defaulting on its debts and cutting loose from the euro Meanwhile pundits like Wolfgang Munchau of The Financial Times want Greece  threaten  default while staying within the single currency and  use that as a tactic  secure a better deal from its credirsMr Tsipras should resist these siren voices Their advice would lead  disasterLook first at the option of default combined with leaving the euro This is superficially attractive because Greeces debt would be cut  more manageable levels while bringing back the drachma would allow the country  devalue its currency and lift its competitivenessThe snag is that the transition would be nightmarish It could be managed only  imposing severe capital controls until the new currency was introduced a process that would take several months given the need  jump through political legal and logistical hoops Otherwise the Greek people would merely take their money out of the banks knowing that their euros would be replaced with devalued drachmasCapital controls were introduced in Cyprus two years ago when its banks were restructured and are due  be lifted only this month But if controls were imposed in Greece  coincide with a default the Cypriot measures would look like a walk in the parkAfter all Cyprus did not default on its debt and was working with its credirs ward a mutually acceptable solution As a result the European Central Bank flew in piles of cash people were allowed  take 300 euros or about 325 a day out of their accounts and companies were able  pay for importsBy contrast Athens would sp paying its credirs including not just other eurozone governments but also the ECB It is pie in the sky  suppose that in such circumstances the central bank would feed the cash machines or supply liquidity so businesses could bring in vital commodities such as oil and medicines The economy would sink in a new recessionIt is not just that the transition  the drachma would be terrible The aftermath would also be appalling because taxes would have plummeted and the newly busted government would not be able  borrow abroadIn such circumstances a responsible government would tighten its belt cut spending and run a balanced budget But what chance is there that Syriza which was voted in on a promise  increase spending will do that Instead it might take the irresponsible option printing drachmas  fill the hole in its finances and so fueling inflation and ultimately hyperinflationWhat then about the other supposed Plan B defaulting while staying in the euro This would be miserable oSuch a move would bankrupt the Greek banking system as it is exposed  the state Because Athens would no longer be able  get funds from its eurozone partners  recapitalize the banks the only option would be  bail in deposirs  converting a portion of the money in their accounts in shares in the banks on the lines of what was done in Cyprus For the duration of such an operation capital controls would have  be introducedThe government meanwhile would have  balance its budget This would be hard given that the deposir bailin plus capital controls would deaden economic activityThe state might therefore be tempted  pay salaries pensions and the like with ious This would be extremely unpopular as the recipients would view them as worth a fraction of real euros The ious would start  circulate as a parallel currency trading at a discount  euros and seen as the probable precursor  the reintroduction of drachmasGiven that none of the supposed Plan Bs is any good Mr Tsiprass best bet is  convince his credirs of his good faith and push ahead with vigorous reforms in the hope that they will cut him some slack If that means breaking with his farleft faction and perhaps calling a new election so be it His duty is  the Greek people as a wholeCollapse,banking

BRUSSELS  Growing Greek antagonism ward Germany is coming at a bad time for Athens as it seeks a better debt deal with its European partnersA demand on Tuesday night  the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras for wartime reparations from Germany cast a pall over negotiations for more rescue money for Athens that began in Brussels on WednesdayGermany the biggest European lender  Greece immediately issued a cool response  Mr Tsiprass comments which were made in an address  the Greek ParliamentSteffen Seibert the spokesman for Chancellor Angela Merkel said Wednesday that the issue of compensation linked  the Nazi occupation of Greece during World War II had been legally and politically resolved We should concentrate on current issues he saidThe rancor between Athens and Berlin the two most important players in the Greek debt negotiations seemed  emphasize the gulf between them Without more loan money in the coming weeks Greece could default on debt payments That would raise the chances still seen as remote of the countrys becoming the first member  drop out of the euro currency unionThe debt talks in Brussels involving officials from Greece and representatives of lenders from the socalled troika  the European Central Bank the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund  are expected  be highly technical for now with no immediate outcomeBut the discussions along with plans for parallel talks involving credir emissaries  Athens are politically sensitive for Mr Tsipras whose Syriza party campaigned on a vow  not be bullied  the troika That might be a reason he is feeling the need  take a hard line on German reparations  an issue that resonates deeply with GreeksIt was not the first time that Mr Tsipras has raised the issue of compensation from Germany His proposal on Tuesday  set up a committee  pursue the matter may also be aimed more at buoying domestic support than at shaming Germany in easier terms on its loan programBut the clamor could prove counterproductive some experts sayMr Tsipras may have primarily had a domestic audience in mind said Guntram B Wolff the direcr of Bruegel a research organization in Brussels However in days world such a message gets discussed everywhere he added I am worried that these statements decrease German popular support for aid  Greece even furtherAdding heat  the issue the Greek justice minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos said on Wednesday that he was ready  enact a court ruling from 2000 allowing the seizure of German property in Greece as compensation for victims of a Nazi massacre in the village of Dismo Mr Paraskevopoulos suggested the timing of any such action would depend on the domestic debate over war reparations rather than on Greeces talks with credirsMr Tsipras has been forced  concede that representatives of the credirs would be allowed  visit Athens as the negotiations continue in BrusselsBecause many Greeks considered previous inspections  the foreign audirs  be a humiliation the visits are an immensely sensitive matter for Mr Tsipras and his sharpngued finance minister Yanis Varoufakis Speaking this week Mr Varoufakis condemned the way the inspecrs had previously displayed a colonial attitudeGreek officials insisted on Wednesday that any visits  foreign officials  Athens would occur only when the groups meeting in Brussels required clarifications or additional data The visits are expected  be coordinated  officials in Athens on neutral ground like a hotel rather than at government ministriesBut in practice the inspections will probably need  be more farreaching according  eurozone officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity Gathering information about the state of the Greek banking secr in particular is likely  require sustained examination of detailed accounts they saidThe comments  Mr Varoufakis  a leftist academic with a fiery ne who lacks experience in government  have helped ske weeks of tensions between Greece and its eurozone partnersAnd mounting impatience with him on the part of some of his eurozone counterparts has also prompted speculation of an enhanced role for Giannis Dragasakis the Greek deputy prime minister and a longtime politician The Irish finance minister Michael Noonan ld reporters on Monday that giving Mr Dragasakiss office oversight of the technical talks in Brussels would represent progressMr Varoufakis and officials in Athens immediately insisted that there would be no change in the way the talks were being conductedIn a sign of the high resentment in Greece ward Germany some Greek media seized on remarks made this week  Wolfgang Schuble the nononsense German finance minister interpreting them as insulting  Mr VaroufakisIn comments  reporters on Monday evening in Brussels Mr Schuble said that he and Mr Varoufakis had a long intense talk Both lamented the poor quality of some of the media coverage the German minister saidSpeaking in German Mr Schuble ld reporters that he was far from

secr and analyze why their sck prices are moving as they are The classification also forms the basis for the MSCI and SP indexesSince its inception the financial secr has included banks real estate insurance companies and diversified financial groups But in 2014 as part of regular reviews of the indexes MSCI and what  then had become SP Dow Jones Indices decided  create an 11th secr real estate They also added a subindustry group for copperDavid Blitzer managing direcr and chairman of the index committee at SP Dow Jones Indices said the decision came after lengthy debate on how real estates role in investing had changed since the standard was createdThink back  1999 or 2000 he said No one really talked about investing in real estate We were trying  recover from the tech boom and bustMr Blitzer said the teams at SP and MSCI agreed that it was time  give real estate its own secr The changes will go in effect on Aug 31 for MSCImanaged indexes and on Sept 16 for SPs indexesThe question of what the change means in the short and long term for invesrs has been the subject of much debate And that has led invesrs  think about the value of real estate investing more broadlyMr Blitzer said he was confident that the new category would make invesrs more aware of the secr Its going  raise the prominence of anything related  real estate he said Whether it makes prices of REITs go up or down its not clear  me They will get some more attention Thats a plus for an invesr who follows REITsAt its most basic the change means people who index their investments will have a more accurate way  measure the performance of individual secrs David B Mazza head of exchangetraded fund research at State Street Global Advisors said separating real estate will make the asset class seem less forbidding  individual invesrsMost invesrs already have some dedicated real estate exposure as in a REIT fund or an alternatives bucket he said What this does is make real estate less of an alternative and more of a consumer stapleKim D Arthur chief executive of Main Management in San Francisco said just having real estate separate from the broader financial category is going  show invesrs how much better real estate has performed than other secrs within that categoryREITs since 2005 are up 160 percent Mr Arthur said The banks in that group are down 30 percent People say the financials have underperformed but it hasnt been that bad Thats because its been masked  REITsRecent performance aside he noted that REITs and banks tend  react differently  interest rate movements When rates are low as they have been REITs perform better because their borrowing costs go down while their rents stay fixed When rates go up banks do better since they can charge more  lend moneyGiven this Mr Arthur said his firm is planning  sell its holdings in real estate when they get separated from the broader financial services exchangetraded fund and buy more of a financials exchangetraded fund despite the secrs poor run He is betting that interest rates are more likely  rise than  continue at low levelsDavid Lukes chief executive of Equity One a REIT that owns develops and operates shopping centers said the additional attention would be good for a REIT like his But he said he also believed that it would benefit invesrs because of the added scrutiny the secr will receive I think well see even more focus on corporate governance sustainability and dividend security he saidSeeing real estate as a standalone secr in an index could also drive more money  REITsMatt Neska domestic equity specialist at the investment banking and asset management firm William Blair in Chicago said professional invesrs had underweighted REITs  trim their overall exposure  the financial secrHe pointed  the Russell 2000 Value index where financials accounted for about 45 percent of the scks Now with the new category it will be 30 percent financials and 14 percent real estate A lot of your small and midcap value managers had about a 10 percentage point underweight  this new real estate secr he said Given that they have  close that gap or answer questionsHe added Its hard  quantify just how much capital will go in this space but it could be a tailwindOthers though argue that the REIT secr has already run up in value and that it is not only fully valued but could collapse if interest rates go upId be surprised  see what some people have talked about that there will be much more money going in said Jeanette Garretty managing direcr at Robertson Stephens in San Francisco It may be a situation of money moving away from the banking secr and following the REITs so it looks like more money going  REITsMr Mazza of State Street said the data showed that this is already happening From the beginning of the year  the end of July 61 billion has left financial exchangetraded funds and 66 billion has gone in real estate onesNew money going in REITs Ms Garretty said could come from less sophisticated invesrs For most professional managers Id be surprised if its going  change their behavior much she said But with the ongoing growth of index investing it may lead  more individuals running their own portfolios putting money in REITs because theres a real estate indexAnd that could be a problem if REITs are as overvalued as some analysts believe Theyre certainly not an underowned area but there is demand for them Mr Mazza said If we see the market pricing in an interest rate hike we might see a reversalBrett Carson direcr of research at Carson Wealth Management in Omaha takes a dimmer view still He sees the whole REIT secr as overvaluedIts a bond proxy like utilities consumer staples and telecom and thats a crowded place right now he said Valuations are stretched Maybe the fundamentals have peaked or have potentially rolled over There are some indications particularly within the commercial property market that things are beginning  erodeWhether REITs are about  crash or ascend  new heights one thing is certain The new category will help invesrs track exactly how their real estate investments are doingCollapse,banking

Urban fiction or street lit has been snubbed  the publishing industry and scorned  black intellectuals Yet these authors may just be the most successful literary couple in AmericaOne day that summer JaQuavis met a fellow dealer in a parking lot on Flints west side He was there  make a bulk sale of a quarterbrick or ninepiece  a nineounce parcel of cocaine with a street value of about 11000 In the middle of the transaction JaQuavis heard the telltale chirp of a walkietalkie His cusmer he now realized was an undercover policeman JaQuavis jumped in his car and spun out on the road with two unmarked police cars in pursuit He didnt want  get in a highspeed chase so he whipped his car in a church parking lot and made a run for it darting in an alleyway behind a row of small houses where he ssed the quarterbrick in some bushes When JaQuavis reached the small residential street on the other side of the houses he was greeted  the police who handcuffed him and went  search behind the houses where they ld him they were certain he had ditched the drugs JaQuavis had been dealing since he was 12 had amassed more than 100000 and had never been arrested Now he thought Its overBut when the police looked in the bushes they couldnt find any cocaine They interrogated JaQuavis who denied having ever possessed or sold drugs They combed the backyard alley some more After an hour of fruitless efforts the police were forced  unlock the handcuffs and release their suspectJaQuavis was baffled  the turn of events until the next day when he received a phone call The previous afternoon a 15yearold girl had been sitting in her home on the west side of Flint when she heard sirens She looked out of the window of her bedroom and watched a young man throw a package in the bushes behind her house She recognized him He was a high school classmate  a handsome charismatic boy whom she had admired from afar The girl crept outside and grabbed the bundle which she hid in her basement I have something that belongs  you Ashley Snell ld JaQuavis Coleman when she reached him  phone You wanna come over here and pick it upThat partnership turned out  be creative and entrepreneurial as well as romantic Over the past decade the Colemans have published nearly 50 books sometimes as solo writers sometimes under pseudonyms but usually as collaborars with a line that has become a trusted brand Ashley  JaQuavis They are marquee stars of urban fiction or street lit a genre whose innercity settings and lurid mix of crime sex and sensationalism have earned it comparisons  gangsta rap The emergence of street lit is one of the big sries in recent American publishing a juggernaut that has generated huge sales  catering  a readership  young black and for the most part female  that hisrically has been illserved  the book business But the genre is also widely maligned Street lit is subject  a kind of triple snobbery scorned  literati who look down on genre fiction generally ignored  a white publishing establishment that remains largely indifferent  black books and disparaged  AfricanAmerican intellectuals for poor writing coarse values and trafficking in racial stereotypesBut if a certain kind of cultural prestige is shut off  the Colemans they have reaped other rewards Theyve built a large and loyal fan base which gobbles up the new Ashley  JaQuavis titles that arrive every few months Many of those books are sold at streetcorner stands and other offthegrid venues in AfricanAmerican neighborhoods a literary gray market that doesnt register a blip on bestseller tallies Yet the Colemans most popular series now regularly crack the trade fiction bestseller lists of The New York Times and Publishers Weekly For years the pair had no literary agent they sold hundreds of thousands of books without banking a penny in royalties Still they have earned millions of dollars almost exclusively from cashformanuscript deals negotiated directly with independent publishing houses In short though little known outside of the world of urban fiction the Colemans are one of Americas most successful literary couples a distinction theyve achieved they insist because of their works gritty authenticity and their devotion  a primal literary virtue the power of the ripping yarnWhen you read our books youre gonna realize Ashley  JaQuavis are srytellers  says Ashley Our tales will get your heart poundingTHE COLEMANS HOME BASE  the cottage from which they operate their cottage industry  is a spacious fourbedroom house in a genteel suburb about 35 miles north of downwn Detroit The house is plush but when I visited this past winter it was sparsely appointed The couple had just recently moved in and had only had time  fully furnish the bedroom of their 4yearold son QuayeIn conversation Ashley and JaQuavis exude both modesty and bravado gratitude for their good fortune and bootstrappers pride in having made their own luck They talk a lot about their time in the trenches the years they spent as a drug dealer and rideordie girl tandem In Flint they learned  grind hard Writing they say is merely a more elevated kind of grindInstead of hitting the block like we used  we hit the lapps says Ashley I know what every word is worth So while Im writing Im like Okay theres a hundred dollars Theres a thousand dollars Theres five thousand dollars They maintain a rigorous regimen They each try  write 5000 words per day five days a week The writers stagger their shifts JaQuavis goes  bed at 7 pm and wakes up early around 3 or 4 in the morning  work while his wife and child sleep Ashley writes during the day often in libraries or at StarbucksThey divide the labor in other ways Chapters are divvied up more or less equally with tasks assigned according  individual strengths JaQuavis typically handles character development Ashley loves writing murder scenes The results are stitched gether with no edirial interference from one author in the others text The real work they contend is the brainsrming The Colemans spend weeks mapping out their plotdriven books  long conversations that turn in elaborate diagrams on dryerase boards JaQuavis and I are so close it makes the process real easy says Ashley Sometimes when Im thinking of something a plot point hell say it out loud and Im like Wait  did I say that Their collaboration developed  accident and on the fly Both were bookish teenagers Ashley read lots of Judy Blume and John Grisham JaQuavis liked Shakespeare Richard Wright and Atlas Shrugged Their first official date was at a Borders booksre where Ashley bought The Coldest Winter Ever the Sister Souljah novel often credited with kickstarting the contemporary streetlit movement In 2003 Ashley then 17 was forced  terminate an ecpic pregnancy She was bedridden for three weeks and  provide distraction and boost her spirits JaQuavis challenged his girlfriend  a writing contest She just wasnt talking She was laying in bed I said You know what I bet you I could write a better book than you My wife is real competitive So I said Yo all right 500 bet And I saw her eyes spark like What You cant write no better book than me So I wrote about three chapters She wrote about three chapters Two days later we switchedThe result hammered out in a few days would become Dirty Money Two years later when Ashley and JaQuavis were students at Ferris State University in Western Michigan they sold the manuscript  Urban Books a streetlit imprint founded  the bestselling author Carl Weber At the time JaQuavis was still making his living selling drugs When Ashley got the phone call informing her that their book had been bought she assumed theyd hit it big and flushed more than 10000 worth of cocaine down the ilet Their advance was a mere 4000Those advances would soon increase eventually reaching five and six figures The Colemans built their career JaQuavis says in a manner that made sense  him as a veteran dope peddler  flooding the street with product From the start they were prolific churning out books at a rate of four or five a year Their novels made their way in sres the nowdefunct chain Waldenbooks which had sres in urban areas typically passed  booksellers was a major engine of the streetlit market But Ashley and JaQuavis ok advantage of distribution channels established  pioneering urban fiction authors such as Teri Woods and Vickie Stringer and a network of streetcorner tables magazine stands corner shops and bodegas Like rappers who establish their bona fides with graymarket mixtapes streetlit authors use this system  circumnavigate industry gatekeepers bringing their work straight  the genres core readership But urban fiction has other aficionados in less likely places Our books are so popular in the prison system JaQuavis says Were banned in certain penitentiaries Inmates fight over the books  there are incidents you know I have loved ones in jail and theyre like Yo your books cant come in here Its against the rules Copulating paperbacks aside its clear that the streetlit debate is about more than literature uching on questions of paternalism versus populism and on middleclass anxieties about the black underclass Its part and parcel of black elites efforts  define not only a literary tradition but a racial politics said Kinohi Nishikawa an assistant professor of English and AfricanAmerican Studies at Princen University There has always been a sense that because AfricanAmericans opportunities  represent themselves are so limited in the first place any hint of criminality or salaciousness would necessarily be a knock on the entire racial politics One of the pressing debates about AfricanAmerican literature day is If we cant include writers like Ashley  JaQuavis  what extent is the foundation of our thinking about black literature faulty Is it just a literature for elites Or can it be inclusive bringing urban fiction under the purview of our umbrella term AfricanAmerican literatureFor their part the Colemans place their work in the broader black literary tradition You have Maya Angelou Alice Walker James Baldwin  all of these traditional black writers who wrote about the struggles of racism injustice inequality says Ashley Were writing about the struggle as it happens now Its just a different struggle Im telling my sry Im telling the struggle of a black girl from Flint Michigan who grew up on welfarePerhaps there is a highminded case  be made for street lit But the virtues of Ashley  JaQuaviss work are more basic Their novels do lack literary polish The writing is not graceful there are passages of clunky exposition and sex scenes that induce guffaws and eye rolls But the pleasure quotient is high The books flaunt a garish brand of feminism with women characters cast not just as vixens but also as gangsters  coldblooded killers murder mamas The sries are exceptionally wellplotted The Cartel opens  introducing its hero the crime boss Carter Diamond on page 9 a gunshot spatters Diamonds brain across the interior of a police cruiser The book then flashes back seven years and begins  hurtle forward again  a bullet train whizzing readers through shifting alliances romantic entanglements and betrayals kidnappings shoouts with Haitian and Dominican gangsters and a cliffhanger closing scene that leaves the novels heroine tied  a chair in a basement gruesomely rtured  the edge of death Ashley  JaQuaviss books are not Ralph Ellison certainly but they build up quite a head of steam They moveThe Colemans are moving themselves these days They recently signed a deal with St Martins Press which will bring out the next installment in the Cartel series as well as new solo series  both writers The St Martins deal is both lucrative and legitimizing  a validation of Ashley and JaQuaviss work  one of publishings most venerable houses The Colemans ambitions have grown as well A recent trilogy Murderville tackles human trafficking and the blooddiamond industry in West Africa with srylines that sweep from Sierra Leone  Mexico  Los Angeles Increasingly Ashley  JaQuavis are leaning on research  traveling  farflung settings and hitting the books in the libraries  and spending less time mining their own roughandtumble pastBut Flint remains a source of inspiration One evening not long ago JaQuavis led me on a ur of his homewn a popular roadside bar the parking lot where he met the undercover cop for the illfated drug deal Ashleys old house the site of his almostarrest He ok me  a ramshackle vehicle repair shop on Flints west side where he worked as a kid washing cars He showed me a bathroom at the rear of the garage where at age 12 he sneaked away  inspect the first boulder of crack that he ever sold A spraypainted sign on the garage wall which JaQuavis remembered from his time at the car wash offered words of warningWe still love Flint Michigan JaQuavis says Its so seedy so treacherous But theres some heart in this city This is where it all started selling books out the box In the days when we would get those little 40000 advances theyd send us a couple boxes of books for free We would hit the streets  sell our books right out of the car trunk It was a hustle It still isOne old neighborhood asset that the Colemans have not shaken off is swagger My wife is the best female writer in the game JaQuavis ld me I believe Im the best male writer in the game Im sleeping next  the best writer in the world And shes doing the same,banking

Wealth Special SectionEven before Donald J Trump defied the odds and was elected the 45th president of the United States wealthy invesrs were feeling uneasy about the level of uncertainty in the global economyWhile some people are optimistic that a Trump administration could mean tax breaks less business regulation and other benefits  the wealthy  and even the sck market eventually rose on the news  the truth is no one knows for sure what the next months or years will bringMichael W Sonnenfeldt a New Yorker who made a fortune in real estate and banking captured the level of uncertainty lately among the worlds wealthiest invesrsI cant compare this time  World War II he said But the combination of potential interest rate shocks and a China implosion and the geopolitical situations with Russia China Iran the Middle East ISIS and the difficult political situation in the US with the most challenging strangest presidential election weve had in our lifetime  it all adds up  many generic concernsHis list of woes has been common among wealthy invesrs in the United States Tony Roth the chief investment officer at the Wilmingn Trust Corporation has begun  include models for how much a client can lose in the firms new investment pitchesWhat weve done is put a new emphasis on risk which is what we call drawdown exposure Mr Roth said Its not volatility Its if we have an event how much could you loseHe said many clients had been cautious for several years when markets performed well and they missed out Now they want  take on more risk  increase their returns yet they fear having another loss as in 2008Clients are saying We have goals and we may need  take more risk  what does that mean  me Mr Roth said If you tell me I could lose 25 percent  50 percent of my portfolio that means something  meTheres a lot of uncertainty out there she added But there are also a lot of things going well  technology biopharmaceuticals peoples quality of life Even with all these good things happening thats not where the conversation is goingOf course it is easy  be pessimistic after a year of noisy election campaigns Britains Brexit vote  leave the European Union a slowdown in China saberrattling and suspected digital snooping  Russia and the slowing of Brazils economic engine  political problems and the Zika virusThe hard part is getting past that emotion said Judith B Ward senior financial planner at T Rowe Price Clients when they call us they just want reassurance  stay the course One of the things we focus on a lot is  have that longterm perspective  weather some of the srms that we might seeToday Mr Sonnenfeldt is the chairman of Tiger 21 an investment club he founded 18 years ago that has 447 members with an average wealth of 100 million In that role he likes  poll his fellow millionaires and billionaires on what concerns them and what actions they take  address those worriesRight now he said members are taking money out of the public markets and investing more in private equity deals which are far less liquid but offer higher returns for people who can afford  be patient They have minimized their personal debt gotten out of hedge funds and invested in hard assets like real estateIts back  basics on the whole he said Its less overseas adventures and more back  basics with American businesses that sell real products and services Real estate is our No 1 overall allocationTheres a general wariness about markets because there are different measures  which you can determine if the market is overpriced he added His group think the equity markets are being propped up  people who have few options and who cant invest in private dealsMr Sonnenfeldts group is not alone in taking an approach that weighs the downside as much as if not more than the upsideMr Roth sees that a lot But it has left him rn on using drawdown exposure as a ratingOn the one hand it is a useful ol for clients he said But on the other he worries that he is playing in an echo chamber of woeI want  make sure its valuable and not just pandering  the fears of our clients he said We have  make sure that the metrics that were using backtest really wellAnd he is clear in saying that he is not discarding modern portfolio theory and all of the analytical ols the investment profession has  estimate potential rewardds He is simply trying  add something that might make sense in the current age of anxietyWere running a parallel risk framework  add  the traditional risk framework he said Were trying  create a better understanding for clientsMs Patterson said one of her aims was  put what is happening day in a context of the last several years This isnt something that suddenly occurred in 2016 she said The sense that one is losing control has been an undercurrent for some timeIt is the long view of course that advisers advocate Whatever may happen between now and Inauguration Day or even later in 2017 is a blip  however painful  on peoples longterm investment plansThe risk is that so much negative news from so many places in the world has a selfsustaining effect The doom real or perceived resonates more loudly than rational calls for making a plan and sticking  itIndividual invesrs are bercareful said Edward J Perkin chief equity investment officer at Ean Vance an asset management firm Thats risky You have  take some risk or you dont meet your goalsThat much fear can be paralyzing To break that Mr Perkin said he suggested that people do something simple dollarcost averaging which means buying a certain amount of an investment in pieces in case its value goes downOf course that investments value can also go up and an invesr would have been better off putting all the money in at once But when fear is such a large force this simple strategy is a way  remove the regret facr he saidTaken a different way Richard Bernstein chief executive and chief investment officer of Richard Bernstein Advisors an investment advisory firm applies a hyperrational view  the present Even if it is bad now it will not be bad foreverPeople have completely lost sight of what is going on he said If youre 30 years old youre not retiring for another 35 years or more Time is on your side People rarely understand the value of timePeople are always scared that there is going  be a bear market but they dont think of what causes one he said Is the central bank removing liquidity Are earnings going in bearish terriry Is everyone bullish We dont have any of those thingsFor Mr Sonnenfeldt doing nothing is the worst response People have  make investment decisions as he has been doing with clean energyThe biggest shift is that in a lowinterestrate environment investing in passive assets is fraught with peril he said You cant do a 6040 split

hope  avoid similar pitfalls Rather than banking on a social media brush fire  ignite her fan base Weinstein Books is running parallel marketing campaigns one aimed at Ms McKenzies YouTube audience the other targeting potential readers who have not heard of her Author and publisher have posted a book trailer on Ms McKenzies YouTube channel and sent galleys  influential video bloggers but they are also courting booksellers librarians and readers of young adult and paranormal fiction Ms McKenzie sent letters written in the voice of Sunshine  book buyers at Barnes  Noble sres Weinstein printed 2000 galleys of the first book and made it available digitally for reviewers on the website odreadsWhile she has a tremendous fan base we can market  directly we didnt know if the people who love Sunshine and watched her grow up are readers and book buyers said Georgina Levitt the publishing direcr of Weinstein Books We didnt want people  feel like this was a derivative work of a

hit citing strong results from an informal focus group I have four daughters and three of them are in Sunshine Girl  Mr Weinstein said calling the sry Buffy the Vampire Slayer for a new generationSunshine Girl was never just a teenager messing around with a handheld camera despite the spontaneous home videofeel of the showNone of this was  accident said Mercedes Rose Ms McKenzies mother costar and business partner We always thought the numbers would get so large that Hollywood would have  pay attentionThe project started in 2010 when a film producer Nick Hagen contacted Ms Rose an actress and voiceover artist about collaborating on a YouTube show He chose the haunted house theme partly because the subject proved popular when he did a reverse keyword search  see what people were looking for on YouTubeAt the time the No 2 search subject was ghost and No 1 was Lil Wayne and you cant do a whole channel on Lil Wayne Ms McKenzie saidMs Rose her daughter and Mr Hagen formed a production company Coat Tale Productions They quickly learned some tricks for luring in viewers like posting warnings on the videos that say Dont Watch Rumors swirled helpfully that the ghostly apparitions were real Nearly a year later the videos passed five million views The show now brings in around 6000 a month in advertisingMs McKenzie who is now 20 and lives outside of Portland Ore says Sunshines character is 998 percent based on her She spent much of her adolescence in front of the camera When she was harassed at school she spoke about it on camera as Sunshine She griped on the show about her wheat allergy and her frizzy hair I pretty much grew up on YouTube she said This is my fulltime job This is my lifeIn 2013 the literary agent Mollie Glick saw a feature on Ms McKenzie in Seventeen magazine and asked her if she was interested in writing a novel based on her show Ms Glick paired Ms McKenzie with a young adult novelist Alyssa B Sheinmel who wrote three sample chapters and an outline A book deal quickly followed Last spring Weinstein bought a partial manuscript at auction  in a lowsixfigure twobook deal  and separately optioned screen rights The company plans  expand the Sunshine series and recently bought a third bookWhen we saw the enthusiasm building from booksellers we reached out  the agent  get a third book going said David Steinberger

Importance of PlaceThe results were deeply disappointing Parents who received the vouchers did not seem  earn more in later years than otherwise similar adults and children did not seem  do better in school The programs apparent failure has haunted social scientists and policy makers making poverty seem all the more intractableThe city is especially harsh for boys Lowincome boys who grew up there in recent decades make roughly 25 percent less as adults than similar lowincome boys who were born in the city and moved as small children  an average placeChildren growing up in some places go on  earn more than they would if they had grown up elsewhereThe places where poor children face the worst odds include some  but not all  of the nations largest urban areas like Atlanta Chicago Los Angeles Milwaukee Orlando West Palm Beach and Tampa in Florida Austin Tex the Bronx and the parts of Manhattan with lowincome neighborhoodsAll else equal lowincome boys who grow up in such areas earn about 35 percent less on average than otherwise similar lowincome children who grow up in the best areas for mobility For girls the gap is closer  25 percentMany of these places have large AfricanAmerican populations and the findings suggest that race plays an enormous but complex role in upward mobility The nations legacy of racial inequality appears  affect all lowincome children who live in heavily black areas Both black and white children seem  have longer odds of reaching the middle class and both seem  benefit from moving  better neighborhoodsThe places most conducive  upward mobility include large cities  San Francisco San Diego Salt Lake City Las Vegas and Providence RI  and major suburban counties such as Fairfax Va Bergen NJ Bucks Pa Macomb Mich Worcester Mass and Contra Costa CalifThese places tend  share several traits Mr Hendren said They have elementary schools with higher test scores a higher share of twoparent families greater levels of involvement in civic and religious groups and more residential integration of affluent middleclass and poor familiesFor lowincome families a home in places with these characteristics is often a financial stretch Rachelle Hawkins a 32yearold single mother in California rented an apartment in Contra Costa late last year with help from a Contra Costa nonprofit called Shelter Inc which paid her first months rent She moved from a gritty neighborhood near Oakland and was homeless for a time She makes about 29000 as a cusmerservice agent in online banking and faces an annual rent bill of almost 17000But she thinks the burden is worth it for her children who are 4 and 6 I dont think my kids are going  remember what we went through Ms Hawkins said They are absolutely better off just because of the environmentIn both studies the younger children were when they moved the better they did Children were less likely  become single parents when they grew up were more likely  go  college and  earn more The original research had not been able  follow the economic outcomes of younger children because not enough time had passed Mr Katz saidStill the more extensive nationwide data on moving found that older children were also affected  their neighborhood The effect was what statisticians call linear Each additional year in a different place had roughly the same average effect on a childs adult earnings A teenagers year in a better neighborhood mattered as much as a 9yearolds year  but 9year olds still had their teenage years in front of themSome economists who have seen the new study say that it argues for a new approach  housing policy Current policy often forces the parents of young children on waiting lists for housing vouchers It also gives tax incentives  developers who build in poor neighborhoods rather than rewarding those who build affordable housing in areas that seem  offer better environmentsIn an interview Friday Julin Castro the secretary of Housing and Urban Development said he was excited  the new data Mr Castro said his department had been planning  reallocate funding so that some people moving  more expensive neighborhoods would receive larger vouchers Currently the value of vouchers tends  be constant across a metropolitan areaThe large county on the other end of the spectrum from Baltimore with the best odds of escaping poverty is Du County Ill west of Chicago It contains suburbs where the schools are considered better and where housing costs more than in Chicago and some closein suburbsBriana her daughter was hesitant about leaving her friends but Mrs Polk insisted saying they could still visit them I knew absolutely it would mean better possibilities for my kids she saidMrs Polk earns about 40000 a year at a company that helps clear goods through cusms She has been able  afford the move  living in a cramped 1025amonth onebedroom apartment  and with help from a county program that gives them about 2000 a year ward living expensesHer son Jovan graduated from high school last year and is now working while Briana will graduate this spring Both plan  enroll in community college in the next yearAlthough most places with better odds of escaping poverty have higher rent the researchers did identify some counties as upwardmobility bargains These include Putnam County NY parts of the Pittsburgh and Alona areas in Pennsylvania and if only relative  surrounding areas Contra CostaThe study defined low income as the 25th percentile of the income distribution  a household earning less than threequarters of other households nationally or about 30000 a year for families with children But the analysis covered the full income distribution and the geographic patterns at the 25th percentile were very similar  those for poorer and somewhat less poor householdsThe data suggests otherwise The easiest way  understand the pattern may be the different effects on siblings who have so much in common Younger siblings who moved from a bad area  a better one earned more as adults than their older siblings who were part of the same move The particular environment of a city really does seem  affect its residentsThe data does not answer the question of whether the facrs that distinguish highermobility places like better schools and less economic segregation are causing the differences  or are themselves knockon effects of other underlying causes We still need clarity on that Mr Grusky the Stanford professor saidFrom her perspective Ms Hawkins the Contra Costa resident said that the mixing of people from different social classes did make a differenceIts all spread out here she said In her old home in San Leandro Calif entire neighborhoods had high unemployment and crime which led some people who did have jobs  flee causing a downward spiral You dont want  put your kid in harms way Thats just extra stressFor all the benefits that moves can bring they are not a solution  poverty said people who have seen the new paper as well as the researchers themselves Finding ways  improve those neighborhoods for people who cannot or do not want  move is also important researchers and policy makers

PARIS  Mario Draghi the European Central Bank president strongly signaled on Friday that he and his colleagues were preparing a new round of powerful monetary stimulus  jolt the flagging eurozone economyWhile slowing growth was the reason for Beijings move in Europe the big concern is a worrisomely low inflation rate that is both a sympm and cause of the 18nation euro currency unions inability  achieve any sustainable growth at allSpeaking at a banking conference in Frankfurt Mr Draghi said the European Central Bank would do what we must  raise inflation and inflation expectations as fast as possibleIf the banks current policies which include some purchases of corporate bonds do not end the threat Mr Draghi said we would step up the pressure and broaden even more the channels through which we intervene  altering accordingly the size pace and composition of our purchasesAt issue is whether the European Central Bank will follow its peers around the world including the Federal Reserve in the United States the Bank of Japan and the Bank of England in buying government bonds on a large scale a policy known as quantitative easingWith interest rates around most of the developed world having been effectively cut  as low as they can go conventional monetary policy has reached its zero lower bound While there is no consensus on the effectiveness of quantitative easing many economists point  the relatively strong British and American recoveries as evidence that it worksThe risk Mr Draghi now runs is that unless the central banks actions keep pace with his words he can lose credibility Many economists have been pushing for most of this year for the central bank  take more aggressive stimulus steps while Mr Draghi in his monthly news conferences has been saying the equivalent of stay tunedIf after Fridays statements Mr Draghi is unable  announce significant new measures when he and his governing council meet in early December the financial markets could register their disappointment Some analysts immediately predicted though that Mr Draghi was simply trying  buy more timeMr Draghi will find himself even more on the spot at the December meeting if a closely watched report on eurozone inflation next week shows prices falling furtherMr Draghi spoke Friday as the worlds central banks are increasingly concerned that very low inflation will tip in outright deflation  a selfreinforcing condition in which consumers and businesses put off purchases and investments in the expectation that prices will fall Deflation can also crush fragile borrowers  raising the real interest rate on their loans which would load weak banks with a new round of defaults on loansEurozone consumer prices rose just 04 percent in Ocber far below the central banks target of close  but less than 2 percent In fact some member states have already begun  experience deflation Mr Draghi and his peers are afraid that consumers and invesrs will increasingly see low inflation as the new normal creating a selffulfilling prophecyThe European Central Bank in September cut its main interest rate target  a rockbotm 005 percent and reduced its deposit rate  minus 02 percent effectively charging banks for leaving unused funds at the central bank The bank has been buying privatesecr loan assets since early Ocber And it has announced longerterm lowinterest loans  banks in an effort  restart lendingSo far that has not been enough Recently Mr Draghi has said the central bank intends  expand the size of its balance sheet  that is  inject money in the market   1 trillion euros or about 125 trillion Economists say the current measures fall far short of what is needed  hit that levelMichel Martinez chief eurozone economist with Socit Gnrale noted that Mr Draghi had not provided much detail about his inflationfighting plans Mr Martinez said he expected the central bank  increase its purchases of privatesecr assets including packages of housing loans known as covered bonds as well as of debt issued  agencies like the European Investment BankBut when you do the math you make a rough assumption that the ECB takes 20 percent of all those available assets Mr Martinez said Thats barely 400 billionIf Mr Draghi is going  hit his target Mr Martinez added obviously the answer is  purchase government bondsExpectations that the central bank will increase the supply of euros in the market led invesrs  sell the European currency in favor of dollars particularly as the Federal Reserve has begun reining in its own bondbuying The euro fell about 1 percent  12438 in afternoon trading The Euro Sxx 50 index gained 297 percent Yields on Spanish and Italian 10year bonds fell roughly 1 percentAnd yet the path  employing wholesale bondbuying is not an easy one There is significant opposition  such a policy in Germany for example and even if the political hurdles are overcome economists say they wonder whether the eurozone  in which each country rather than the bloc as a whole issues bonds  is the appropriate venue for quantitative easingTwo of Germanys gatekeepers on the question of quantitative easing  the governments finance minister Wolfgang Schuble and the German central banks president Jens Weidmann  addressed the same conference on Friday but declined  comment on Mr Draghis speechIn any case Mr Martinez said he was not convinced that Mr Draghi was ready  act in the near term perhaps not before next summerThe ECB is buying time in the hope that the outlook improves he saidGuntram B Wolff who follows the European economy as direcr of the Brusselsbased research institute Bruegel agreedMy take is that it will still take some time before Mr Draghi commits  buying government bonds Mr Wolff said My sense is that the German government is moving ward the position that this may have  happen at some point  prevent a catastrophe in terms of prolonged low inflation or even deflation It has serious implications for Germany

HONG KONG  The Chinese government has adopted new regulations requiring companies that sell computer equipment  Chinese banks  turn over secret source code submit  invasive audits and build socalled back doors in hardware and software according  a copy of the rules obtained  foreign technology companies that do billions of dollars worth of business in ChinaThe new rules laid out in a 22page document approved at the end of last year are the first in a series of policies expected  be unveiled in the coming months that Beijing says are intended  strengthen cybersecurity in critical Chinese industries As copies have spread in the past month the regulations have heightened concern among foreign companies that the authorities are trying  force them out of one of the largest and fastestgrowing marketsIn a letter sent Wednesday  a plevel Communist Party committee on cybersecurity led  President Xi Jinping foreign business groups objected  the new policies and complained that they amounted  protectionismThe groups which include the US Chamber of Commerce called for urgent discussion and dialogue about what they said was a growing trend ward policies that cite cybersecurity in requiring companies  use only technology products and services that are developed and controlled  Chinese companiesAlthough it is unclear  what extent the new rules result from security concerns and  what extent they are cover for building up the Chinese tech industry the Chinese regulations go far beyond measures taken  most other countries lending some credibility  industry claims that they are protectionist Beijing also has long used the Internet  keep tabs on its citizens and ensure the Communist Partys hold on powerChinese companies must also follow the new regulations though they will find it easier since for most their core cusmers are in ChinaChinas Internet filters have increasingly created a world with two Internets a Chinese one and a global one The new policies could further split the tech world forcing hardware and software makers  sell either  China or the United States or  create significantly different products for the two countriesWhile the Obama administration will almost certainly complain that the new rules are protectionist in nature the Chinese will be able  make a case that they differ only in degree from Washingns own requirementsThe United States has made it virtually impossible for Huawei a major Chinese maker of computer servers and cellphones  sell its products in the United States arguing that its equipment could have back doors for the Chinese governmentThe documents released  Edward J Snowden the former National Security Agency contracr revealed a major effort  the agency  enter Huaweis systems both  figure out who controls the company and  create back doors that the United States could exploitRecent calls  the direcr of the Federal Bureau of Investigation James B Comey  assure that the United States has a key  decrypt information sred on iPhones and other devices will doubtless be used  the Chinese  argue that all governments need access  sensitive computer systemsAnalysts said new Chinese policies like the bank rules and an antiterrorism law that is still in draft form would make doing business increasingly difficult in China for foreign hardware and software companiesI think theyre obviously targeting foreign vendors that are operating in China said Matthew Cheung a researcher at the analytics firm Gartner They are promoting the local technologies so that local providers who have the capabilities  provide systems  these enterprises can get more market shareFor instance the bank rules say 75 percent of technology products used  Chinese institutions must be classified as secure and controllable  2019Though analysts say secure and controllable  a phrase that peppers several new Chinese technology policies  may be open  interpretation a chart attached  the banking regulations shows the troubles foreign companies could have in winning that classification for their productsFor most computing and networking equipment the chart says source code must be turned over  Chinese officials But many foreign companies would be unwilling  disclose code because of concerns about intellectual property security and in some cases United States export lawThe chart also calls for companies that want  sell  banks  set up research and development centers in China obtain permits for workers servicing technology equipment and build ports  allow Chinese officials  manage and monir data processed  their hardwareThe draft antiterrorism law pushes even further calling for companies  sre all data related  Chinese users on servers in China create methods for moniring content for terror threats and provide keys  encryption  public security authoritiesBanking is the first industry where we are aware a blackandwhite regulary document was issued said Jeffrey Yao a vice president for enterprise research at IDC In some other industries if you talk  the cusmers many of them get the pressure  adopt the local brands but in most of the cases they are via internal communications from the p officersSome of Americas largest tech companies could be hurt  the rules including Apple which is making a big push in the country Apple has used new encryption methods in the iPhone 6 that are based on a complicated mathematical algorithm tied  a code unique  each phone Apple says it has no access  the codes but under the proposed antiterrorism law it would be required  provide a key so that the Chinese government could decrypt data sred on iPhonesA growing number of American technology executives have complained about new barriers  access  the Chinese market John T Chambers the chief executive of the network equipment maker Cisco Systems has raised the issue as have executives at the chip maker Qualcomm This week Microsofts chief executive Satya Nadella said his company was working through geopolitical issues regarding ChinaIn the letter the Western companies voiced concerns about a broader cybersecurity review regime under which the Chinese government would assess the security and controllability of hardware software and technology services sold in China through audits and other checks More details about the checks will be sent in February  the Central Leading Group for Cyberspace Affairs the committee led  the Chinese president according  a recent report  Xinhua the staterun news agencyThe committee which was created after the disclosures  Mr Snowden is leading the charge in consolidating and streamlining online security efforts in China Analysts said it had most likely presided over or given tacit support  the new policiesThe leadership committee is said  be also trying  wean the country from its reliance on foreign technology a longstanding goal that has gained urgency after Mr Snowdens revelationsZuo Xiaodong vice president of the China Information Security Research Institute said the new policies and the broader push for indigenous innovation were not intended  eliminate foreign companies from the marketWere under the yoke of others If the others sp services what do we do he said noting that many Chinese companies and local governments had  scramble when Microsoft discontinued its support of Windows XP From a security perspective that simply wasnt acceptable Were breaking away from these types of circumstancesEven if Beijing wants it  the banking industry cannot immediately do away with all foreign hardware makers Mr Yao of IDC said Banks purchase billions of dollars worth of hardware and software  manage transactions and Chinese companies cannot yet produce some of the higherend servers and mainframes they rely onMr Yao said 90 percent of highend servers and mainframes in China were still produced  multinationals Still Chinese companies are catching up at the lower endFor all enterprise hardware local brands

OpEd ContribursThe United States along with France Germany Britain China and Russia reached a hisric deal with Iran last July that lifts most sanctions in return for curbs on Irans nuclear program The deal codified in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and endorsed  the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 specifically includes allowing nonAmerican banks  operate in IranBut European banks are still reluctant  enter Iran because they have no solid legal assurance from Washingn that its enforcement agencies would not later sue them for violating residual American sanction laws that predate the nuclear negotiations These laws are complex and ambiguous even  sophisticated legal departments in European banks So the banks understandably have been unwilling  do business with Iran and risk fines in the billions of dollars if they unwittingly violate the rulesThat reluctance has made some critics of the hisric nuclear deal question its ultimate value as a stabilizing facr in international relations and an enduring barrier  nuclear proliferationSo far political commitments  Secretary of State John Kerry and his Western counterparts not  pursue the banks have not had their intended confidencebuilding effectNevertheless European banks remain uncomfortable relying on mere words And there is no vigorous action from the American administration  better facilitate Irans access  the global financial systemIf this narrative gains momentum and wipes out the sense of hope and optimism that the nuclear deal brought  Irans business community and its general public we risk reentering the tired old path of mistrust and antagonism  a loselose paradigm for Iran the United States the Middle East and beyond It would be difficult for the two countries  cooperate on other global regional or bilateral issues And if Iranian public opinion turned despondent that alone would constitute a major obstacle  any foreseeable rapprochementTo avoid that outcome and allow full implementation of the nuclear deal European and other nonAmerican banks want concrete legal assurances from the United States government that they would not be punished if they entered IranWe firmly believe that President Obama has the power  provide such assurance and that he should use it nowTo be specific he should officially instruct his atrney general and all subordinate American enforcement agencies  refrain from prosecuting nonUnited States banks that wish  work with Iran In other words he should call a morarium on American prosecution of foreign firms sending the clear message that prosecution would not be the norm but an improbable exceptionIn sum if the president finds that Washingn politics make it impossible for him  work with Republicans  adapt domestic laws  the United States foreignpolicy needs and at this point  American obligations under international law we believe that he can and should at least use his authority over law enforcement and foreign policy  protect the achievements of the nuclear dealThe Iranian leadership and with it the Iranian public strongly believe that the American president has enough power and authority  solve the banking problem and expect Mr Obama  act accordingly We believe that European countries share this expectationBut time is running out and nobody can be sure of the outcome of the coming presidential election So Mr Obama must act as quickly as possible Prompt and specific reassurances from the administration that foreign banks would not be punished for conducting legitimate business with Iran would give financial institutions enough time  shape and sufficiently develop their business ties with Iran That in turn would make it difficult for any new administration  reverse Mr Obamas policy of constructive engagementIn other words we believe that the remaining days of the Obama administration should be devoted  consolidating and stabilizing the postagreement international order and the numerous economic political and security benefits it could bring everyoneIn the same vein it is also said in Tehran that a few serious and sizable American investments in Iran  in fields allowable under current American laws  would send a very positive message  Americas allies and allay the fear of other Western acrs who might still be reluctant  enter the Iranian sphereCollapse,banking
Mr Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential hisryWASHINGTON  In nearly eight years in office President Obama has sought  reshape the nation with a sweeping assertion of executive authority and a canon of regulations that have inserted the United States government more deeply in American lifeOnce a presidential candidate with deep misgivings about executive power Mr Obama will leave the White House as one of the most prolific authors of major regulations in presidential hisryBlocked for most of his presidency  Congress Mr Obama has sought  act however he could In the process he created the kind of government neither he nor the Republicans wanted  one that depended on bureaucratic bulldozing rather than legislative transparency But once Mr Obama got the taste for it he pursued his executive power without apology and in ways that will shape the presidency for decades  comeThe Obama administration in its first seven years finalized 560 major regulations  those classified  the Congressional Budget Office as having particularly significant economic or social impacts That was nearly 50 percent more than the George W Bush administration during the comparable period according  data kept  the regulary studies center at George Washingn UniversityAn army of lawyers working under Mr Obamas authority has sought  restructure the nations health care and financial industries limit pollution bolster workplace protections and extend equal rights  minorities Under Mr Obama the government has literally placed a higher value on human lifeArticles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought  the nation and how the presidency has changed himArticles in this series will explore the sweeping change that President Obama has brought  the nation and how the presidency has changed himAnd it has imposed billions of dollars in new costs on businesses and consumersMany of the new rules are little known even as they affect the way Americans eat love and die People can dine on genetically engineered salmon Women can buy emergency contraceptive pills without prescriptions Military veterans can design their own headsnesThe administrations regulary legacy has become an issue in the campaign  replace Mr Obama as Donald J Trump has sharply criticized regulary overreach and promised  undo many of the new rules But executive power has expanded steadily under both Republican and Democratic presidents in recent decades and both Mr Trump and Hillary Clinn have promised  act in the service of their own goalsThe new rules built on the legislative vicries Mr Obama won during his first two years in office Those laws  the Affordable Care Act the DoddFrank Act and the 800 billion economic stimulus package  transformed the nations health care system curbed the ambitions of the big banks and injected financial support in a creaky economy But as Republicans increased their control of Capil Hill Mr Obamas deep frustration with congressional opposition led  a new approach He gradually embraced a presidents power  act unilaterallyHisry may now judge the regulations  be one of Mr Obamas most enduring legacies At the least his exercise of administrative power expanded and cemented a domestic legacy that now rivals Lyndon B Johnsons Great Society in reach and scopeIn May Mr Obama was asked  a farmer in Elkhart Ind  justify the dramatic increase in government regulations that affected his business Im not interested in regulating just for the sake of regulating Mr Obama responded But there are some things like making sure weve got clean air and clean water making sure that folks have health insurance making sure that worker safety is a priority  that I do think is part of our overall obligationInfuriated Republicans describe many of the new rules as unwarranted resulting in less jobs less businesses less prosperity lower takehome pay in the words of the House speaker Paul D Ryan Business groups also incensed have challenged a number of new regulations in court delaying them or preventing them from taking effect Some economic experts worry that the accumulation of regulation is contributing  the economys persistent sluggishnessThe big issue that I grapple with is that the regulary state keeps growing said Robert Hahn an economist and a regulary expert at the Smith School at the University of Oxford And as it keeps growing when does it become o muchMr Obama entered office in January 2009 determined  make his mark  passing bold new laws not  tinkering with rules Rahm Emanuel his first chief of staff and other p aides mapped out an ambitious twoyear agenda that included a health care overhaul new banking laws a remake of the federal student loan program infrastructure spending and stricter limits on pollutionThe president is not somebody who is intuitively or inherently a regular said Howard Shelanski who followed Mr Sunstein in that role in mid2013 He said Mr Obama conveyed a simple message If we can get a good result without regulating lets do thatBut after eight years of a Republican administration many Democrats were eager for the government  lean more forcefully on the levers of regulary power and officials within the federal bureaucracy felt emboldenedThe White House did resist some ideas It shut down efforts  Lisa Jackson Mr Obamas first administrar of the Environmental Protection Agency  increase the regulation of ozone a decision that environmentalists viewed as a betrayalBut other rules were allowed  proceed Kate Hanni an advocate from Napa Calif for the rights of airline passengers had tried for years  persuade the government  address a series of incidents in which flight delays left passengers trapped for hours on planes that had already left the gate often in cabins with stinking ilets weak airconditioning and no food The Bush administration put Ms Hanni on a task force consisting mostly of airline executives which concluded in the fall of 2008  over her forceful and repeated objections  that the public was best served  allowing the airlines  make their own decisionsWeeks after the task force released its report Ms Hanni was invited  Washingn in December 2008  meet with Robert S Rivkin the head of Mr Obamas transportation transition team Democrats in Congress had introduced legislation  address the issue but Mr Rivkin asked Ms Hanni if she would support new regulations instead She would back anything enforceable Ms Hanni saidRight answer he repliedOver the course of the next nine months Mr Rivkin and his team of career regulars at the Department of Transportation developed rules prohibiting planes loaded with passengers from sitting on the tarmac for more than three hoursIn meetings with Ray LaHood Mr Obamas first transportation secretary and his staff airline representatives argued for flexibility saying rigid timelines would only increase flight cancellations They chafed at the regulars willingness  see the benefits but not the costsSharon L Pinkern an executive at Airlines for America the industrys main trade group recalled Transportation Department regulars suggesting that unquantifiable unidentifiable benefits would outweigh the costs of new rules for the airlinesWhat are we supposed  do with that she asked later in an interviewBut Mr LaHood had himself experienced long waits on the runway during frequent trips home  Illinois Just days before Christmas in 2009 he announced a Passenger Bill of Rights which for the first time levied fines of up  27500 per passenger on airlines that leave domestic flights stranded for more than three hours He challenged the major carriers  provide their service in a way that is halfway convenient for their cusmersHis department Mr LaHood said in a recent interview had a new sense of purpose independent of any specific directive from the White HouseThey had other fish  fry Mr LaHood said of senior officials at the White House We didnt want  wait around for Congress  take five 10 years  do this We could do this  rule and regulation so we were pretty much off  the racesOther agencies were moving o In its second year bureaucrats working across the government completed 96 major rules more than in any subsequent yearThe White House soon began  take a greater interest in regulationPassing legislation  address the problem was unlikely Mr Emanuel knew given entrenched ideological opposition and the White Houses focus on overhauling the health insurance system But NancyAnn DeParle direcr of the newly created Office of Health Reform suggested an alternative The administration had the power  impose conditions on hospitals that got federal Medicare fundingA year later the president directed the Department of Health and Human Services  develop regulations requiring hospitals  extend visitation rights  samesex partnersA focus on similar issues produced more than 100 executive actions and regulary changes intended  improve the lives of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people particularly after the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down the federal law that defined marriage as between a man and a womanPeople with HIV were no longer barred from entry in the country federal housing rules recognized lesbian gay bisexual and transgender families health insurance companies were barred from discriminating against gay people labor protections applied  gay couples married samesex couples could take family and medical leave and the Internal Revenue Service started treating samesex couples no differentlyThese are really lasting things said David Stacy the government affairs direcr for the Human Rights Campaign a gay rights advocacy organization They affect people in their everyday livesAs the Obama administration turned ward regulation it sought  strengthen its hand  changing the estimates of what a life is worth Those estimates allowed the administration  argue that the benefits of many regulations were greater than previously appreciated This push was particularly important as a justification for stronger environmental protectionsA White House push  pass a sweeping climate change bill in 2009 failed  pass in Congress but almost from the outset some of Mr Obamas aides were working on a Plan B Mr Sunstein and Michael Greensne the first chief economist of Mr Obamas Council of Economic Advisers created an internal task force  put a dollar figure on the cost of carbon emissionsThe government does not try  quantify all the benefits of proposed regulations When it came  environmental regulations the calculation was particularly limited Analysts often assigned a dollar figure  just one kind of damage  emissions of small particles  and then stacked up the costs of the proposal against the benefits of fewer particlesThe Obama White House has issued hundreds of major regulations in an effort  reshape aspects of American lifeQuantifying a second kind of damage from carbon emissions would broaden the assessed benefits of new regulations  potentially justifying new and stronger restrictions In 2010 the administration issued a report that estimated the economic impact of global warming including agricultural disruptions increased flooding and health problems It pegged the cost of carbon emissions at 21 per n An updated assessment in 2013 raised the price tag  33When the administration announced stricter standards for aumobile fuel efficiency in 2011 it cited the reduction in carbon emissions as a key benefit Those benefits have since been cited in several dozen new regulations including the hotly debated 2015 rule seeking  restrict emissions from new power plantsRegulars also revisited a more fundamental

estimated value of preventing one death from 66 million in 2009  94 million last year adjusting for inflation The department made an even larger adjustment for preventing injuries for example raising the value of averting a broken arm from 103000 in 2009  442000 in 2015 also adjusting for inflation The increases have helped  justify new requirements for stronger roofs and rearview cameras on aumobiles and seatbelts on busesThe new carbon cost estimate in particular has drawn fire from industry groups who regard it as an arbitrary assessment intended  further an environmental agendaMr Greensne in a recent interview defended the governments number as a result of a technocratic process that was not influenced  political pressuresOur job as faceless bureaucrats sitting in windowless rooms was not  do science but  summarize the frontier of science he said  And I feel that we were faithful  thatBy the fall of 2011 after a summer standoff between the two political parties nearly caused a government shutdown it was clear  Mr Obama that little hope remained for moving his agenda forward in a Congress controlled  RepublicansSpeaking in Las Vegas that Ocber Mr Obama expressed disdain for an increasingly dysfunctional Congress and pledged Where they wont act I willThat sentiment kicked off a slowmoving realignment as White House officials held a series of strategy meetings that fall in the Roosevelt Room first with Mr Obama on Saturdays and later with agency and policy experts usually on Tuesdays and Fridays Led  Ms DeParle who had become deputy chief of staff and Dan Pfeiffer the communications direcr they asked What can we do without CongressIts certainly true that we learned  about the third year that the answer  every challenge isnt going  be legislative said Cecilia Muoz now direcr of Mr Obamas Domestic Policy CouncilThe pace of regulation stalled somewhat in 2012 amid political concerns about announcing sweeping new regulations during the campaign In 2013 Mr Obamas team briefly hoped his vicry would lead  legislative progress but Republicans blocked gun control measures and an immigration overhaul and partisan gridlock shut the government down for 15 days that OcberIn early 2014 the moment was finally ripe Mr Obama recruited John D Podesta then the head of the Center for American Progress a liberal research and policy institution  be his counselor in the White HouseThe weight if you will changed with a very recalcitrant Republican House and with both the House and the Senate being part of the Nyet caucus Mr Podesta said It meant that you had  be seriously concerned with trying  make change happen with the ols that you had availableIn January 2014 a frustrated president sod before Congress and declared a year of action  with or without the help of the Republicans arrayed before himWhenever I can take steps without legislation  expand opportunity for more American families thats what Im going  do Mr Obama said in his State of the Union addressMr Obama announced an executive order raising the minimum wage  1010 an hour for several hundred thousand cooks janirs and other federal contract workers In subsequent orders each resulting in a new regulation the president required contracrs  let their workers take paid sick days and banned discrimination against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender workers He also increased workplace protections for all workers at businesses that held federal contracts  an umbrella covering roughly 29 million workersWhat the president was ultimately doing was holding up the United States government as a model employer said Joseph Geevarghese direcr of od Jobs Nation a unionbacked advocacy group that pressed the administration  embrace its regulary power And it created a ripple effect Within months of the president acting you had private CEOs  Ikea Gap Disney airlines  saying they o were going  boost minimum payThe new regulations again required the White House  broaden its assessment of regulary benefits During Mr Obamas first term administration officials ld Mr Geevarghese and other activists that the government did not have the power  make such changes But after Mr Obamas reelection they found a way White House lawyers concluded that the president could impose requirements on contracrs in the interest of taxpayersBetsey Stevenson a member of the presidents Council of Economic Advisers ok the lead in building a case that contracrs who paid higher wages would attract and retain better workers increasing their productivityThe theory holds for example that if the lunch lines at a federal office building moved a little more quickly because of more competent motivated cafeteria workers every employee in those lines would save a few minutes a day and have more time  work thus increasing productivityThe idea has its roots in work  George Akerlof a Nobel Prizewinning economist and his wife Janet Yellen now chairwoman of the Federal Reserve who decided in the early 1980s  pay their basitter abovemarket wages as motivationWith the presidents blessing the EPA also became more aggressive The agency asserted federal authority  protect thousands of waterways and wetlands proposed  cap carbon emissions at new and existing power plants raised emissions standards for trucks and airplanes and called for new limits on methane mercury and ozoneHe has been much more ambitious and aggressive on environmental regulation than any other president weve had said Jeffrey Holmstead a lawyer pursuing legal challenges  some of Mr Obamas signature environmental rulesCourts have now temporarily blocked the administrations water rules and delayed the power plant limits on carbon dioxide emissions The next administration will also have considerable leeway  determine how quickly new rules are carried out and how strictly enforcedEvery president promises  prune the federal rule bookMr Obama has tried  formalize the process for reviewing existing regulations and the two candidates vying  take his place Hillary Clinn and Donald J Trump have nodded at the need  ease the burdens of regulationBut the scope of federal regulation has continued  grow and the trend is likely  continue Presidents both Democratic and Republican have asserted greater power in recent decades  dictate the shape of regulations while Congress has become less specific in its instructionsWe live in an era of presidential administration Elena Kagan a Harvard law professor since appointed  Mr Obama  the Supreme Court wrote in a 2001 paper that reviewed the expansion of the regulary stateBoth Mrs Clinn and Mr Trump would most likely face significant congressional opposition  their major campaign promises To sidestep Congress they now have the legacy of Mr Obama Mr Podesta now Mrs Clinns campaign chairman said the appeal of taking action without Congress is hard  resistYou come in with a strategy of going  the Hill certainly where you can find some cooperation Mr Podesta said But when that fails writing regulations is a way  get much more substantial throwweight behind solving the problemAn earlier version of this article misstated

Just how securely are banks moving money around the worldNew details emerged on Friday about a pair of related attacks on banks that use the Swift message service which allows financial firms and companies  transfer payments around the worldComputer security researchers briefed on the investigation in one of the attacks on the Bangladesh Bank raised several theories about the crime including the possibility that groups from Pakistan and North Korea may have been spying on the bank Other analysts investigating the attacks said there were striking similarities between the multiple bespoke ols used  the hackers in both the banking cases and the attack on Sony Pictures in 2014That attack and the 81 million heist from the Bangladesh central bank account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February are thought  be part of a broad assault on the global banking system  thieves whose operating methods and digital fingerprints are being studied carefully  analysts worldwideIn both attacks on banks the intruders obtained legitimate credentials  sign in  the Swift network They initiated fraudulent money transfers then covered their tracks using tailormade malwareSwift an acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication is a global banking consortium that operates a secure and trusted network that sends payment instructions between banks across international borders In the predictable fingerpointing that has followed the news of the attacks Swift has pointed out that its core network was not hacked  just the end points at which the banks tap in it  and the New York Fed has reiterated that it followed all proper proceduresOn Friday Representative Carolyn B Maloney Democrat of New York released a statement calling on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York  bolster its security even furtherI remain concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system Ms Maloney said in a statementShe also released correspondence between her office and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in which the banks general counsel Thomas C Baxter Jr assured her that there is no evidence that any Federal Reserve systems were compromisedInvestigars briefed on the investigation at the Bangladesh central bank say that they had uncovered the presence of three groups of intruders inside the banks systems two nations  Pakistan and North Korea  and a third unidentified group of digital criminals thought  have siphoned the funds from the bank  accounts in the PhilippinesAlso on Friday two forensics investigars at BAE Systems outlined evidence that suggested similarities between the Bangladesh heist and a 2014 attack against Sony Pictures that law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the United States have traced  North Korea That year Sony released the farcical movie The Interview which poked fun at North KoreaThe investigars pointed  specialized identical ols  including identical encryption keys file names and a highly unusual data deletion technique  that were used in the attack on Sony Pictures the Bangladesh central bank and the Vietnamese bankHowever people briefed on the actual investigation at the Bangladesh bank who would speak only on the condition that they not be named said that while the same ols were present inside Bangladeshs systems suggesting any link between that heist and the North Korean hackers would be prematureBanks are frequent targets not just for profitseeking digital criminals but also nation states hoping  track spending  their perceived enemies or  gain insights in dealmaking activityIn 2012 investigars at the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab revealed a campaign  nations presumably the United States or Israel aimed at banks in Lebanon including the Bank of Beirut Blom Bank Byblos Bank and Credit Libanais along with Citibank and PayPalIn that case the organizations involved in the Lebanese bank intrusions never sle any funds Rather they used slen credentials  track cusmers assets and spendingBy their nature hackers are difficult  trace and theories advanced immediately after a breach can turn out  be wrongIn summer 2014 when hackers sle account information from tens of millions of cusmers at JPMorgan Chase experts initially pointed  Russia raising concerns about national securityIn the end federal prosecurs said that attack might have been partly the work of Israeli nationals and individuals who knew each other from Florida State University and that their attack on the bank may have been aimed at advancing a pumpanddump sck scheme No money was slen from JPMorgan in that breachLarge banks in the United States and Europe which are part owners of Swift have been moniring the developments and are studying whether they need  adjust any of their defenses  guard against similar intrusionsWe are pretty fast learners said Doug Johnson senior vice president for payments and security at the American Bankers Association a trade group We proactively share information about how  mitigate these threatsIn the heist at Bangladesh Bank the thieves used the slen credentials  authorize the transfer of 951 million from the central banks account at the New York FedThe Fed approved five of the payments  accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines As far as the bank employees in the United States could tell the payment requests had been authenticated  SwiftOne of those five requests was ultimately blocked  a bank in Sri Lanka which noticed that the name of the supposed nonprofit group that was  receive the funds was misspelled Instead of Foundation it was spelled Fundation according  a person briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a continuing criminal investigationThe New York officials relied entirely on Swift  authenticate the transfers according  a letter from the New York Fed that Ms Maloneys office released on Friday It does not independently vet other users on the Swift networkThe New York Fed withheld an additional 30 requested transfers from Bangladesh because one address that was supposed  receive a payment contained the same name as a ship known for smuggling activity the person briefed on the matter saidIt turned out the address and the smuggling ship were unrelated but that was enough  raise the New York Feds concerns When they couldnt reconfirm with officials in Bangladesh that transfers were legitimate the New York bank denied themCollapse,banking

Greece has no good Plan B Its only rational course of action is  work with its eurozone credirs  reform its economySome of the subsequent rheric from Mr Tsiprass ministerial colleagues like the promises  cancel privatizations has been troubling So have decisions like raising the salaries of electricity workersYanis Varoufakis the finance minister has sent a rather thin list of proposed reforms  his eurozone counterparts in advance of a meeting on Monday He has also raised the possibility of holding a second election or a referendum if Greece meets with intransigence from its credirs But it is unclear whether such a possible appeal  the voters may be the precursor  further Uturns  the government or an exit from the euro or may have some other purpose Mr Varoufakis will have much explaining  doIf Greece is  secure a longterm pact with its credirs  the end of June Mr Tsipras will have  abandon most of his election promises Given the difficulties he is having in delivering on even the shortterm pact there is a temptation  cast around for alternativesSome members of Syriza want Greece  regain its financial independence  defaulting on its debts and cutting loose from the euro Pundits like Wolfgang Mnchau of The Financial Times want Greece  threaten  default while staying within the single currency  and  use that as a tactic  secure a better deal from its credirsMr Tsipras should resist those siren voices Their advice will lead  disaster as Odysseus the ancient Greek mythological hero knew well when he had himself tied  his ships mast so he could listen  the sirens but not do their biddingLook first at the option of default combined with exiting the euro This is superficially attractive because Greeces debt would be cut  more manageable levels and bringing back the drachma would allow the country  devalue its currency and strenghten its competitivenessThe snag is that the transition would be nightmarish It could be managed only  imposing severe capital controls until the new currency was introduced  a process that would take several months given the need  jump through political legal and logistical hoops Otherwise the Greek people would merely take their money out of the banks knowing that their euros would be replaced with devalued drachmasCapital controls were introduced in Cyprus two years ago when its banks were restructured and are only due  be lifted this month But if controls were imposed in Greece  coincide with a default the Cypriot ones would look like a walk in the parkPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersAfter all Nicosia didnt default on its debt and was working with its credirs ward a mutually acceptable solution As a result the European Central Bank flew in piles of cash people were allowed  take 300 euros a day out of their accounts and companies were able  pay for importsBy contrast Athens would have spped paying its credirs including not just other eurozone governments but also the ECB Its pie in the sky  suppose that in such circumstances Europes central bank would feed the cash machines or supply liquidity so businesses could bring in vital commodities like oil and medicines This would worsen the humanitarian crisis and possibly set off a new depressionIts not just that the transition  the drachma would be terrible The aftermath would also be appalling as taxes would have plummeted and the newly broke government would not be able  borrow abroadIn such circumstances a responsible government would tighten its belt cut spending and run a balanced budget But what chance is there of Syriza which was voted in on a promise  increase spending doing that Instead it might take the irresponsible option printing drachmas  fill the hole in its finances and so fuelling inflation and ultimately hyperinflationWhat then about the other supposed Plan B defaulting while staying in the euro That would be miserable oSuch a move would bankrupt the Greek banking system Because Athens would no longer be able  get funds from its eurozone partners  recapitalize the banks the only option would be  bail in deposirs  converting a portion of the money in their accounts in shares in the banks along the lines of what was done in Cyprus For the duration of such an operation capital controls would have  be introducedThe newly broke government meanwhile would have  balance its budget This would be hard given that the deposir bailin plus capital controls would deaden economic activityThe state might therefore be tempted  pay salaries pensions and other obligations with IOUs This would be extremely unpopular because the recipients would view them as worth a fraction of real euros The IOUs would start  circulate as a parallel currency trading at a discount  euros and seen as the probable precursor  the reintroduction of

Squeezed  hisrically low interest rates a wide range of invesrs  from retirees living on fixed incomes  huge endowments and pension funds trying  meet budgets  are trying  figure out how  generate incomeWhere is someone supposed  get yield these days said Emma B Rasiel an associate professor of economics Thats what got us thinkingIts a pressing question for nearly every invesr and has left even professional financial advisers scratching their heads The United States is now in the fifth year of a low interest rate environment Tenyear Treasuries the benchmark United States interest rate yielded 5 percent in July 2007 just before the recession began This week the rate was below 2 percent and last July 10year rates were the lowest ever recorded This week the onemonth Treasury bill the lowestrisk bond investment because of its short duration was yielding practically nothing 004 percentFor many years the rule of thumb for most longterm invesrs was 6040 a 60 percent allocation  scks and 40 percent  bonds Besides having the virtue of simplicity less volatile and lowerreturn bonds were meant  smooth out the ups and downs of the riskier sck market while giving invesrs some of the greater possible gains of scks Vanguard estimates that an invesr with a 6040 allocation can expect an average annual return of 86 percent based on data going back  1926 That allocation resulted in a decline in 21 of the next 86 years In the worst year 1931 it resulted in a drop of 266 percent while in the best year 1933 it produced a gain of 367 percentBy comparison a 100 percent allocation  scks produced an average annual gain of 99 percent with a decline in 25 of the 86 years and much greater volatility A 100 percent allocation  bonds resulted in an average gain of 56 percent with a decline in just 13 of the 86 yearsHardly anyone expects those high bond returns now Despite the paltry yields fixedincome invesrs have been cushioned for the last few years  falling interest rates which allowed the value of their bonds  increase as yields declined Bond prices move inversely  interest rates But with shortterm rates now near zero and longerterm rates still at hisrical lows its almost impossible for rates  decline any further Indeed they have been creeping up in recent months And if and when rates rise more substantially bond invesrs will be stuck with not only slim yields but also losses on their principalGiven this should invesrs abandon the triedandtrue 6040 approach and move more aggressively in scksThe traditional 6040 approach  building a portfolio is on the way out said Michael Fredericks head of retail asset allocation for BlackRock and lead portfolio manager for the BlackRock MultiAsset Income Fund It is being replaced he said  tactical asset allocation a strategy in which invesrs change their allocation based on the current pricing of asset classesIf bonds are overpriced as many now believe and scks are underpriced at least relative  other assets then the allocation should shift ward scks Were not telling clients  sell all their bonds Mr Fredericks said They do balance out the riskier assets in a portfolio But most invesrs need  consider putting more in scksIn his own MultiAsset Income Fund which has traditionally focused on fixedincome assets Mr Fredericks said he had reduced the amount invested in highyield bonds and moved in scks that pay high dividends using an options strategy  lock in gains and protect against market drops The fund had more than 25 percent of its assets in equities at the end of the year with the remainder in various forms of fixed income Last year it returned just over 13 percentFor the Duke contest the students were asked  design a portfolio for an invesr who was expecting  retire or begin withdrawing assets around 2020 just seven years away That time frame ordinarily calls for a conservative  that is bond and cashoriented  allocation  minimize volatility and the potential for loss A traditional rule of thumb for older invesrs is that the percentage of assets in bonds should equal their age So 70yearolds should have 70 percent of their assets in bondsPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the

teammates  Yuefeng Du and Yuci Zhang  faced the same quandary as most invesrs how  generate income while minimizing risk and preserving assets for retirement They examined model portfolios from Fidelity Vanguard and BlackRock We looked at hisrical returns for each asset class and then adjusted those for current market conditions Mr Kim saidAs the members of the team formulated their strategy last fall they shared the concerns of many experts that bonds were overvalued But they saw little risk in the short term  principal given the Federal Reserves public commitment  keep interest rates low until the economy improves At the same time they worried that the Feds easy money policy would lead  inflation which has traditionally eroded fixedincome returnsThe teams contest entry called for allocating 43 percent  United States scks  303 percent  a Russell 2000 index fund and 127 percent  a Russell 2000 fund that invests in midsize companies They made no allocation  international scks Like more traditional models they maintained a large allocation  fixed income but weighted it heavily ward Treasury inflationprotected securities or TIPS whose yields rise with inflation They allocated 321 percent  TIPS and 249 percent  an aggregate bond fundThe result was a 97 percent projected annual return with less volatility than the model funds they examined The team ran projected returns for cases including both bull and bear markets and their allocation outperformed the BlackRock model in all scenarios Mr Kim saidProfessor Rasiel winnowed the field of more than 30 entrants  10 finalists who presented their strategies  BlackRock executives in late November The executives announced the winner a few weeks later Mr Kims team BlackRock praised the teams research its modeling in bull and bear market assumptions and its strong understanding of macroeconomic driversThe prize was an interview and a shot at an internship at BlackRock this summer Mr Kim is waiting  hear if he got one and said he was aiming for a career in investment bankingThe runnerup team embraced a similar strategy  Mr Kims team but was even more concerned about inflation It put 682 percent of its assets in TIPS It was also bullish on riskier equities from emerging markets with a 16 percent allocation The remainder was in United States equities The projected annualized rate of return was 10 percent with slightly lower projected volatility than the winning entryBefore invesrs rush  replicate either approach in their own portfolios they might want  consider that these are college undergraduates however talented and motivated they may be Its much o early  assess the winning teams results but so far they have been right about United States scks the market has rallied strongly since they made their submissionBut projections and models are only as good as the underlying assumptions Given the heavy allocation  currently lowyielding TIPS the students are likely  outperform more traditional portfolios only if inflation picks up in the next seven years Mr Kim conceded that his teams projected return for TIPS 566 percent and bonds 591 percent may be optimistic given current market conditionsFinancial advisers stress that all asset allocation plans need  be tailored  each invesrs circumstances and risk lerance Faced with the same low interest rate environment professional asset allocars with the same time horizon as the Duke contestants have emphasized scks over bondsThe Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund for example had almost 56 percent of its assets in scks at the end of last year including more than 15 percent in international equities Only 8 percent was in TIPS Vanguards Target Retirement 2020 Fund was even more weighted ward scks with an allocation of just under 64 percent nearly 20 percent of which was in international equitiesAfter all the models and projections theyve ended up pretty close  the old 6040 approachSee More,banking

By November with Apple sck in the midst of a precipius decline they were still bullish Fifty of 57 analysts rated it a buy or strong buy only two rated it a sell Apple shares continued their plunge and this week were trading at just over 450 down 36 percent from their peakHow could professional analysts have gotten it so wrongIt wasnt supposed  be this way A decade ago Congressional hearings and an investigation  Eliot Spitzer then the New York atrney general exposed a maze of conflicts of interest afflicting Wall Street research There were some norious examples of analysts who curried favor with investment banking clients and potential clients  producing favorable research and then were paid huge bonuses out of investment banking fees Many invesrs and regulars blamed analysts overly bullish forecasts for helping  inflate the dotcom bubble that burst in 2000After a global settlement of Mr Spitzers investigation  major investment banks and the SarbanesOxley reform legislation in 2002 investment banking and research operations were segregated Conflicts had  be disclosed and research and analyst pay was detached from investment banking revenues among other measuresThese reforms seem  have worked  but only up  a point Other conflicts have come  the fore especially at large brokerage firms and investment banks And studies have shown that analysts are prone  other influences  like following the herd  that can undermine their judgments The reforms didnt necessarily make analysts better at their jobs said Stuart C Gilson a professor of finance at Harvard Business SchoolIt may be no coincidence that the only analyst who even came close  calling the peak in Apples sck runs his own firm and is compensated based on the accuracy of his calls Carlo R Besenius founder and chief executive of Creative Global Investments downgraded Apple  sell last Oct 3 with shares trading at 685 In December he lowered his price target  420 and this week he ld me he may drop it even further  320Mr Besenius founded his firm a decade ago after spending many years in research at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers I saw so many conflicts of interest in trading investment banking and research so I started a conflictfree company he said this week from Luxembourg where he was born and now lives Wall Street is full of conflicts It still is and always will be Its incompetent at picking scksSince the passage of SarbanesOxley several studies have documented a decline in the percentage of analysts buy recommendations albeit a modest one while sell recommendations have increased Before 2002 analyst recommendations were tilted ward optimistic at an extreme rate Ohad Kadan a professor of finance at Washingn University in St Louis and coauthor of one of the studies ld me this week Thats still true day but its not as extreme Its a little more balancedWhile investment banking conflicts have been addressed the most obvious conflict now is that research is funded through the trading desks Professor Gilson said If youre an analyst and one way your report brings in revenue is through increased trading a buy recommendation will do this more than a sell For a sell you have  already own the sck  generate a trade But anybody can potentially buy a sck Thats one hypothesis about why you still see a disproportionate number of buy recommendations That may be especially true for heavily traded scks like Apple which generate huge commissions for Wall StreetBut no one thinks conflicts alone can explain the analysts asmal recent Apple performance Theres o much unanimity Bruce Greenwald a professor of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School and a renowned value invesr ld me this week Thats whats so troubling When that many analysts are in agreement they cant all be conflictedHe and other experts say there are additional documented facrs that help explain why Wall Street analysts are so often wrong they extrapolate from recent performance data they chase momentum they want  please their cusmers and they show a tendency ward herd behavior Which is  say they fall in the same pitfalls that afflict most invesrsWhy arent they more sophisticated Youd hope they would be Professor Kadan said But they always fall in the same trapsPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersProfessor Greenwald agreed When something goes up they all put out buy recommendations Their models extrapolate past performance in the future They chase momentum With Apple they were right at 600 and they were right at 650 which reinforced the trend So why would they be wrong at 700Professor Kadan said that momentum investing has its adherents and is often right at least in the short term that many invesrs focus on Youd hope that analysts of all people would be able  anticipate an abrupt reversal but theyre not very good at it They loved Apple at 700 Im sure they were trying  do their best but theyre prisoners of momentumAnother facr is that analysts have a tendency  tell their audience what it wants  hear The analysts are in the end sales people Professor Greenwald said Their credibility depends on their not upsetting their invesrs o much Everybody loved Apple everybody did well The bears were always wrong It ok an enormous amount of courage  fight the tideProfessor Kadan agreed Analysts tend  herd Theres no big penalty if youre wrong because everyone else is wrong Youve got cover Youre not going  lose your job If you take a different opinion either you get a big prize if youre right or you lose your job An analyst needs  be really courageous  say something different from most other analystsMr Besenius the one analyst who downgraded Apple near its peak said Im not afraid  make big controversial calls but attributed his decision less  courage than  survival Im paid based on performance he said I have  go  my clients and explain why they should pay for my research when they can get it for nothing from the firms where they pay their trading commissionsMr Besenius based his recommendation on technical facrs  as Apple hit 700 its upward momentum and trading volume were slowing  as well as more fundamental concerns about product quality and innovation as well as growing competition from rivals like Samsung And there were more subjective facrs Mr Besenius said he became uncomfortable with what he deemed Apples arrogance I loved Steve Jobs he said He built a great company But he was one of the most arrogant CEOs Ive ever met The way he introduced new products was one big display of arrogance He ridiculed Microsoft as Micro who Thats a good reason  be cautious A little humility is a good thing An Apple spokesman declined  comment on Mr Beseniuss observationsIt galls Mr Besenius that market regulars dont measure the performance of Wall Streets research recommendations and he said he believed that they should require firms  disclose the track records of scks their analysts recommend Theyre not being held accountable for bad recommendations he maintained Little firms like ours have  be better than the big firms We have  prove we can add value Otherwise we wouldnt have an existenceApple is only one prominent example of egg on analysts faces and bullish Wall Street analysts were right for years  until they were wrong Even day analysts remain overwhelmingly positive about Apple This week 44 analysts rated it a strong buy or buy although 10 now rate it a hold according  Thomson ReutersShould anyone listenMany brokers still rely on their analysts research and offer the analysts reports  clients for guidance in picking scks  buy and sell But the Securities and Exchange Commission takes a skeptical approach Despite the reforms it helped put in place it warns on its Web site of continuing conflicts of interest and says flatly As a general matter invesrs should not rely solely on an analysts recommendation when deciding whether  buy hold or sell a sck It notes that many brokers arent allowed  contradict recommendations from their own research departmentsProfessor Gilson of Harvard said Analysts are like movie critics Some are good and some are bad I find some of them extraordinarily useful I advise my students  look  them but you have

WASHINGTON  When the Obama administration imposed sanctions on individual Russians last month in response  Moscows armed intervention in Ukraine one of the targets was a longtime parwner of a commodities trading company called the Gunvor GroupHis name Gennady N Timchenko meant little  most Americans but buried in the Treasury Department announcement were a dozen words that President Obama and his team knew would not escape the attention of Russias president Vladimir V Putin Putin the statement said has investments in Gunvor and may have access  Gunvor fundsFor years the suspicion that Mr Putin has a secret fortune has intrigued scholars industry analysts opposition figures journalists and intelligence agencies but defied their efforts  uncover it Numbers are thrown around suggesting that Mr Putin may control 40 billion or even 70 billion in theory making him the richest head of state in world hisryFor all the rumors and speculation though there has been little if any hard evidence and Gunvor has adamantly denied any financial ties  Mr Putin and repeated that denial on FridayBut Mr Obamas response  the Ukraine crisis while derided  critics as slow and weak has reinvigorated a 15year global hunt for Mr Putins hidden wealthNow as the Obama administration prepares  announce another round of sanctions as early as Monday targeting Russians it considers part of Mr Putins financial circle it is sending a notverysubtle message that it thinks it knows where the Russian leader has his money and that he could ultimately be targeted directly or indirectlyIts something that could be done that would send a very clear signal of taking the gloves off and not just dance around it said Juan C Zarate a White House counterterrorism adviser  President George W Bush who helped pioneer the governments modern financial campaign techniques  choke off terrorist moneySo far the American government has not imposed sanctions on Mr Putin himself and officials said they would not in the short term reasoning that personally targeting a head of state would amount  a nuclear escalation as several put itAmong those likely  be on Mondays list officials said are Igor Sechin president of the Rosneft state oil company and Aleksei Miller head of the Gazprom state energy giantIts like standing in a circle and all of a sudden everyone in the circle is getting a bomb thrown on them and you get the message that its getting close said Senar Robert Menendez Democrat of New Jersey the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee describing at a recent hearing the way the sanctions are getting closer  Mr PutinPutins DenialsMr Putins reported income for 2013 was just 102000 according  a Kremlin statement this month Over the years he has crudely dismissed suggestions of personal wealth I have seen some papers about this he said at a news conference in 2008 Just gossip thats not worth discussing Its simply rubbish They picked everything out of someones nose and smeared it on their little papersHow much Mr Putin cares about money has long been a subject of debate both in Russia and in the West On government payrolls since his days in the KGB the Soviet intelligence agency Mr Putin  many seemed driven more  power and nationalism than  material gain With access  government perks like palaces planes and luxury cars he seemingly has little need for personal wealthIf he really does have all that money salted away somewhere why asked Bruce K Misamore who was the chief financial officer of Yukos Oil before the Russian government imprisoned its p shareholder Mikhail B Khodorkovsky seized its assets and gave many of them  Mr Sechins Rosneft What good does it do him Is it just ego Presumably its not  pass it down  heirs I doubt well see Mr Putin becoming one of the leading philanthropists in the worldAnd yet some have drawn attention  what appear  be expensive watches on his wrist and the construction of a seaside palace that the Kremlin denied was being built for Mr Putin Some argue that Mr Putin may want money or the appearance of it because it is the measure of stature and power in a society whose transition  capitalism has produced instant billionaires out of the wreckage of CommunismI came  the conclusion after time that some of these reports may be seeded  people around Putin himself said Fiona Hill who was the chief Russia expert at the National Intelligence Council and last year cowrote a book about Mr Putin Russians have  have the biggest and the best Its part of the mystique part of the imageThe Treasury Department has not provided evidence  back up its statement about Mr Putin but standard policy requires it  have enough verification  withstand a court challenge Gunvor a Swissbased firm that is the worlds fourthlargest oil trader and generated 91 billion in revenue last year said it had subsequently provided documents  the Treasury Department that it said disproved any connection  Mr PutinSome Obama administration officials have argued for releasing details of what the United States knows about Mr Putins wealth  expose him  the Russian public a suggestion so far resisted  the White House Some lawmakers in Congress are discussing legislation  require the administration  publish an estimate of Mr Putins overall worthAmerican diplomatic cables obtained  the antisecrecy organization WikiLeaks show sustained attention  the subject The cables tied Mr Putin not only  Gunvor but also  Surgutneftegaz a large oil company and even  Gazprom but they used words like rumored In one cable for instance diplomats cited a General Electric executive working in the region who privately said that Mr Yakunin the president of the stateowned Russian Railways has made sizable cash payments  Putin and estimated that the Russian leader was worth well over 10 billionThe CIA in 2007 produced a secret assessment of Mr Putins wealth that has never been released according  officials who have read it The assessment the officials said largely tracked with assertions later made publicly  a Russian political analyst who said Mr Putin effectively controlled holdings in Gunvor Gazprom and Surgutneftegaz that added up  about 40 billion at the timeTrailed  SuspicionFrom the start of his political career Mr Putin has been dogged  suspicion While he was deputy mayor of St Petersburg in the 1990s his office signed deals giving favored companies licenses  export 92 million in oil timber metal and other products in exchange for an equal amount of imported food But the food never materializedMr Putin was not accused of personally benefiting but a City Council committee led  Marina Salye recommended Mr Putins dismissal for incompetence and unprecedented negligence and irresponsibility She also pushed for prosecurs  investigate Mr Putin blamed the companies involved and was spared  the mayor Analy A Sobchak his political patronStill it was not clear whether Mr Putin in that era coveted money for himself or was more interested in deciding how it would be distributed as state assets were gobbled up  newly minted capitalists Boris A Berezovsky the tycoon who helped install Mr Putin in the Kremlin only  fall out with him and become his most bitter opponent ld a sry of seeking and receiving Mr Putins help with a business venture in St Petersburg and then offering him a bribe in thanks only  be turned downFor the United States seeking intelligence on Russia became a lower priority after the attacks of Sept 11 2001 But Washingn got a rare look in the world of money and the Kremlin after the invasion of Iraq in 2003 Charles A Duelfer the weapons inspecr uncovered a web of lucrative Iraqi oil vouchers given  close Putin associates including his chief of staff and the presidential office itself in hope of eroding support for international sanctionsIn a later book Mr Duelfer wrote that Colin L Powell then the secretary of state objected  mentioning Mr Putin for diplomatic reasons By listing a Russian state company under Mr Putins control Mr Powell said you are implicating Putin Mr Duelfer said he reluctantly ok Mr Putins name out of the report Mr Powell said last week that he did not recall the episodeIn 2006 Mr Bush kicked off an initiative targeting corrupt foreign leaders Over the next year his administration focused attention on learning more about the finances of leaders in the former Soviet Union like Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Aleksandr G Lukashenko of BelarusThe 2007 CIA assessment grew out of that But different officials came away with different impressions of its reliability Some said they considered it a reasonable appraisal of Mr Putins worth based on solid reporting Others said they considered it  be built largely on speculation and unsubstantiated talkEither way the assessment roughly mirrored estimates made publicly at the end of that year  Stanislav Belkovsky a Russian political analyst with ties  the Kremlin whose public attack on oligarchs several years earlier had presaged the arrest and prosecution of Mr Khodorkovsky of YukosMr Belkovsky ld European newspapers in December 2007 that Mr Putin had amassed a fortune of at least 40 billion through sizable shares of some of Russias largest energy companies Mr Putin secretly controlled at least 75 percent of Gunvor 45 percent of Gazprom and 37 percent of Surgutneftegaz Mr Belkovsky said citing only unnamed Kremlin insidersThe reality is that Putin has others and entities  move money that he controls or that he might control ultimately said Mr Zarate the former Bush adviser The challenge with him is you dont have an easy way of drawing the line  the assets he actually owns and controls currently Theres a dimension of layering and relationships with people with whom hes close and entities that serve as conduits that make it tricky  determine what is Putins and what is notEfforts  Open CurtainIn the years since others have taken a look at Mr Putins finances The magazine The Economist linked Mr Putin  Mr Timchenko in 2008 Mr Timchenko sued but later dropped the case and The Economist issued a statement We accept Gunvors assurances that neither Vladimir Putin nor any other senior Russian political figures have any ownership in Gunvor the magazine saidIn 2010 Sergei Kolesnikov a businessman published an open letter saying he had helped Mr Putin secretly build a billiondollar palace on the Black Sea The Kremlin dismissed his claims as absurd In 2012 Boris Y Nemtsov an opposition leader released a report detailing the presidential perks at Mr Putins disposal including 20 residences 15 helicopters four yachts and 43 aircraftBut some hunting for Mr Putins private wealth have found obstacles Last month Cambridge University Press declined  publish a book  its longtime author Karen Dawisha a Miami University professor exploring how Mr Putin built a klepcratic and authoritarian regime in Russia The publisher wrote her saying it had no reason  doubt the veracity of her book but deemed the risk of a lawsuit o high according  letters published  The Economist In a return letter Ms Dawisha called the decision preemptive book burningAll of which makes the Treasury Departments assertions last month so striking In addition  targeting Mr Timchenko one of the founders of Gunvor the department froze any American assets of Mr Kovalchuk and his Bank Rossiya It described Rossiya as the personal bank for senior officials and described Mr Kovalchuk as one of Mr Putins cashiersMr Timchenko denied the assertions and sold his 43 percent share in Gunvor  his partner Torbjorn Tornqvist the day before the sanctions were issued  avoid repercussions  the firm The sale contract has no conditions or provisions for buying the shares back and Mr Tornqvist now holds 87 percent of the company while senior employees own the rest the company saidSeth Thomas Pietras Gunvors corporate affairs direcr said Mr Putin does not and never has had any ownership direct indirect or otherwise in Gunvor nor is he a beneficiary of Gunvor and he has no access  Gunvors funds After the sanctions statement Gunvor executives flew  Washingn  meet with State Department officials and congressional aides Were providing evidence but have not seen any sort of evidence from them yet and dont know if we ever will Mr Pietras said He said the companys banking partners had been satisfied  its explanationsThe Treasury Department however was not We remain confident that the information on the relationship between Putin and Gunvor is accurate said a Treasury official who asked not  be identified in a public dispute with the companyGarry Kasparov the Russian chess master turned opposition leader said Mr Putins wealth must be so buried that it would be difficult  prove within the standards typically required  American lawyers Im sure its reachable but you might have  break some of the rules  reach it he said The sanctions issued so far

For decades General Electric was happy  reap the enormous profits that arose from its finance arm as it swelled in one of the countrys biggest lendersBut as banking has become a less profitable and riskier business GE will complete a transformation it began amid the tumult of the financial crisis selling off most of that division over the next two yearsBeginning  selling 265 billion worth of real estate assets GE is hastening  return  its roots as one of the mightiest industrial companies in the world whose operations include jet engines oil drilling equipment and medical devices What it will mostly shed is GE Capital a lender with hundreds of billions of dollars worth of assetsThe move announced Friday reflects the shifting landscape of the financial world especially for the largest players They face greater regulary scrutiny and calls from analysts and invesrs  slim their operations or break up Some are shifting their focus  areas like wealth management as traditional activities like trading prove less profitable It is no surprise that GE decided  reevaluate its role in this ecosystemThe divestiture campaign codenamed Hubble within GE and put gether in about six weeks will erase one of the main legacies of the conglomerates vaunted former chief executive John F Welch Jr But it is also a recognition that manufacturing not finance represents the companys futureWere not sentimentalists Jeffrey R Immelt the multinationals current chairman and chief executive said in an interviewGEs expansive campaign will bring other changes as well In shrinking its farflung empire the company will also bring back 36 billion in cash that now resides overseas taking a 6 billion tax hit in the process And it will also press  relieve itself from the burdens of being considered a obigfail lender a status that brings stricter regulary requirementsThe wide range of asset sales will help finance a huge return of money  shareholders which GE estimates will eventually reach 90 billion About 50 billion will come from a sck repurchase one of the biggest on recordJeffrey Immelt will have truly remade the company said Steven Winoker an analyst at Bernstein Research This is a massive strategic reallocation of capital and investmentGEs moves Mr Winoker said are likely  quiet rumblings from some invesrs and analysts that Mr Immelt should step down and give him time  execute the plan which runs through 2018Shareholders applauded the announcement pushing shares in GE up nearly 11 percent on Friday  2851 levels unseen since the financial crisisThe downsizing is no small matter for a company whose empire encompasses 175 countries and employs about 305000 people But since the fall of Lehman Brothers in 2008 which set off market upheaval that badly wounded GE when GE Capital struggled  borrow the conglomerate has been selling off pieces of its finance operationThe expansion of the finance business was part of the broader diversification of GE starting in the 1980s under Mr Welch when American industry feared it might not be able  compete against Japan In 1986 for example GE bought RCA mainly for its NBC television network a lucrative cashgenerating business at the time immune from foreign competitionMr Immelt who ok over in 2001 shared some of that enthusiasm for nonindustrial businesses In 2004 GE acquired 80 percent of the Hollywood studio Universal Pictures And while Mr Immelt selectively sold some financial operations GE Capital continued  grow especially in commercial real estate and other loans In 2004 GE even bought a subprime lender in California WMC Mortgage which it shed in 2007 for a 1 billion lossFor years the financial tilt looked smart and relatively easy In an interview in 2010 Mr Immelt recalled if a deal looked like a moneymaker it got the nod And you dont have  build a facry he saidYet the big bet on finance badly wounded GE after Lehmans demise when the market upheaval left the conglomerate hardpressed  borrow debt for its dayday operationsMr Immelt said the company focused on moving carefully its board mindful not  burn stuff out at firesale pricesYet executives increasingly thought that its existing efforts were lost upon the market And GE felt increasingly constrained  its financial arm which like other lenders has suffered from far less growth than in the pastAnd the company was ready  take advantage of a way  shed its designation as a systemically important financial institution  the official name for a lender deemed  the government as o big  fail The socalled Sifi status imposes additional restrictions and requirements upon companies potentially limiting their earnings growthSo in February James B Lee Jr the vice chairman and p deal maker at JPMorgan Chase received a call Could he meet with GEs p managementBoth he and Jamie Dimon JPMorgans chief executive went  meet with Mr Immelt as well as Jeffrey S Bornstein its chief financial officer and Keith S Sherin the chief executive of GE CapitalAlong with Centerview Partners they received the bombshell assignment And it would be a sprint What ensued were six weeks of daily meetings that stretched for hoursThe divestiture campaign will be led primarily  only two firms both in line  claim large fees and great prestige Both JPMorgan and Centerview have been longtime GE advisers having played prominent roles on some of its biggest deals JPMorgan which was named global coordinar for the disposition plan advised GE on its sale of NBCUniversal  Comcast and last year it helped lead the spinoff of Synchrony And for Centerview a boutique investment bank the GE Capital plan will be another plum assignment Leading the charge for the firm was one of its cofounders Blair Effron who advised on GEs 135 billion takeover of the energy assets of the French conglomerate AlsmWith GEs mind made up one of the first potential deals that came up was the disposal of most of the finance arms real estate holdings The most obvious buyer was the Blacksne Group one of the biggest buyers of properties on Wall StreetThe deal team which included Bank of America and Kimberlite Advisors called the head of Blacksnes team Jonathan D Gray and offered him the opportunity  buy exclusively as long as he was willing  move fast and pay upWe thought there was only one buyer who can do this Jon Gray at Blacksne Mr Sherin of GE Capital said We ld him If you can hit this bid on an exclusive basis its yours  Mr Gray responded quickly setting up what became the 265 billion worth of real estate deals announced on FridayDespite not putting the real estate assets up for a competitive auction which may have fetched a higher price Mr Sherin declared himself happy with the result Moving this way assured GE of both a speedy and certain transactionBoth parties think they got a fair price he saidGE said it would remain an acquirer of businesses as well though its deals would be aimed at bolstering industrial operations like its purchase of the Alsm assets But more sales will come While GE has allowed itself two years  carry out the plan the companys executives and advisers anticipate that a huge portion of the deals  particularly for assets in the United States  will be finished  sometime next yearThe company is also confident that subsequent sales will generate attractively priced offers Even before Friday according  the people briefed on the disposal process the biggest private equity firms around the world have asked whether the GE Capital division that lends  leveraged buyouts would ever come up for saleOther potential buyers include financial institutions around the world including big American lenders and Canadian European and Japanese banks eager  snap up businesses as they go up for auctionItll be a food fight one of the people briefed on the process saidSteve Lohr contributed reportingCollapse,banking
Does he share our values and our principles on limited government the proper role of the executive adherence  the ConstitutionAs the speaker of the Republicandominated House Ryan could have posed a harder question Do Republican voters share our values and our principlesThe answer  this question based at least on the 107 million votes cast for Trump in Republican primaries and caucuses so far is noBut thats not all There is also strong evidence that most traditional public opinion surveys inadvertently hide a segment of Trumps supporters Many voters are reluctant  admit  a live interviewer that they back a candidate who has adopted such divisive positionsWhy is this important Because an online survey whatever other flaws it might have resembles an anonymous voting booth far more than what you tell a pollster doesTrumps advantage in online polls compared with live telephone polling is eight or nine percentage points among likely votersThis difference Dropp notes is driven largely  more educated voters  those who would be most concerned with social desirabilityThese findings suggest that Trump will head in the general election with support from voters who are reluctant  admit their preferences  a live person in a phone survey but who may well be inclined  cast a ballot for Trump on Election DayI asked a number of experts about the disparity between online and phone polls All of them  Alan Abramowitz John Sides Michael Tesler and Lynn Vavreck political scientists who specialize in the analysis of poll data  agreed that in the case of highly contentious issues respondents can be more willing  express their real views anonymously  a computer rather than  a humanmay be due  social desirability bias  people are more willing  express support for this privately than when asked  someone elseThe accompanying chart which uses data provided  The Times  Marc Hetheringn and Drew Engelhardt political scientists at Vanderbilt shows that white Republicans are the most ethnocentric of all voters but also that there are substantial numbers of ethnocentric white Democrats and white independentsA 2016 survey rated whites  ethnocentrism the belief that whites are superior  others Here is how white respondents evaluated these groups  blacks Hispanics Muslims gays and lesbians and transgender people  as a whole relative  whites The survey sorted respondents

respondents232057This suggests that Trump could potentially find significant levels of support not only among Republican voters but also among white Democrats and independentsWhites were surveyed and placed on a 17point scale that gauges the racial resentment they feel ward AfricanAmericans Here is the percentage of Democrats independents and Republicans who fell in the least resentful having a positive view of blacks and most resentful ends of the scaleDemocrats105LEVEL OF RESENTMENTMostLeast2223 of Democrats15Independents105MostLeast421024of white Republicans were at the extreme end of the

RESENTMENTMostMostMostLeastLeastLeast224258231004of DemocratsWhat should prove worrisome for Democrats is that 42 percent of white independents also fall in the four most resentful categories as do 22 percent of white DemocratsEven polls using traditional phone survey methods find notable support for issues high on Trumps agenda You can see this for example in attitudes ward the Chinese Muslims and Mexicans  all of whom Trump has demonizedOr take another Trump theme Islam The PRRI values survey asked whether they agreed or disagreed with the statement the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life Among all voters 56 percent said that they agreed Republican were strongest at 76 percent but independents came in at 57 percent with Democrats trailing at a still robust 43 percentThere are a few conclusions  be drawnFirst the way Trump has positioned himself outside of the traditional boundaries of politics will make it unusually difficult  gauge public support for him and for many of his positionsSecond the allegiance of many white Democrats and independents is difficult  predict  crosspressured as they are  the conflict between unsavory Trump positions they are drawn  and conscience or compunction The ambivalence of many Republicans ward Trump as their partys brazenly defiant nominee will further compound the volatility of the elecrateFinally the simple fact that Trump has beaten the odds so far means that it is not beyond the realm of possibility that he could beat them again If he does take the White House much if not all

We know that resentment is driving much of Donald Trumps success  resentment of elites of the political class of illegal immigrants of protesters of the media  and perhaps most particularly of changes in the demographic makeup of the country that Trump and his followers find unwelcomePart of the explanation for the triumph of resentment is political and economic but one question has nagged at me What is the psychological mechanism underpinning this resentmentMore  the pointOpposition  the surge of nonEuropean nonwhite immigration is a bedrock of the Trump campaign a crucial element of his attack on political correctness and a key component of the loyalty he elicits from noncollege middle and lowerincome voters opposed  liberalized immigration  voters who believe they have been dispossessedIn an email Anastasopoulos writes thatpolls conducted  large survey organizations never ask about immigration in geographic context Instead they ask questions about whether respondents support increasing immigration or granting amnesty for undocumented immigrants in the United States overall rather than say Dayn Ohio or Wilmingn North Carolina places where immigration has been rapidly increasing over the past few years This kind of abstract framing tends  push respondents ward giving more politically correct answers  standard poll questions about immigrationThe result isa significant underestimation of the backlash against newly arriving immigrants and an overestimation of the support for immigration among the publicThe refusal of Democrats and the American left  hear  or  grant some legitimacy   the grievances of white America as it loses power and stature  ascendant minorities and  waves of immigrants from across the globe undergirds the Trump movement In the zero sum world of immigration politics it has proved impossible so far  convincingly affirm the validity of the claims of both sidesThe quest  American liberals and progressives for support or at least lerance of diversity inclusiveness and multiculturalism is likely  prevail  particularly if the compulsory dimension of compliance is curtailedthe feeling you get when people try  sp you from doing something youve been doing and you perceive that they have no right or justification for spping you So you redouble your efforts and do it even more just  show that you dont accept their domination Men in particular are concerned  show that they do not accept dominationPsychological reactance is an aversive affective reaction in response  regulations or impositions that impinge on freedom and aunomy This reaction is especially common when individuals feel obliged  adopt a particular opinion or engage in a specific behavior Specifically a perceived diminution in freedom ignites an emotional state called psychological reactance that elicits behaviors intended  resre this aunomyHaidt applies this  the 2016 electionTranslated  the Trump phenomenon I would say that decades of political correctness with its focus on straight white men as the villains and oppressors  now extended  straight white cisgendered men  has caused some degree of reactance in many and perhaps most white menIn both the workplace and academia Haidt arguesthe accusary and vindictive approach of many social justice activists and diversity trainers may actually have increased the desire and willingness of some white men  say and do unPC thingsIn this atmosphere according  HaidtTrump comes along and punches political correctness in the face Anyone feeling some degree of antiPC reactance is going  feel a thrill in their heart and will want  stand up and applaud And because feelings drive reasoning these feelings of gratitude will make it hard for anyone  present arguments  them about the downsides of a Trump presidencyTrumps anger at being policed or fenced in apparently speaks  the resentment of many American men and their resistance  being instructed particularly  a female candidate on how they should think speak or behaveI have a lot of experience dealing with men who sometimes get off the reservation in the way they behave and how they speak  I am not going  deal with their temper tantrums or their bullying or their efforts  try  provoke me He can say whatever he wants  say about me I could really care lessI dont think a nation can be great that turns its back on the poor and the unfortunateWeve got  do more  raise families incomes We can start  raising the federal minimum wageWere stronger gether When we embrace immigrants not denigrate them When we build bridges not wallsTrump has made Clinn his foil of choiceOn Dec 21 2015 Trump ld an audience in Grand RapidsEven a race with Obama she was gonna beat Obama I dont know who would be worse I dont know how could it be worse But she was going  beat  she was favored  win  and she got schlonged she lost I mean she lostI really deplore the ne of his campaign the inflammary rheric that he is using  divide people and his going after groups of people with hateful incendiary rhericNothing really surprises me anymore I dont know that he has any boundaries at all His bigotry his bluster his bullying have become his campaign And he has  keep sort of upping the stakes and going even furtherIm answering him on what I think voters care about Im answering him on the differences between our records our experience what we want  do for our country how important it is  try  unify the countryJesse Graham a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California suggested that the fact that Clinn is a woman plays a role in this dynamic noting that many Trump followers respond  Clinn in a fashion similar  that of8th grade boys reacting  their homeroom teacher But I think this has more  do with her gender than with any particular behaviors on her part  in other words there are some who would respond  any woman running for president as an 8th grader in homeroom who resents the teacherSimon Hedlin a public policy researcher noted thatsince reactance is driven  perceptions rather than  facts this works well in Trumps favor considering his often cavalier relationship with the truthIn other words reactance can foster a talizing loyalty that does not respond  reasoned fault finding This might help explain Trumps seeming immunity  criticism from his adversaries His followers feel that they have experienced a diminution of freedom and believe that Trump can resre their aunomyHe has won a unique admixture of support based in part on what might be called an antirational or irrational loyalty but also in part on his recognition of legitimate grievances among his adherents that many other politicians belittle or deny This loyalty as Republican candidates found during the primaries is far wider and deeper than anyone not sharing it expectedClinn remains the favorite but she faces five months of treading water in a shark tank She has yet  discover a compelling rebuttal  Trump on political correctness and it will be difficult for her  placate opponents of immigration while holding her advantage with her base Nonetheless although her bite is not as lethal as Trumps she will soon have almost the entire Democratic Party in her corner including a cadre of operatives whose specialty is drawing bloodThomas B Edsall is the author most recently of The Age of Austerity How

But Senar Sherrod Brown Democrat of Ohio offered unreserved applause Having lobbied the administration in public letters and private meetings  go after Chinese steel imports he hailed Mr Trumps announcement Thursday as a breakthrough For far o long he said in a statement Chinese cheating has shuttered steel plants across our state and put Ohioans out of workAs Mr Brown seeks a third term in 2018 it is his brand of indignant populism setting the ne for Democrats in Ohio where the governorship and several congressional seats are also up for grabs Long a crucial swing state Ohio may now be the most vital proving ground for a progressive economic message in Trump country Democrats there have adopted a rallying cry that echoes both Mr Trumps rheric and traditional unionhall populism assailing Wall Street banks and multinational corporations for exploiting workers and accusing Washingn of colluding in their perfidyA full list of elections for the House and Senate including which races matter most for congressional controlThe Republican establishment has captured the government Mr Brown said When it comes  what theyre really trying  do every day its the bidding of the billionaire Republican establishment  of Wall Street of the drug companies of the gun lobBoth national parties have a great deal at stake in Ohio For Republicans the 2018 elections are a test of their ascendancy across the Midwest and whether Mr Trumps appeal  workingclass white voters might lift others on the right He carried a majority of union households in Ohio sundering the onandoff alliance of AfricanAmerican voters with white union members that has periodically delivered the state  DemocratsOhio Republicans are fielding a formidable if somewhat ungainly ticket mimicking the national partnership of oldschool Republicans and Trumpstyle insurgents The state party has backed Mike DeWine a lowkey former senar who is Ohios atrney general for governor and Representative Jim Renacci a more combative Trump ally for Senate Mr Renacci a wealthy au dealer had been battling Mr DeWine for the nomination for governor but switched  the Senate race after an appeal from the White HouseAmong national Democrats Ohio is an urgent priority for reasons both symbolic and practical Vicries in 2018 could help them contest the state in 2020 and winning the governorship could give Democrats a hand in the drawing of congressional maps Prominent Democratic leaders are already sketching out visits Ms Warren has raised money with Mr Brown and plans  campaign for Mr Cordray and former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr has committed  hosting a fundraising event for Mr Brown soon and will campaign extensively in Ohio next fall people briefed on their plans saidFor Democrats like Ms Warren and Mr Biden the state is an inviting arena  deliver a more pointed message on economic inequality than the one Democrats are likely  deploy in the areas most crucial  control of the House In their quest  pick up 24 seats congressional Democrats have focused heavily on courting moderate suburban voters who dislike Mr Trump and for whom issues like trade and union rights are remote considerationsBut Michael Podhorzer political direcr of the national AFLCIO said that in Ohio the Democrats paramount goal had  be reversing the lurch of workingclass whites ward the Republican Party He said union members have edged away from Mr Trump in polling conducted  labor groups but Democrats must overcome skepticism that they are real on populist issuesIts a state that is very suspicious of Democrats on economic issues Mr Podhorzer said How things turn out is going  be a real indicar of whether Ohios going  be a battleground state in 2020The Democrats determination  reassemble a bluecollar coalition was on display recently in Lorain a once industrial wn about 30 miles west of Cleveland where Mr Cordray 58 pitched himself  a crowd of labor officials arrayed in wooden chairs in a fluorescentlit hall Mr Trump fought Mrs Clinn  a draw in Lorain County in 2016 President Barack Obama carried it  about 15 points in 2012Introduced  the crowd as a warrior against Wall Street Mr Cordray called the governorship a platform  fight back for working people and pledged  battle the Republicancontrolled Legislature on union rights and defend Ohios stillcontested Medicaid expansion In an interview he said Democrats had erred in 2016  allowing themselves  be seen as a party of the status quoPeople do want somebody who will fight for them said Mr Cordray who vowed  compete not just in big cities but also in the middlesized wns around Ohio where they feel things moving gradually away from them and nobody seems  careA softspoken lawyer Mr Cordray acknowledged that he had  reintroduce himself  Ohio after seven years in the Obama administration In a sign of his campaigns national import Mr Cordray met with Mr Obama in Washingn late last fall after stepping down from the consumer bureau Mr Cordray said the former president had been encouraging of his campaignMr Obama has not yet issued an endorsement and while several Democrats have dropped out of the race  back Mr Cordray he must overcome a rowdy set of Democratic rivals in a May primary election The former Representative Dennis Kucinich 71 a freewheeling firebrand who has aligned himself at times with both Mr Trump and Senar Bernie Sanders of Vermont appears  be his most nettlesome foeRepublicans however are girding for Mr Cordray Mr DeWine still facing a challenger on the right has begun swiping at Mr Cordray lumping him with a cadre of Democrats that he says mismanaged the state Wagering that Ohioans are mostly happy with the states direction Mr DeWine is presenting himself as a steady handWe cant go back  the days of Ted Strickland and Richard Cordray Mr DeWine warned last month at a local party dinner in Clinn County northeast of Cincinnati linking Mr Cordray with an unpopular former governorBut Mr DeWine 71 also allowed in an interview that Ohioans remain restless even after years of Republican dominance Theres still a feeling of dissatisfaction I think with government he said adding that the mood had helped elect Mr TrumpWhether Mr Trump can again bend that dissatisfaction  Republicans advantage could seal their prospects in Ohio In the Senate race Mr Renacci 59 has staked his campaign on his relationship with the president and attacked Mr Brown for opposing Mr Trumps tax cuts Both he and the president Mr Renacci said in an interview want  make sure Ohio is great againBut the tangled lines

groups in the socalled altrightI came  the realization around the inauguration that we must take this from an online activist movement  a reallife activist movement he ld me I decided that was my callingAfter a few phone calls Eli agreed  give me an oncamera interview at Richard Spencers apartment in Alexandria Va Spencer 39 plays the big brother  many teenagers and 20somethings drawn  the altright and his onebedroom apartment has become a frat house for white nationalists passing through the DC area When I was there a steady stream of young men and an occasional woman flowed in and out Although Eli lives less than an hour away he often crashes there on late nights spent drinking and planning the next event He proudly ld me he always gets the couch while others sleep on the floorAfter a short time filming behind the scenes with Eli and his associates a theme emerged He kept emphasizing a connection between the military and the altright He said many of his compatriots were veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan who had become disillusioned with the American political system after fighting in unwinnable conflicts In his telling members of the altright were patriotic Americans who had come  their extreme worldview through honorable life experience not hatredHe mentioned that he o had served in Iraq But when I asked him  elaborate he waved off the question It was boringBoring I had heard soldiers say they experienced periods of boredom on deployment but I had never heard anyone sum up time in a war zone that way I emailed the Army  verify details of his service While I waited  hear back from them my colleagues and I combed through altright podcasts in which he talked about his lifeThe podcasts were laced with the most abhorrent racist vulgarities I had ever heard Not only did they reveal more about Elis war sry but they also gave me insight in how he talked before he became media conscious and sanitized his message With me he insisted that the media unfairly applies labels like white supremacist and neoNazi  members of the altright  browbeat white people out of identity politics But in the podcasts recorded less than a year ago he and his friends were unabashedly racist and antiSemitic He also spun tales of being embedded with the Iraqi Army of being on the lookout for Chechen snipers and of killing muds a racial slur for ArabsWhen I got paperwork back from the Army and the National Guard confirming that he had never deployed I was not surprised At the same time I couldnt believe he would lie so boldly first  his fellow members of the altright and then  a Times reporter on cameraHis parents declined  speak with me but I called some of his former friends and fellow soldiers who ld me Eli had wanted  deploy but his timing was off He graduated from high school in 2010 and went straight on  a couple of semesters of college  the end of 2011 the last troops had left Iraq They also confirmed that Elis unit in the Pennsylvania National Guard did not deploy anywhere else during the roughly six years he served and neither did heI wanted  give Eli a chance  respond  my findings and I pondered the different ways I could bring it up I was nervous about confronting him in person What if he attacked me and my filmmaking partner Andrew Michael Ellis upon realizing that he had been found outI talked with The Timess security consultant who helped me outline a contingency plan But in the end I didnt have  worry because he said no  another oncamera interview Didnt I have enough material  now he askedSo I picked up the phone and called him After informing him that I was recording the call I launched right inThe Army tells me that you did not deployHe paused The Army tells youI explained that I had gotten his official records from the Army and the National GuardSo did you go  Iraq I askedI was in Kuwait he said I ld you that beforeYou ld me you went  Kuwait and then you went  IraqBasically its very similar the way it works he saidWe talked for a while longer and his sry kept changing but he did not back down He wavered between blaming a military clerical error and saying that a military form he would send me would clear up the confusion once and for allHe still hasnt sent me the form or any other proof that he deployed He also doesnt have any phos He had already ld me that he lost them all when his Facebook account was shut downLike many of his peers Eli was already using an invented name Eli Mosley was inspired  the British fascist leader Oswald Mosley So why not make up a few aubiographical details especially ones  boost his reputationThe movement itself also relies on falsehoods It includes Holocaust deniers and pseudointellectuals who spout unsubstantiated theories about the science behind racial difference In order  reach mainstream Americans white supremacists have learned  cloak their racism in disorienting terms like white identity politicsDeception is baked in the altright so Eli Mosley is a perfect match for the movementvideoCollapse,politics
Over the last year Jessica Dimson a pho edir on the Politics desk of The New York Times has helped lead a team of phographers in covering 50 primaries and caucuses 21 debates and countless campaign events Ms Dimson who graduated from Yale joined the Times in 2011 working as a pho edir on the Metro and National desks Prior  The Times she was a pho edir at Departures and Vanity FairWhat makes a great political phographA great political phograph has the qualities of any great phograph  an evocative confluence of aesthetic emotional and hisrical elements But one of the unique challenges of political phography is that the subject matter is often familiar so a phograph that is surprising sophisticated analytical or subtle can really elevate a political phoCampaign sps often are highlyrestrictive stagemanaged events so any pho that penetrates that or goes beyond what a campaign wants you  see is important And often those phographs are not of the candidate themselves There is magic in the peripheryWhy do we commit so many resources  covering the presidential campaign phographically There are many wire service phographers from AP Reuters and others at every event and we can use their phos Why do you want a New York Times phographer oThere are a lot of great wire phographers on the trail but I think what we bring something different than the wiresA hallmark of Times political phography is that we encourage our phographers  take risks in how they document the campaign That is reflected both in what they shoot and what we decide  publish Also many of our phographers have covered presidential campaigns before They understand the rhythms and the dynamics and they bring a context  whats come before 2016 I think that is invaluableI think we want our phographers  be reporters as wellThat is what they do every day on the trail Theyre not just documenting whats happening in front of the camera but bringing context and nuance  the coverageWe have many experienced staff phographers in the campaign this year but also several freelance phographers who work regularly for us What traits do you look for in a potential campaign phographerWe have a number of very talented freelancers on the trail this year some of whom are phographing a presidential campaign for the first timeI give this recommendation  anyone who is new  working with us We know what the candidate looks likeThat is a signal that we want you  take risks and its OK  shoot  the right if all of the phographers standing next  you are shooting  the left Dont follow the pack And we do not expect every pho  be of the candidate and welcome a less literal approachWhats involved in supervising The New York Times phographic coverage of campaignsIts part edir and part facilitar A lot of my job is looking at and selecting images but a lot of time is also devoted  handling the logistics  which phographer is traveling with a candidate keeping track of the candidate schedule at one time there were 20 candidates so there was a lot  juggle helping phographers move from point A  point B and making sure we meet deadlinesI speak with phographers on the road about what they are seeing out there  they are reporters as well as phographers  and give guidance about what we might be interested in on a particular day But I dont direct how or what should be phographed  our phographers dictate that And sometimes Im just there  listen They are often working 18hour days and its taxing out there on the roadThere are also more than 20 political reporters and Im working alongside them  conceptualize ways that we can best illustrate their sriesIs it difficult  get access for our phographersThere are challenges with both campaigns As a news organization we always want more access  the candidates They are on an extensive job interview with the entire country and we believe that we should be able  fully document that process and all that comes with itThe term the campaign trail is a bit of a misnomer this year  the reality is that both Clinn and Trump often fly in for a single event in a day speak for 20 minutes and fly out right after There are no bus urs or diner sps In some cases we are relegated  shoot from literal pens in the back of an audirium That is frustrating and we speak up about that So there is an ongoing conversation about access with the campaignsSo your first presidential national party conventions are coming up How do you plan for something like thisThis is no small undertaking We have about 10 phographers traveling  Philadelphia and Cleveland and all of our staff phographers who are going have covered conventions in past years Some will spend most of their time covering the action inside the arena while others will be dedicated  covering and tracking protests and the scene outsideEvents like these are where The Times really excels at giving readers an unvarnished and immediate sense of what is transpiring We have the ability  transmit phographs very quickly often in a matter of seconds and can then publish them on our site and  social media platforms  including Twitter Facebook and Instagram  a few seconds after that I wont attempt  explain all of the indepth technical aspects because Im lucky  work with people who understand it better than I do and make it all happen but we have hardwired lines at various spots in the arena and phographers will filing directly from their cameras There are other aspects involving power supplies routers and remotes but I leave that  the expertsI will be in the arena editing phos as they come and another pho edir on the politics desk Morrigan McCarthy will be onsite as well Tanner Curtis who works on the National desk will be editing in New YorkWe can adjust our coverage based on how things transpire over the next two weeks Were very nimble in that way We also have phographers who are going  be traveling with each candidate before their arrival at their respective conventionThe Times often gets complaints about coverage often  both sides of an issue or a presidential campaign What does fairness mean in visual political coverageFairness is of paramount importance  us and if you view our coverage in tality over the course of the last 15 months I think you will find that we are balanced in how we represent the campaigns visually We are mindful not just of which images run but also how they run  the context in which an image is published the prominence of a particular sry is it a news item or a more analytical piece  all of those are facrs in our decisionThis is a particularly polarizing election and readers may have strong feelings about certain images Politics is a very personal issue for most people and I welcome the dialogue  differing interpretations of a phograph are valuable and essential  the medium For the most part when we do get feedback it has been very positive I think that our audience values a lesstraditional approach  our visual coverage,politics
The 2016 RaceMr Finnigan ok what he called a leap of faith last week and quit his truck dispatcher job  immerse himself in Decision Desk HQ hoping he could find major funding  expand operationsI recently chatted with him about the significance of Pennsylvania and some of his other passions including his family and astronomy This is a condensed and lightly edited transcript of our email conversationMore collegeeducated voters wealthy voters and suburban voters are drifting away from the Republican Party while noncollege whites and residents of rural and exurban areas are moving ward it Diversity has hit the suburbs themselves Once overwhelmingly white the inner suburbs of Philadelphia in Delaware and Montgomery and Bucks have seen an explosion in nonwhite residents just like they have in Virginia California Colorado Illinois Michigan heck nearly everywhereWell when I watched the changes in registration and I saw Trumps surprising strength in the state it was encouraging because I felt vindicated Its happening But the why for a lot of these voters concerned me A lot of these people are desperate their communities riddled with prescription drug addiction and stunted incomes and their family structure has broken down Nobody regardless of what catchy sound bite or big smile is going  fix their problems for them If Trump gets elected their lives arent going  improve Once hes out of office theyll end up even more jaded and disconnected than they already areThe Upshots presidential forecast updated dailyTrumps campaign strategy mirrors a parody of conservatism angry afraid racially motivated terrified of inevitable change This is clearly turning off moderates and even conservative suburbanites and not just in Pennsylvania Unchecked it will reverse the impressive gains Republicans had enjoyed recently in many purple and blue states like Wisconsin and MarylandAs the overseer of the Decision Desk I have  separate the personal from the political with regards  operations but from my own Twitter account Ive made it clear how I feel about the blatant racism expressed  the altright But my greatest animosity isnt targeted at them because you will always have a small contingent of people with radical beliefs that wont gain lasting traction outside of forums and anonymous trolling My disappointment is saved for the websites and institutions that employed a lot of these writers linked a lot of their material even promoted some of it and only became outraged when they themselves became the targetThe changing makeup of the country isnt the real problem the Republicans face They must have a very clear set of unifying goals Whats the goal for the party these days One wing wants no amnesty the other wants an open border Social conservatism is seeing uneven success and was outright rejected in many ways in favor of a New Yorkers populism What does the party as a whole even believe in anymoreThe Upshots Senate election forecast for 2016 updated daily with the latest pollsWere Americas second pair of eyes on election night and feel that with enough support we can give the public a more comprehensive understanding of how their vote is countedWait who am I kidding  Pennsylvania is the sun and the moon and stars Its everything rightLet me close with these two questions1 In what year will Republicans win Pennsylvania2 Whats the best astronomical metaphor for Donald Trump and this 2016 election campaignBrandon1 2020 or 2024 Democrats win this time but eventually the desire for change will outlast even their favorable demographics When the Republicans win the White House back they carry Pennsylvania with them Ahab will get his whaleCollapse,politics

While white male collegeeducated voters are not commonly seen as part of the Trumpled nationalist movement that rejects globalism and multiculturalism poll data shows that a substantial percentage of them do belong in this campNearly half of collegeeducated Republicans men and women believe immigrants burden the country  taking jobs housing and health care a view shared  62 percent of noncollege

political scientists why Trump appeals  educated white menHoward Rosenthal a political scientist at NYU sent a thoughtful reply  my inquiryThe past 50 years have witnessed a very substantial redistribution from white males  minorities and women I supported and now believe in the public policies that accomplished this redistribution But redistribution it isThe adoption of redistributive policies favoring women and minorities has in Rosenthals unvarnished view fundamentally changed the character of the political partiesThe Democratic Party and Hillary Clinn are engaged in identity politics And the redistribution is not winwin Rosenthal wrote adding thatidentity politics is a matter of social justice that has had limited economic benefits for white males throughout the income distributionThe meaning of a college degree Rosenthal points out has changed over the yearsThere has been a large expansion of the botm tier with relatively more students graduating from Cal State Hayward or Cal State Dominguez Hills than from Berkeley or UCLA And those graduating from lower tier schools may not be doing all that well in the economyMale college graduates who are struggling are

menWithout referring  Clinn Eagly and Koenig argue that the stereotype of women as belonging in the helping or communal professions has remained constant despite massive change in womens roles in the 20th century This is becausemost of the movement of women from homemaking  employment has put them in occupational roles that are perceived as not especially agentically demanding but highly communally demandingThe consequences Eagly and Koenig writeare apparent in their employment in the expanding service educational and health care secrs of the economy Specifically the six most common occupations for women in the United States are secretary and administrative assistant registered nurse elementary and middle school teacher cashier nursing psychiatric and home health aides and retail salespersonswomens identities as aspiring political leaders continue  be problematic and require women  negotiate a double bind if they are o feminine they are deemed incompetent If they are o masculine they are considered not likeableA number of pollsters pointed out  me that hostility  Clinn is more important than the appeal of Trump in the continuing support for Trump among white college men Her negatives are awful the Republican pollster Bill McInturff noted in an emailBias against women in leadership roles often accompanies bias against racial and ethnic minorities and may contribute  the willingness of white men  both college and noncollege   accept flawed leadership from Trump rather than grant authority  women  or  AfricanAmericans or HispanicsPeople are often biased against others outside of their own social group showing prejudice emotional bias stereotypes cognitive bias and discrimination behavioral bias In the past people used  be more explicit with their biases but during the 20th century when it became less socially acceptable  exhibit bias such things like prejudice stereotypes and discrimination became more subtle aumatic ambiguous and

men Did the campaigns initial plan  play up Clinns soft grandmotherly persona backfire at a time of mounting global turmoil Is it a consequence of the campaigns unabashedly liberal turn on social

But the bold declarations of Mr Rauner who arrived pledging  shake things up have wilted some As he runs for a second term Mr Rauner is one of the most vulnerable incumbent governors in the nation having spent much of his brief political career clashing with Democrats who control the State Legislature over labor unions taxes the states budget and schoolsMr Rauner 61 who sold himself as an outsider who would bring a businessmans sensibility  the task of untangling Illinoiss political and fiscal morass now finds himself fighting for reelection on two dizzying fronts On the right Jeanne Ives a Republican legislar and Army veteran known for her hardright stances on taxes immigration and abortion has forced him in a contested primary on Tuesday And on the left a whos who of Democratic circles wants  take on Mr Rauner this fall including JB Pritzker a billionaire heir and entrepreneur Chris Kennedy a businessman and son of Robert F Kennedy and Daniel Biss a suburban state senarOn one tape from 2008 collected as part of an FBI wiretapping of Mr Blagojevich Mr Pritzker suggested that Mr Blagojevich appoint Jesse White the longtime Illinois secretary of state who is black  fill the empty Senate seat On the secretly recorded conversation Mr Pritzker called Mr White the least offensive choice who would provide cover on the AfricanAmerican thing Mr Pritzker has since apologized for his comments which have threatened  derail crucial support among black voters Mr Blagojevich was convicted of corruption charges in 2011 and is currently serving a 14year sentence at a federal prison in ColoradoAs governor Mr Rauner is perhaps best known for presiding over a budget crisis that paralyzed Illinois for two years pressing for socalled rightwork provisions and publicly sparring with Michael J Madigan the powerful Democratic speaker of the House who also serves as the chairman of the states Democratic Party On the campaign trail Mr Rauner sometimes seems  be running not against his actual opponents but against Mr Madigan whose longstanding entrenched role at the center of state politics has become a matter of debate In recent weeks Mr Madigan has been under intense scrutiny for his handling of sexual harassment complaints at the Capil and in his political organizationMr Rauner declined an interviewThroughout his first term v Rauner has worked  grow good jobs fight corruption and save taxpayer dollars Will Allison a spokesman for Mr Rauners campaign said in an email The governors reform agenda is the perfect contrast  JB Pritzkers outspoken willingness  raise taxes and embrace oneparty rule in Illinois under Mike MadiganMr Pritzker 53 has received prized endorsements from Senar Richard J Durbin Democrat of Illinois and labor unions including the Illinois AFLCIO After holding a campaign round table last month with Latino legislars at a Mexican restaurant in Chicagos Buckwn neighborhood Mr Pritzker said that he had decided  run because of his concern that the state is under siege led  a governor who is a failureBruce Rauner kind of put on his Carhartt jacket and tried  convince people in central and southern Illinois that hes one of them Hes from Winnetka Mr Pritzker said referring  the moneyed North Shore suburb where Mr Rauner owns a house He ld them he was going  stand up for them and he hasntMr Kennedy a realestate developer said in an interview that he had decided  run partly because of his worries over people leaving Illinois a sign of economic decline Mr Rauner was given a chance  succeed and has failed he saidI think hes emerged as the worst governor in the hisry of Illinois and maybe the worst sitting governor in the United States Mr Kennedy said Maybe he was a good invesr but hes a terrible CEOAfter Mr Pritzkers taperecorded conversations with Mr Blagojevich were released Bishop Larry Trotter senior pasr of Sweet Holy Spirit Church on the South Side of Chicago withdrew an invitation for Mr Pritzker  speak  his congregation he said because there was such rage in the community over his remarksA white wealthy man gets  say whatever he wants  say about black people and insult black people How can he be our governor he asked in an interviewAfter meeting with Mr Pritzker the bishop reinstated the invitation  speak at his church which Mr Pritzker accepted a spokeswoman for the candidate saidFor the moment Mr Rauner must contend with Ms Ives his Republican challenger in next weeks race Mr Rauner has dismissed her as a fringe candidate but Ms Ives a lawmaker from suburban Whean who graduated from West Point portrays herself as the true conservative in the race She says Mr Rauner is o moderate on social issues She has described samesex partnerships as completely disordered relationships that

Can Washingns Russia hands help explain why the postCold War relationship has gone off the railsThis strange sry included an intriguing deur in the recent hisry of United States foreign policy One of Rybkas initial posts on the Deripaska affair was a short audio clip from a conversation that ok place on the oligarchs yacht in August 2016 As they sailed off the coast of Norway Rybka and Deripaska were joined  an influential Kremlin official named Sergei Eduardovich Prikhodko and in the clip Deripaska who made his fortune during the violent aluminum wars of the 1990s explains some things about geopolitics  Rybka who was 26 at the time Our relations with America are bad Deripaska says Why Because the person in charge of them is Sergei Eduardovichs friend  Nuland is what she is called When she was young  about your age  she spent a month living on a Soviet whaling vessel Ever since then shes hated our countryDeripaska was referring  Vicria Nuland a longtime American government official and Russia hand as Russia experts are sometimes known who at the time of the video was assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia Nuland had in fact as Deripaska said spent time aboard a Soviet vessel fishing not whaling in the mid1980s whether she hated Russia ever after is a subject of some dispute She spent three decades in various posts in the State Department and the White House In 2013 as a newly confirmed assistant secretary of state she became the point person for the increasingly fraught situation in Ukraine where large protests against the president following his decision  pull out of an economic agreement with the European Union eventually led  his ouster Early in the protests Nuland was filmed handing out sandwiches pastries and cookies  the demonstrars in what some viewed as a provocative show of solidarity Later as the government began  tter she made a call that was intercepted and leaked online most likely  Russian intelligence in which she discarded the notion of working with the EU  resolve the crisis Expletive the EU she memorably saidWhat was remarkable about the episode was the utter confidence with which Nuland seemed  speak for the United States and its policy From the start of his administration President Barack Obama had tried  lower tensions with Russia and refocus American attention on a rising China he had made clear he wanted no part in the problems of the postSoviet periphery Yet in the middle of the uprising in Kiev there was Nuland encouraging protesters and insulting European allies And after the call leaked it was Nuland as much as Obama who came  personify American policy for everyday Russians   the point that a professional sex coach like Rybka knows more about her biography than all but a handful of AmericansDuring two decades on and off reporting in Russia and the postSoviet states  in the turbulent 90s the wealthy but depressing aughts and finally during the eruption of violence in Ukraine  I occasionally heard people talk about how the Americans wanted this or that political outcome The events in Ukraine demonstrated or seemed  demonstrate that behind the visible facade of changing presidents and changing policy statements and changing styles the Americans were actually a small core of officials who not only executed policy but also effectively determined it The continuing wars in Ukraine and Syria the apparent Russian campaign of targeted assassinations on foreign soil the widening gyre of sanctions and countersanctions and the stillfestering question of Russian meddling in the 2016 election have made for the worst relations between the two countries since the 1980s Understanding how  get out of this mess will require understanding how we got in it There may be no better place  start than with the people inside the American government who have been working on the subject since 1991  the Russia handsSome Russia observers argue that this pattern of failure is a result of Russian intransigence and revisionism But others believe that the intransigent and unchanging one in the relationship is the United States  that the country has never gotten past the idea that it won the Cold War and therefore needs  spread at all costs the American way of lifeLast summer a few months after the inauguration of President Trump I began traveling  Washingn  speak with Russia hands those who had worked on Russia inside the State Department the National Security Council or the Department of Defense I interviewed hands who served in the government as far back as Jimmy Carter and up  the current administration some served Republican presidents others served Democrats but a vast majority served both partiesThe government as a rule discourages specialization Military officers and diplomats are constantly transferred from one post  another from one region  the next Still specialists do emerge Many but not all Russia hands have PhDs  in Russian hisry or political science or security studies Others got their graduate education on the job Nuland worked on the Soviet fishing trawler Daniel Fried her eventual close collaborar at the State Department spent a semester as a livein basitter for an American Embassy family in Moscow Seeing Communism up close cures you of all your leftliberal illusions that the Cold War is a misunderstanding that can be cured through arms control and dtente Fried says Communism up close is very ugly Some Russia hands started out as civil servants or military officers others as academics pulled in government service after working as advisers on political campaignsThe Russia hands have clear generational characteristics Those who came of age at the height of the Cold War worked on Russia because it was Americas most important foreignpolicy problem Many of those who finished graduate school or officertraining school in the late 80s or early 90s bear the scars of having studied a subject that became seemingly irrelevant overnight In 1989 Peter Zwack now a retired brigadier general was a young militaryintelligence officer stationed in Germany taking Russian language and politics courses I was waiting for them  come through the Fulda Gap he says referring  a section of West Germany through which NATO planners expected the Soviets  push large mechanized formations We were outmanned I thought we were outgunned But the Soviets never came and for the next 20 years Zwack worked in the Balkans then Afghanistan and South Korea before finally returning  Russia in 2012 as defense attach  the American EmbassyWith the collapse of the Soviet Union the United States had  staff 14 new embassies in the postSoviet republics Many of the Foreign Service officers who emerged from these postings did so with a somewhat jaundiced view of Russia When you start looking at the Russians  the people who have been visited  the Russians says Fried who spent a fair amount of time in Poland during his long career in the Foreign Service you tend  see it a different wayFinally there is the younger generation those 40 and under These Russia hands are for the moment a rarer species If you were an ambitious young Foreign Service officer after 911 you wanted  get sent  some reconstruction team in Afghanistan or Iraq says Andrew Weiss who worked on Russia at the National Security Council during the Clinn administration and now runs the Russia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace You wanted  learn Arabic If you were ambitious you did not want  go  the embassy in UkraineAs in other foreignpolicy secrs the Russia hands divide less along party lines than along foreignpolicy philosophies They are either realists or internationalists Realists tend  be cautious about American overseas commitments and deferential ward state sovereignty internationalists tend  be more inclined  universalist ideals like democracy and human rights even where these are forced  cross borders But the two supposed categories are blurred  a thousand facrs not least of which being that realists dont like being called realists because it suggests that they have no values and internationalists dont like  be called internationalists as opposed  realists because it suggests that they have no common sense In the end a vast internationalist middle consisting of neoconservative Republicans and interventionist Democrats predominates with tiny slices of hard realists on the right and soft realists or neorealists on the left And there are many shades of difference among all these peopleThe longtime Russia hand Stephen Sestanovich a veteran of the Reagan and Clinn administrations says there are two kinds of Russia hands  those who came  Russia through political science and those who came  it through literature The literature hands he suggests sometimes let their emotions get the best of them while the politicalscience hands like Sestanovich are more cool and collected Fried who served in every administration from Carter  Obama also thinks there are two kinds of Russia hands though he draws a different dividing line There are those like himself who put Russia in context held up against the light of outside standards and consequences These people tend  be ugh on Russia And then there are those who take Russia on its own terms attractive and wonderful but subject  romanticization These people tend  give Russia what Fried would consider a passThen there are those like Michael Kofman a young Kievborn military analyst at the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlingn Va who say that there only appear  be two kinds of Russia hands There are the nice missionaries who knock on your door and say Hey have you heard the good news about democracy freedom and liberalism And then there are the crusaders who are trying  claim the heathen Eastern European lands for democracy and freedom But theyre basically the same person theyre two sides of the same coinThere are two kinds of Russia hands or maybe there are six kinds of Russia hands or maybe there is an infinite variety of Russia hands And yet the mystery is this After all the many different Russia hands who have served in the United States government the countrys relations with Russia are as they have always been  badThe first highlevel Russia hand of the postCold War era was a man named Nelson Strobridge Talbott III or Strobe for short The scion of a prosperous Ohio family his grandfather the first Nelson Strobridge Talbott was captain of the Yale football team in 1914 Talbott followed his forefathers  Yale where he studied Russian literature and won a Rhodes scholarship  Oxford There he found himself rooming with a wonky gregarious Georgewn graduate named Bill Clinn Talbott remained interested in Russia writing his masters thesis on Mayakovsky translating Nikita Khrushchevs memoirs and then becoming a foreign correspondent  and eventually a columnist  for Time magazine He was the first journalist  track down and interview Joseph Brodsky upon his exile  the West in 1972 Looks like we lucked out Brodsky wrote in his diary Hes read me Talbotts fundamental view of the USSR was that it could be reasoned with in the pages of Time he regularly praised the virtues of arms control and dtente and was despised for it  more ardent Cold Warriors When Clinn was elected president Talbott came on  advise his old roommate on what Clinn believed  be his most pressing foreignpolicy concern the transformation of Russia in a viable Americanfriendly democracy on the eastern edge of EuropeThings did not turn out that way and most of the reasons were internal  Russia But the United States was not without its share of blame The economic advice dispensed  the gurus of what was known as the Washingn Consensus weakened an already vulnerable Russian state Average Russian citizens saw their living standards and life expectancies drop It was Talbott who offered one of the pithier critiques of the doctrine known as shock therapy What the Russian people wanted Talbott said was less shock and more therapy The remark led  one of the srmiest passages of his political careerBut he weathered it During his tenure the United States made one of the most momenus foreignpolicy choices of the post1991 era the decision  expand NATO eastward first in the former countries of the Warsaw Pact then in the former republics of the Soviet Union itself Talbott at first was opposed or at least as he now puts it deeply riven On one hand the Eastern European countries some of which were now led  heroic former dissidents wanted very much  join the military alliance on the other the Russians warned Talbott  with a mirthless smile as he later recalled  that NATO was  them a fourletter word If the Cold War was really over as the Americans kept saying it was why expand a Cold War military alliance set up expressly  deter and contain the Soviet Union But as much as Talbott loved Russia there were clear advantages  securing the Wests gains If the leadership of a country has any view but the following Talbott ld me last summer its not going  be the leadership of that county for very long And that is We do what we can in our own interest But the NATO question Talbott admitted was complicated Should we have had a higher wiser concept of our real interests that would require us  hold back on what many people would say is our own current interestAt the time the debate was taking place  1993 and 1994  much of the State Department and the Pentagon ok the antiexpansion view arguing that it would needlessly antagonize Russia at a difficult moment in its postCommunist journey and that the alliance was unwieldy enough without incorporating three fledgling Eastern European democracies not  mention eventually Romania But there were some who disagreed A small working group at RAND produced a report arguing for NATO expansion as key  the future of Eastern Europe We talked  the Poles and they said If you dont let us in NATO were getting nuclear weapons We dont trust the Russians  one of the reports authors a former Air Force officer and Pentagon strategist named Richard L Kugler ld me Then we talked  the Germans They said The line of contact with the Russians now runs through Warsaw If you dont defend it we will We had a vision of a nucleararmed Poland being fortified  German troops facing off with the Russians  I dont think anyone wanted that The report was laughed at and rejected in some quarters  a State Department official supposedly threw it in the trash in front of one of its authors  but Fried then at the National Security Council started using it  lob inside the administration for a more robust approach  expansion Talbott initially resisted but he and Clinn soon came aroundThe decision on NATO was essentially made  early 1994 but it would take some years before the first countries joined the alliance and in the meantime relations between Russia and the United States steadily declined Russia was angered  the NATO bombing of Bosnian Serb positions in 1995  the American insistence that the Russians sp the sale of nuclear technology  Iran and especially  the 1999 NATO bombing  just a few weeks after the Czech Republic Hungary and Poland finally joined the alliance  of Belgrade That conflict almost expanded when a small contingent of Russian troops seized the Pristina airport in Kosovo If a British officer named James Blunt had not refused  act on an order from Gen Wesley Clark  clear the airport things might have turned out a lot worse Blunt went on  fame as a rock musician with the hit song Youre Beautiful but the RussiaUnited States relationship remained precariousThe damage in any case was done We were so excited about the spread of democracy and the collapse of Communism says Olga Oliker direcr of the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washingn There were all these countries saying Yes please take us in NATO with weapons that youll give us  defend ourselves from the Russians who are going  be coming like they always do And we said Well the Russians arent coming but yes please join us in democracyBut the Russians ok it as a sign that we were still against them It was really hard  walk back from From there on out we were doing things that we kept saying Were not doing this  hurt you and that the Russians felt hurt them We didnt do it because we wanted  hurt them We did it because we didnt care if it hurt themFacrs external  Russia played a role here The Sept 11 attacks refocused American foreign policy around counterterrorism We had a long period of inattention because of the war on terror Weiss says It was a long period where anyone who banged his fist on the table and said Mr President Mr President Drop everything youre doing killing bin Ladens inner circle We need  talk  you because Vladimir Putin is mad about blah blah blah You can imagine how that did not rateBut it wasnt just the fight against terrorism The Soviet Unions collapse and Russias subsequent weakness reconfigured the entire process of American decisionmaking When I asked Graham about the decline in relations on his watch he delivered a soliloquy about bureaucracyThe way the NSC is structured he began the way the State Department is structured is through a series of regional and functional bureaus The question is always Who takes the lead In Soviet times when the entire foreign policy of the United States was oriented around countering the Soviet threat the Russia hands frequently ok the lead In the postSoviet era with an increasingly irrelevant Russia the reverse was true Russia was unique in that its a country that was a facr in almost all the major things the US government did but it wasnt in any place the most important facr So youre working on missile defense Russia is clearly an important player in missile defense But that process is not led  the person whos responsible for Russia policy its led  the person whos responsible for nonproliferation policy If you come  energy Russia is obviously an important player in global energy markets but Russia is not the most important player in global energy markets Thats the Saudis and OPEC So when you come  an energy issue the people who are in charge of energy run thatThe same was true of the states of the former Soviet Union which were now independent and the province of different regional desks at the State Department and the NSC The most damaging episode in United StatesRussia relations during Grahams time at the NSC was American cheerleading for the Orange Revolution in Ukraine in late 2004 and early 2005 Graham argued that the Russians saw the color revolutions as the Rose and Orange Revolutions were known as an outgrowth of American policy and feared that regime change would be coming  Russia next But freedom was on the march Graham was ld  All were doing is promoting democracy But youre the Russia expert I saidBut Ukraine is not a Russia issue he said Its a Ukrainian issue Theres a bureau for European affairs that overseas Ukrainian issuesDuring the Orange Revolution the Europe desk at the NSC was run  FriedMy main contribution Graham summed up was preventing things from being worse than they could have beenGraham left government in 2007 Fried his sometime nemesis had become assistant secretary of state for Europe and Eurasia and continued  push vocal American support of Westernleaning governments in former Soviet states Georgia in particular Nuland was the American ambassador  NATO In April 2008 at a NATO summit meeting in Bucharest the alliance announced over strong Russian objections that it intended  eventually admit Georgia and Ukraine Four months later deteriorating security conditions in South Ossetia Georgia provoked an emboldened Saakashvili in an attack on the breakaway region Russian forces intervened crushing the Georgian Army in less than a weekThe next president Barack Obama was the rare American politician with a sense of the fallibility of American power He opposed the Iraq war and spoke honestly about the crimes of the American empire Yet he was also divided in his mind A realist in most of his foreignpolicy leanings Obama chose as his chief Russia hand a Stanford politicalscience professor named Michael McFaulMcFaul had spent years visiting Russia and writing about it He was a Russophile an advocate of more cooperative relations and a critic of the Bush administrations unilateralism in all this a good fit for Obama But he was also an avid internationalist and democracy promoter who had speculated in a widely circulated 2005 essay on the seven facrs for success required for color revolution  the implication being that more such revolutions were necessary and desirable In 2008 McFaul proposed a reset in relations between the two countries This became the administrations policy and for a while it worked A new armscontrol agreement was negotiated Dmitri Medvedev who succeeded Putin as president in early 2008 ured Silicon Valley Russia joined the World Trade Organization And a sprawling supply chain called the Northern Distribution Network was established  move supplies through Russia  NATO troops in Afghanistan The existence of an alternate route gave the United States some leeway in its dealings with Pakistan When Pakistan cut off the supply route in Afghanistan not long after the assassination of Osama bin Laden NATO simply sent more through RussiaBut relations with Russia soon soured The more liberal Medvedev years created an expectation on the part of some Russians that the country would open up when Medvedev announced in 2011 that he was stepping aside that Putin would be returning  the presidency and that this is what they had planned all along there was a feeling of grievous disappointment Three months later spurred  a number of blatant falsifications in the national Duma elections this disappointment erupted in the largest protests of the postSoviet period Hillary Clinn then the secretary of state voiced approval for the protests and expressed serious concerns about the voting irregularities Her comments fed the Kremlins fears that the United States was somehow behind the demonstrations McFaul who arrived as ambassador  Russia in the midst of the protest wave inflamed the situation further  taking a meeting with opposition leaders He was never forgiven  the Russian authorities who proceeded  harass him and his family and denounce him whenever possible as a foreign spyPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times

Snowden and Ukraine Magnitsky was the Magnitsky Act which imposes sanctions on individuals engaged in human rights violations and corruption and was inspired  the death in prison of a Russian tax atrney Sergei Magnitsky who was arrested after uncovering a huge corruption scheme Snowden was Edward Snowden who turned up in Moscow after orchestrating perhaps the most significant leak of American government documents since the Pentagon Papers And Ukraine was of course UkraineUkraine was a catastrophe two decades in the making Its government was as corrupt and ineffectual as any in the postSoviet space it produced neither oil nor gas  serve as a financial cushion and it was divided between a Russianleaning east and a Europeleaning west To make matters worse it was also the host at Sevaspol of the Russian Black Sea fleet whose longterm lease during times of tension tended  become a political footballIn the summer of 2013 with the shock of Snowdens turning up in Moscow still fresh Russian officials started making noise about an association agreement that Ukraine was about  sign with the European Union To the Russians the proposed agreement was a rejection of their own cherished cusms union the Eurasian Economic Union as well as a concrete step ward European integration for a country with which it had profound centuriesold connections And European integration the Russians believed would eventually mean NATO membership hostile troops on the Russian border and an end  the lease for the Russian fleetMcFaul still in Moscow was one of the people  whom the Russians ok these complaints By his own account he was dismissive of their concerns First of all he said it wasnt Russias business what Ukraine signed or didnt sign And second he didnt think the Russians should get all worked up Were talking about an association agreement he ld me Thats expansion of the EU maybe in the year 2040 2050 Ask the Turks about their association agreement Turkey signed a similar agreement with the EU in 1963 and still has not become a member It was just a piece of paper But the Russians didnt seem  think so And neither it would turn out did the Ukrainians When Vikr Yanukovych the president of Ukraine under intense Russian pressure pulled out of the accord with the Europeans people ok  the streetsThe daughter of Sherwin Nuland the surgeon and Yale bioethicist she fell in love with Russian culture after seeing a performance of Chekhovs Three Sisters when she was 12 she studied Russian hisry and politics at Brown worked at a Soviet childrens camp and after that for an embassy family in Moscow Then eager for adventure and contact with reallive Russians she did her ur on the Soviet fishing vessel for seven months not one That experience taught her something about the planned economy After 25 days of drinking and cardplaying the crew did five days of hard work  meet their monthly targets She also says she learned how  drink 10 shots of vodka and still get back  my cabin and put a chair under the doorknob Things could get a little hairy when the boys were drunkShe entered the Foreign Service in 1984 Over a long and eventful career she witnessed the defense of the Russian White House during the attempted hardline coup against Mikhail rbachev served as Talbotts chief of staff during the chaotic 90s worked as Dick Cheneys deputy national security adviser in the years after Sept 11 but before Cheney became Cheney as she put it and served as the State Department spokeswoman under Hillary Clinn She was known inside successive administrations as a Russia hawk but when asked if she hated the country she drew a distinction between Russian culture and the Russian people which she loves and the Soviet strain she sees in Putins Russia which she does not I deplore the way successive governments in Moscow  Soviet and Russian  have abused their own people ripped them off constrained their choices and made us the enemy  mask their own failings Nuland says Hearing her speak with such conviction about governments that in at least one case no longer existed you could understand how she had been over the years a very effective advocate inside several American administrations for her point of viewIn December 2013 with the protests in the center of Kiev just a few weeks old Nuland traveled  Moscow and then  Kiev  try  defuse the crisis that had engulfed the Yanukovych government She made little progress with the Kremlin which was of the opinion that Yanukovych should simply clear the protesters from the streets On her first night in Kiev she was woken  members of her staff The riot police brought out  contain the protests had formed a ring around them and were closing in The demonstrars were desperately singing patriotic songs  keep up their spirits but they were in mortal danger Nuland got on the phone with Washingn and worked  release a statement in Secretary of State John Kerrys name expressing disgust at the move on peaceful protesters After that Nuland says the singing grew louder the demonstrars on the square she ld me were holding their phones in the air displaying the Kerry statement in Ukrainian and Russian The riot troops backed offThe next morning Nuland was  meet with Yanukovych But first she wanted  visit the protest encampment which two weeks in its existence had grown in both scope and moral authority In accordance with Slavic tradition I wanted  bring something Nuland says She ok a large plastic bag filled with treats Alongside Pyatt she handed them out  the protesters and thus was born one of the iconic images of the Ukraine crisis immediately and widely circulated  the Kremlins media apparatuses  a powerful official not a famous politician like Senar John McCain or Secretary of State John Kerry but a representative of the supposedly more neutral American policymaking bureaucracy succoring revolutionaries in the center of Kiev Nuland points out that they also gave food  the riot police Two months later as the Yanukovych government entered its terminal phase Nulands Expletive the EU comment leaked out For many Russians and Europeans the line became emblematic of American arroganceA few weeks later Yanukovych fled the country and Russian troops annexed Crimea In tandem with Fried who had taken the newly established position of sanctions coordinar at the State Department Nuland began drafting harsh sanctions against Putins inner circle individuals involved in the invasion of Ukraine and eventually large Russian companies and banks Fried ld me that one senior State Department official thought this was pretty funny He said  Fried Do the Russians realize that the two hardestline people in the entire US government are now in a position  go after themThe Russians may have realized this perfectly well According  American intelligence agencies two years after the sanctions went in effect the Russians started feeding emails slen from the servers of the Democratic National Committee  WikiLeaks and helping with their distributionKimmage nonetheless found the experience enlightening and he came away with the feeling that a lot of what the American government did had deep and sometimes invisible ideological sources The apparent final triumph of liberal democracy in Europe in 1989 produced two powerful strains in American internationalist foreignpolicy thinking according  Kimmage  one radical the other moderate The radical strain associated with the neocons called for a universal democratization  force if need be This strain was mostly discredited in Iraq But the other strain which aimed  spread Americanstyle democracy as far east as possible in Eurasia has never been discredited It is close  being the conventional wisdom in Washingn and it is carried forth Kimmage suggests  a certain sort of young person typically a graduate of Yale or Georgewn who believes  perhaps  definition  in the virtues of American powerAnd yet there is within the Russiahand community a small countervailing tendency This new generation of Russia hands is deeply skeptical of the missionary impulse that has characterized American policy ward Russia for so long Oliker is one Kimmage another There is also the military analyst Michael Kofman at the Center for Naval Analyses and Samuel Charap at RAND whose recent book on the events leading  the war in Ukraine Everyone Loses written with the Harvard political scientist Timothy Coln lays out week  week the way in which American European and Russian policy in 2012 and 2013 pushed Ukraine in a zerosum choice leading eventually  the collapse of the government and the dismemberment of the country And there are others some who prefer not  be namedDespite some differences in politics all are seeking a less chauvinistic approach  Russia policy They are disgusted  American failures and want them  end I find the past 17 years of continuous warfare  be abnormal and abhorrent one of them wrote in an email Its a real reflection on our policy community that they have placed their nation in this position In the harsh climate of Washingn opinion where an errant edirial could come back in the form of an angry senar reading it aloud at your confirmation hearing they do what they can  push back As a group they have opposed sending weapons  Ukraine as an unnecessary escalation of the proxy war there  We just lost a proxy war in Syria Kofman cried Why do we expect  do better in Ukraine  and are concerned about the current hype over a potential Russian incursion in the Baltics Kofman compared American worries about a Russian invasion of the Baltics  equally farfetched Russian worries about an American move in Belarus I dont know about you he said but Ive never heard anyone in Washingn say Wow Belarus Thats real prime real estate We should get that By the same ken the Russians are amazed that we think they want  take the Baltics They just find it incredible Theyre going  go in the Baltics  which they have no use for  and take on the worlds preeminent military alliance Its crazyKofman believes that some form of conventional deterrence on NATOs eastern flank is useful but he worries that it can turn in what international relations theorists call a security dilemma wherein the actions you take  increase your security cause your adversary  feel threatened so that it takes steps  increase its security forcing you in turn  take further steps  increase yours and so on until war You have  be very careful where you put forces Kofman said You cant start stacking units 20 minutes from St Petersburg Keep in mind Russia is the worlds preeminent Eurasian land power They can put more ground forces in Russia because thats where they happen  live than you can put in the Baltics because thats not where you live Thats not a ugh competitionThese young Russia hands find the current political and news attention  Russia deeply frustrating even as its sources are no mystery  themIm a Democrat said one Russia hand who spoke on the condition of anonymity so that he could comment openly And Russia contributed  the defeat of Secretary Clinn and frankly  our current national tragedy Its hard for me not  think about thatBut the Democrats see this as a political opening And the conversation has moved in politics They dont want  know whats actually happening or what we should actually do They want  beat Trump with this Russia thingOliker of the Center for Strategic and International Studies makes a similar point It used  be you could explain things  people at great length and with nuance and they would say Oh how interesting Youve explained it so well and now I understand better where the Russians are coming from Of course she added they wouldnt do any of it because Russia was secondary or tertiary and no one cared about RussiaNow everyone cares about Russia and theres no nuanceCharap at RAND says that the postelection political climate has made it impossible  work with Russia even on issues that would benefit both sides When the US and Russia work gether they can accomplish things no two other countries can The only reason we were able  kill bin Laden is that the Northern Distribution Network was set up McFaul did that And he had  deal with a lot of people saying Why are we talking  these people Theyre never going  stick  their agreementsEven I was ld once We dont want  be chasing Russia What is this datingThe difference between these Russia hands and most others is less their analysis of Russia than their analysis of America According  Oliker what the United States should be focusing on is managing hegemonic decline Americas vast overseas commitments need  be scaled down bit  bit in a slow and responsible process The amount of money spent on the United States military should be brought in line with hisrical norms and recalibrated  the countrys actual defense needs Diplomacy cheap effective rather than military might expensive deadly counterproductive needs  become Americas primary means of interacting with the world So far Oliker points out the Trump administration is largely doing the oppositeAs for Russia its a threat that needs  be handled not exaggerated We have  talk  them Oliker says If we dont talk  them things are going  get a lot worse Yes they hacked our election Did they invade Ukraine Yup they did that But we talk  countries that do bad things all the time We have  talk  them and as were talking  them we have  understand that they dont think theyre evil I was testifying on the Hill not long ago and I was saying The Russians think theyre acting defensively And the senars were like But weve explained  them over and over that were not a threat Like are you seriousZwack the retired brigadier general who once waited for the Soviets  break through the Fulda Gap and now teaches at the National Defense University agrees Short of a shooting war you have  find bridges he says Some people say Its not business as usual with the Russians But its never business as usual with the Russians Theyre the one nation on the planet that on a bad day  theyll go away o  but they can take us off that planetThe crisis might not happen in the Baltics or over Syria It could happen in the Sea of Okhotsk Youve got all kinds of Russian military stuff out there weve got military stuff the Japanese have stuff It takes one incident  an accident that  someone threatinclined looks like a deliberate action If those commanders cant get on the phone or on email  say This is what it is if the crisis has  now be resolved in Washingn or Moscow it may be o lateCharap at RAND puts it most succinctly The threshold for bad stuff happening in the RussiaUS relationship is pretty high Like nuclear Armageddon Thats low probability he says But high impactFor the past year the administrations p Russia hand has been a Britishborn Harvardeducated hisrian and policy analyst named Fiona Hill A longtime fellow at the Brookings Institution of which Strobe Talbott became president after the end of the Clinn administration Hill is the author of Mr Putin a probing and not entirely unsympathetic biography of the Russian president In that book Hill and her coauthor Clifford Gaddy advocate what another hisrian has called strategic empathy trying  see the situation from the perspective of your adversary  in this case Putin This is the sort of move that more hawkish Russia hands like Fried have long counseled against But it is unclear how much influence Hill has had on current policy One report in The Washingn Post indicated that the president at one point misok her for administrative staff and yelled at her another report in the same paper described her as heading up the recent American expulsion of Russian diplomatic personnel in response  the nerveagent poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in EnglandThere isnt in any case much room  maneuver Fried reached retirement age and left the State Department a few weeks in the Trump administration Nuland not yet of retirement age stepped down the day before Trumps inauguration To show up for work on Inauguration Day and have  do a 180 on US policy ward NATO Russia Germany Brexit  I just couldnt do it she said But their legacy lives on Over the summer and partly in response  the investigation of the Trump campaigns possible collusion with Russia Congress voted overwhelmingly  strip the president of his authority  release Russia from Frieds and Nulands sanctions Only Congress can now end the sanctions In the words of one Russia hand the congressional bill makes the United StatesRussia confrontation structural The president is like a captain holding a wheel that isnt attached  anything said the Russia handIn early March I met  talk about Russia policy with a senior official in the current administration who was not authorized  speak  the press and thus asked not  be identified Nastya Rybka the Instagramming Belarusian escort had just been arrested in Thailand but  my chagrin the official hadnt even heard of her instead the official was focused on a speech Putin had just

OpEd ContribursPresident Obama will be remembered as a thoughtful and dignified president who led a scrupulously honest administration that achieved major changesPeople argue over whether his impatience with politicians and Republican intransigence denied him bigger accomplishments but that argument is beside the point He rescued an economy in crisis and passed the recovery program pulled America back from its military overreach passed the Affordable Care Act and committed the nation  addressing climate change To be truly transformative in the way he wanted however his success had  translate in elecral gains for those who shared his vision and wanted  reform government On that count Mr Obama failedHis legacy regrettably includes the more than 1000 Democrats who lost their elections during his two terms Republicans now have tal control in half of Americas statesWhy such political carnageFaced with the economys potential collapse as he ok office Mr Obama devoted his presidency  the economic recovery starting with resring the financial secr But he never made wage stagnation and growing inequality central  his economic mission even though most Americans struggled financially for the whole of his termAt the same time Mr Obama declined  really spend time and capital explaining his initiatives in an effective way He believed that positive changes on the ground especially from economic policies and the Affordable Care Act would succeed vindicating his judgment and marginalizing his opponentsAbsent a president educating the public about his plans for voters the economic recovery effort morphed in bailouts  bank bailouts au bailouts insurance bailouts By his second year in office he spotlighted the creation of new jobs and urged Democrats  defend our progressWhen President Obama began focusing on those left behind  the recovery he called for building ladders of opportunity That communicated that the president believed the countrys main challenges were unrealized opportunity for a newly ascendant multicultural America rather than the continuing economic struggle experienced  a majority of AmericansMr Obama also offered only tepid support  the most important political acr in progressive and Democratic politics the labor movement In the absence of progressive funders in the mode of the conservative Koch brothers unions are the most important acrs at the state legislative level Yet when the 2010 election ushered in a spate of antiunion governors who eliminated collective bargaining rights for public employees and passed right  work laws Mr Obama never really joined this fight In fact he spent the last couple of years of his presidency pursuing the TransPacific Partnership Agreement a free trade law vociferously opposed  the labor movement Under President Obama union membership has declined  111 percent from 123 percentWhile the Obama campaigns of 2008 and 2012 were models of innovation in online organizing and microtargeting they did not translate in success in the midterm elections or in Hillary Clinns campaign Democratic turnout dropped in 2010 2012 and significantly in 2014 Models it appears do not substitute for the hard work of organizing and engaging voters in nonpresidential years models that apparently drove nearly every decision made  the Clinn campaign are no substitute for listening  votersFinally just as he governed the campaign messages from the president in the midterms and in 2016 were focused on progress and growthOn the eve of the 2016 election the president used the refrain Weve seen America turn recession in recovery and 155 million new jobs Pointedly he said Incomes are rising Poverty is fallingThe publics reaction was stark from the beginning People did not believe his view on the economy and his approval ratings fell in Maine New Hampshire Pennsylvania Iowa Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2010 and in Iowa Michigan North Carolina Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2014  the states that led the workingclass move away from the DemocratsMr Obama did win reelection that year though only after embracing Teddy Roosevelts populist spirit and criticizing the breathtaking greed of a few He declared it a makeorbreak moment for the middle class This posture did not animate his governing message or the 2016 presidential election The president will leave office with a rising approval rating near the same league of Ronald Reagan an economy nearing full employment and real wages tipping up Yet a majority of voters in the last election said the economy was the p issue in their voteWe think voters were sending a clear message They want more than a recovery They want an economy and government that works for them and that task is unfinishedStanley B Greenberg the author of America Ascendant and Anna Greenberg are partners at Greenberg Quinlan RosnerCollapse,politics
In case you werent convinced Democrats are becoming the cosmopolitan elite partyThe table showed support for Hillary Clinn and Donald Trump  income and education It leads  a clear conclusionTrump is competitive among the less affluent and those without college degrees among whom he is behind  3 and 4 points respectively But Clinn is crushing him among college graduates 5734 and among those making 50000 or more 5537The larger conclusion from the data is that the Trump campaign  both through the support Trump generates among workingclass whites and the opposition he generates among better educated more affluent voters  has accelerated the ongoing transformation of the Democratic Party Once a classbased coalition the party has become an alliance between upscale welleducated whites and importantly ethnic and racial minorities many of them low incomeThe voice of the left  especially the old social democratic left  has lost force in recent years Ian Buruma a professor of democracy human rights and journalism at Bard College wrote me in an emailThis is partly because leftwing parties since the 1960s began  switch their attention from working class struggle  identity politicsThere is Buruma went ona common anxiety about the effects of globalism multinational corporate power immigration More and more people feel unrepresented When they complained about immigration or the bewildering changes effected  a global economy such people were o easily dismissed as racists and bigots Now they blame the liberal elites for all their anxietiesRodrik does not let upThey

economy in recent decadesLeft policy makers and analysts Rodrik writes facethe paradox that earlier waves of reforms from the left  Keynesianism social democracy the welfare state  both saved capitalism from itself and effectively rendered themselves superfluousIf liberal public policy intellectuals are unable develop a clear program  refashion capitalism and globalization for the twentyfirst century Rodrik warns the field will be left wide open for populists and farright groups who will lead the world  as they always have   deeper division and more frequent conflictincreasingly disconnected from workingclass America I mean that in a very specific sense Our residences are increasingly segregated  class Our schools are increasingly segregated  class Our extended families are increasingly separated  classMost culturewar conflicts involve sexuality gender or reproduction Social issues spurred a partisan realignment  changing who considered themselves Democrats and Republicans Over decades socially conservative workingclass whites migrated from the Democratic Party  join the Republican Party especially in the South Socially moderate Republicans especially on the East Coast shifted  the Democratic coalitionThe result in Linds view is an emerging Republican Party dominated workingclass whites based in the South and West and suburbs and exurbs everywhere They will favor universal contribury social insurance systems that benefit them and their families and reward work effort  programs like Social Security and Medicare But they will tend  oppose meanstested programs for the poor whose benefits they and their families cannot enjoyThis shift Lind points out will powerfully alter the Democratic coalition o The Democrats will becomeeven more of an alliance of upscale progressive whites with blacks and Latinos based in large and diverse cities They will think of the US as a version of their multicultural coalition of distinct racial and ethnic identity groups writ large Many younger progressives will take it for granted that moral people are citizens of the world equating nationalism and patriotism with racism and fascismFrom this vantage point Trump and the prosocial insurance populist right that has emerged in much of Europe are as much the result of the vacuum created  traditional liberal political parties as they are a function of the neglect of working class interests  conservativesYou can look at the populist insurgency spearheaded  Donald Trump as either a corrective or a threat  mainstream Republican orthodoxyOn

middleclass voters  precisely the voters who had originally flocked  Wallace and then  Nixon who had been attracted  Perot and Buchanan but who now felt that they had found a champion in Trump He had

traditional sex roles for women and men over more fluid gender identities and roles and traditional over progressive valuesI asked Judis and Norris whether the Trump campaign provides a model for a

Citizens United The European right does not have strong business supportNorris looks at another angle the way in which the populist right is at its core a protest movement that is not well equipped

well as arguing for the benefits of global trade agreements with help for displaced workersHeres the problem with that agenda As both Judis and Norris stress the antiimmigrant message has been crucial  the growth of the European right and  the Trump campaignIn Europe Judis writes in his bookas populist parties gained support for their stand against immigration they widened their political base The first populist parties such as the National Front and the Freedom Party had been petitbourgeoisie parties Their members were drawn primarily from small wns in the countryside and were small business propriers and small farmers Thanks  the reaction  immigration and neoliberalism what had been petitbourgeois parties had become workers partiesJudis defines neoliberalism this wayIn the United States neoliberalism meant the modification but not wholesale abandonment of New Deal liberalism  support for the New Deal safety net but beyond that priority  market imperatives  while in Europe it meant

intellectuals  idea that somehow the GOP is going  start responding  the economic security worries of blue collarlower middle class Republicans is largely a fantasy And that is largely because the core of Trumps support is raw nativismIn the long run then the significance of the Trump campaign may well prove  be the changes he has wrought in the Democratic PartyAs Trump flails in every selfdestructive fashion conceivable the odds increasingly point  a Clinn vicry But if she wins how well will Clinn be able  govern with a base split between the welldo many of whom seek  protect their

Talk about an Ocber surprise The post on Twitter warning of a government conspiracy  swing the presidential election in the Democrats favor popped up just moments after the Labor Department reported the biggest monthly decline in the unemployment rate in nine yearsUnbelievable jobs numbersthese Chicago guys will do anything it said referring  the Obama administrations crew Cant debate so change numbersMr Welch later admitted that he had no evidence that any numbers had been cooked  only that the reported improvements did not match his own observations of the economySuch suspicions about even the routine dayin and dayout economic statistics produced  the federal government voiced  a scattershot of skeptics in previous years have turned in a steady roar this campaign seasonPeople dont know where these figures come from they dont know what they mean Professor Kahan said They just have an emotional yay or boo response  them and anything else that they recognize as having a political significanceEarlier this year Mr Trump said Dont believe those phony numbers contending that the jobless rate was probably 28 29 as high as 35 In fact I even heard recently 42 percent More recently he declared the official 5 percent jobless rate one of the biggest hoaxes in American modern politicsBy affirming that view Trump supporters are in effect signaling Im with himSo how reliable is the government data on employment which will be reported again on Friday Like all statistical measurements it can be both honest and imprecise a best estimate given the available ols but nonetheless subject  ambiguity misinterpretation and errorEvery data collection comes with a set of strengths and weaknesses said Karen Kosanovich an economist and 24year veteran of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Thats part of the business of collecting informationThere are some basic ground rules however that prevent the process from spitting out any answers you please and undermine claims that the results are rigged for a political purposeFor starters the people who generate the numbers are all career civil servants who have churned out reports for both Republicans and Democrats And their basic methods do not swerve from one administration  the next If the figures are biased they are consistently biased in the same way regardless of what party is in officeIve never had any outside influence that tells me what  do or how  collect and interpret information Ms Kosanovich said Our approach is based on methodologies that have been proven over time and approved statistical practices They are not based on political influenceThe most common misconception among the public Ms Kosanovich said is that the unemployment rate is determined solely  counting people who are receiving unemployment insurance benefits That is not the caseRather it is based on what is known as the Current Population Survey a monthly survey of 60000 households or about 110000 individuals from all around the country By comparison most respected public opinion polls depend on a random sample of 1000  2000 peopleIn general anyone who reports working for pay  even just an hour  during the previous week is considered employed Anyone who was laid off or actively looked for work sending out rsums responding  helpwanted ads during the previous four weeks regardless of whether they received any government benefits is considered unemployed People who are not looking  this includes millions of students enrolled in college plenty of parents who are happy  stay home with young children and millions more retirees  are not counted as being in the labor forceTo estimate how many jobs were created and lost the labor bureau each month gathers data from 146000 private business and government agencies covering about 623000 work sites throughout the countrySo what gives the best picture of the job market That depends The survey of employers started in a barebones form more than a century ago is considered a more reliable measure than the household survey in part because the sample size is much larger But it does not pick up all the types of jobs the selfemployed unpaid family workers domestic help and agricultural workers or answer questions about workers race ethnicity age and educational level The household survey helps fill in those gapsThe official jobless rate comes from the household survey and represents the number of people who are 1 in the labor force and 2 unemployed In September that was 79 million Americans out of the 160 million in the labor force or 5 percentMany economists however consider the official unemployment rate  be an inadequate gauge of what people are experiencing It does not take in account people who are working only part time because they cannot find a fulltime job Or the former steelworker who after years of fruitless searching has given up looking but would take a job if he could find oneMr olsbee called this a kind of invisible unemployment and noted that underreporting unemployment has served the interests of both political partiesSince then concerns about the shrinking size of the labor force have sharpened The proportion of Americans officially in the labor force has failed  recover significantly after taking a steep dive during the recession In 2008 about 66 percent of the population was actively looking or working now less than 63 percent isJust because people left the work force out of discouragement doesnt mean theyre not available for work said Patrick J OKeefe direcr of economic policy at CohnReznick and a former deputy assistant secretary in the Labor Department It just means the economy is not generating sufficient jobs at sufficient pay levels  get them back inPositive or negative spin however is not part of the Labor Departments brief Ms Kosanovich said She repeated a comment made  Kathleen Utgoff a former Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner appointed  George W Bush that serves as the agencys unofficial

The clearest pattern is simply that Trump has regained ground since Clinns postconvention peakWith the odds now favoring a narrow Clinn vicry what would the ramifications be after Nov 8 if she beats Trump  three or fewer percentage pointsIn fact the idea of the paranoid style as a force in politics would have little contemporary relevance or hisrical value if it were applied only  men with profoundly disturbed minds It is the use of paranoid modes of expression  more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significantThe paranoia of the Trump campaign has found expression in the accusation that the Republican establishment in the primaries and now Hillary Clinn and her allies in the general election are committed  rigging the vote  prevent Trumps rightful accession  the White HouseI won South Carolina I won it  a landslide like a massive landslide and now theyre trying  pick off those delegates one  one Thats not the way democracy is supposed  work And you know they offer them trips They offer them all sorts of things And youre allowed  do that And youre allowed  offer trips and you can buy all these votes What kind of a system is this Now Im an outsider and I came in the system And Im winning the votes  millions of votes But the system is rigged Its crookedBig business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place They are throwing money at her because they have tal control over everything she does She is their puppet and they pull the stringsIts easy  see why Hofstadter describes the paranoid style asmade up of certain preoccupations and fantasies the megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect wholly good abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers  the adversaryTrumps strongest supporters do in fact feel abominably persecuted They are unlikely  fade away gracefullyA narrow Trump loss could be problematic in that some significant percentage of Republican activists would believe Trumps claims that the elecral system was rigged against himThis is a potentially dangerous outcome for the country Masket addedMasket is not the only one worrying that the legitimacy of the election  and potentially of future elections  could be compromisedNorman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute warned that if the outcome is a close win for Hillary ClinnIt will reinforce the view among Trump populists that the election was slen and he was stabbed in the back which will make the task of party leaders that much harder while creating further delegitimization of the processI think we have widespread voter fraud but the first thing that Trump needs  do is begin talking about it constantlySnes advice was that Trump should sayI am leading in Florida The polls all show it If I lose Florida we will know that theres voter fraud If theres voter fraud this election will be illegitimate the election of the winner will be illegitimate we will have a constitutional crisis widespread civil disobedience and the government will no longer be the governmentThe TrumpSne message is resonatingUS intelligence and law enforcement agencies are probing what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States  sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in US political institutionsMasket believes that a spreading suspicion among Trump supporters that the election outcome was fixed could have severe repercussions after Nov 8Part of the reason that our nation has been relatively free of political violence is that losers of contests have nearly always accepted their loss and opposed the vicr through legitimate means such as challenging them in future elections or working against their agenda in Congress The 2000 election was very close and obviously very controversial but Al re nonetheless conceded after the Supreme Courts ruling Were Trump and his supporters  continue  argue that the election had been slen from them it would mean that they reject nonviolent solutions  political differences It could jeopardize future elections undermine the legitimacy of the federal government and create an environment in which political violence becomes more likelyHes certainly creating a movement that will continue independently of him even if he does fold at some pointIf Trump continues  be a focal point for altright ideas those voters will demand a voice either in the Republican Party or outside it Can the conservative and mainstream Republicans unite effectively and keep the altright from steering the partyThe conviction that Democrats and the Washingn establishment will rig the election in Clinns favor is  no means limited  the altright Newt Gingrich the former House speaker and Rudy Giuliani the former mayor of New York have both promoted the ideaI mean if you assume that she is a crook as he says if you assume that she lies as he says why would you expect her  have an honest electionFrankly we think that the situation in the country  just like with the Democratic National Committees primaries  is a situation where if youre relying on the Justice Department  ensure the security of the elections we have  be worriedIn the New Jersey election in 2004 3611691 votes were cast and there were eight substantiated cases

Perhaps the central situation conducive  the diffusion of the paranoid tendency is a confrontation of opposed interests which are or are felt  be tally irreconcilable and thus  nature not susceptible  the normal political processes of bargain and compromiseHofstadter wrote that at a time when polarization was a minor facr in politics The confrontation of irreconcilably opposed interests is far more hostile day which Hofstadter foresaw with such focused intensity that it is worth quoting him at lengthThe situation becomes worse when the representatives of a particular social interest  perhaps because of the very unrealistic and unrealizable nature of its demands  are shut out of the political process Having no access  political bargaining or the making of decisions they find their original

Each in its own way the Trump administration the Republican Senate and the Republican House face ideological conflicts between fiscal conservatism white identity politics and rightwing populismTheir interests converge in a shared antipathy  immigration and  programs seen as disproportionately benefiting racial and ethnic minorities Its when their interests diverge that battles eruptThe number of whites dependent on safety net programs is far larger than the number of African Americans at 28 million or Hispanics at 24 millionThe second case in point Trumps support of the legislation endorsed  Paul Ryan the speaker of the House  repeal and replace ObamacareThe voters hit the hardest  eligible for at least 5000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan  supported Mr Trump  a margin of 59 percent  36 percentAt the Boys and Girls Club in this rural city in southern Oklahoma the direcr is unsure how he will stay open if President Trumps proposed budget goes through eliminating money for several staff positionsSimilar conversations are happening at the Oklahoma Shakespearean Festivals afterschool arts program which relies on National Endowment for the Arts grants that Trump wants  eliminate And at the county senior center which already lost its state funding and could lose all or most of its federal funding o And at the Farm Service Center which supports 1200 local producers and is staffed with employees whose positions were targeted in the budgetThe predicament facing white conservatives is that after the enactment of civil rights laws they have found it difficult if not impossible  structure programs  benefit the white working class and poor without also benefiting disadvantaged AfricanAmericans and HispanicsUntil now the Tea Partyera Republican response has been  press for across the board cuts in safety net programsRather than instituting new programs or terminating old ones this strategy involved paring at the margins Rules for access eligibility and benefits were tightened up and adjusted  they write often through bureaucratic decisions kept out of the political limelightAs a rule policies like these sellended the countrys only cash entitlement program for poor families with children replacing it with a fixedbudget stateadministered program that offers lifetimelimited cash assistance  some but not all needy families and requires recipients  participate in work activity as a condition of receiptThat law is a case study in the effort  take benefits away from the supposedly undeserving poor With the passage of his Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act Clinn became the first twoterm elected Democrat  serve in the White House since Franklin RooseveltFiscal conservatism can use policy design  force retrenchment that favors white voters over minority voters Changes like these are frequently masked in bureaucratic languageIn the realm of social spending Trump has positioned himself on the side of fiscal conservatives On infrastructure however he and Bannon who just lost his seat on the National Security Council are on a different track They are pledged  an immense public works agenda generating jobs that would be appealing and available  white and nonwhite working class voters  hardcore budget hawks be damnedThe voters spoke with a thunderclap Trump squashed his 16 GOP rivals  a group that was uted as the most talented field of contenders in modern hisry  as if they were bugs crashing in his windshield Republican voters opted for his new breed of economic populismMoore continuedA realignment occurred while all the highfalutin intellectuals and political consultants were nappingJust as Trump in his business and personal life has demonstrated a dogged willingness  bet the house  without inhibition and with limited forethought  he is now embarking on one last enormous and divisive wager In this case however the house he is betting is not just his It belongs  all of usCollapse,politics
At noon on Friday Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States Millions of Americans will rejoice at the sight and millions more will not As a rule foreign leaders dont attend the inauguration of American presidents but Russias president Vladimir Putin will be there in spirit To understand why and  understand whats happening as Trump takes over the White House we need  go back two weeksordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election Russias goals were  undermine public faith in the US democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinn and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian vernment developed a clear preference for Presidentelect TrumpThe intelligence assessment raises the question what made Trump an attractive vehicle through which  attempt  weaken the liberal democratic order Why himTrump has flouted the norms of American elections and governance at every turn including calling for the jailing of an opposing candidate encouraging violence against protesters endorsing the rture of prisoners suggesting he might not respect the results of the election falsely claiming that millions of illegal votes were cast failing  resolve unprecedented conflicts of interest or  even disclose his tax returns and attacking a federal judge based on his ethnicity and thats of course a highly incomplete list I cant directly assess the IC report but its fair  say that the liberal democratic order is being disrupted both in the US and around the worldincendiary talk is an affront  elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse Krauthammer added It takes decades centuries  develop ingrained norms of political restraint and selfcontrol But they can be undone in short order  a demagogue feeding a vengeful populismNorman Ornstein a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute sent me his thoughtsOne the Russians have known for a long time that Trump was susceptible  flattery especially from major authority figures Two he had a significant following in the US as a megacelebrity Three if he got engaged in politics it would be divisive  a good early example being his birther efforts Four he would perplex frustrate and divide Republican establishment figures most of whom were hostile  Russia but a divided major party serves  disrupt the democracy I doubt they thought he would win but he would encourage or exacerbate divisions in the society challenge many fundamental norms over his own narcissistic sociopathic views of himself and his entitlements and break a lot of crockery without a seconds misgiving His vicries with the GOP nomination and the election were unexpected icing on the cakeOne of our conclusions was that the Kremlin seeks out political and economic forces which weaken the Wests desirability credibility and moral authority It does this  make Russias neighbors less interested in seeking  cooperate and integrate with Europe or the US making them more dependent on Russia It seeks  undermine NATOs unity in the hopes of seeking a new grand bargain with the US in which the US will recognize Russias sphere of influence and will not interfere in its internal issuesConley continuedAgainst this backdrop during the presidential campaign Mr Trump was the only candidate that openly questioned Americas commitment  NATO and its commitment  defend the Baltic States He was the only candidate who was not very critical of Russias actions in Ukraine and Syria and chose  reframe them in ways that were in sync with Russian policy He has proposed a new relationship with Russia In other words based on Mr Trumps statements his views appear  align with Russian interestsThere are those who dispute the conclusions of the governments intelligence reportInstead of wasting more time debating the contents of the report Applebaum wrote on Jan 13 maybe we ought  abandon our obsession with secrets and spies and look at what is sitting in front of usHere is Applebaums caseFirst Trumps real estate empire relies though we dont know how much on Russian moneySecond Applebaum writesFourthFinally Applebaum argues as evidence of Trumps proRussia tilt thatTrump is willing  risk serious conflict with China  destroy US relations with Mexico  dismiss Americas closest allies in Europe and  downgrade NATO our most important military allianceAll this provides the basis for Applebaums conclusionTrump doesnt have  be a Manchurian candidate who has been hypnotized or recruited  foreign intelligence Its enough that he has direct and indirect links  a profoundly corrupt and violent foreign dictar whose policies he admires whose advisers he shares and whose slogans he uses Thats kompromat enough for meMany of the domestic and foreign policy experts I contacted suggested that Russia would not need  blackmail Trump  get what it wanted  that Trumps susceptibility  praise has made him vulnerable  manipulationDavid Leege a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame wrote meTrump was a willing but unwitting accomplice because he loved the flattery saw it only as a business opportunity and had so little understanding of international relations  recognize how affairs of state could be caught up in itAlong similar lines Sandy Maisel a political scientist at Col argued that Trumpsego is such that he never asked nor does he ask yet what playing in the Russians needs and desires meant for our system An unwitting  egodriven  ol of Putins goal  undermine faith in our system and in the Clinn candidacyGary Jacobson a political scientist at the University of California San Diego was outspoken in his response  my question asking why the Russians favored TrumpHis shameless mendacity narcissism authoritarian instincts inability  lerate opposition or criticism hostility  formal institutions and the media vast ignorance of foreign and domestic issues indifference  constitutional restraints and eagerness  whip up and exploit xenophobia and barely disguised racism We might add his affection for authoritarian leaders and other ugh guys Have I left anything out Probably All of these characteristics lead him  say things and propose actions antithetical  democratic norms and standardsPutin sees in Trump someone who is enormously susceptible  flattery which Putin is perfectly happy  provide in order  achieve his national objectivesPutins major objective Wertheimer wrote  email is break up the Western alliance and he appears  see Trump as an excellent vehicle  achieve this goalVladimir Putin has seized the momentum of this unraveling exacting critical damage  the underpinnings of the liberal world order in a shockingly short timeThis threat McKew warns should not be taken lightlyThe West is already at war whether it wants  be or not It may not be a war we recognize but it is a war This war seeks at home and abroad  erode our values our democracy and our institutional strength  dilute our ability  sort fact from fiction or moral right from wrong and  convince us  make decisions against our own best interestsSpecific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals but in the longer term kompromat serves the interests of the powerful which is why it is often a ol of aucrats By eroding the very idea of a shared reality and  spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns  distrust leaders and institutions alike kompromat undermines a societys ability  hold the powerful  account and ensure the proper functioning of governmentMr Trumps version of reality got a boost There was no such thing as truth only a battle of opinions proffered  different acrs each of whom strives  be loudestThis means that we are facing the prospect of a renegade commander in chief armed with the considerable powers of the executive branch and a seemingly compliant legislature Trump has already dealt a body blow  the political process We will soon learn how much harm he can inflict once in officeCollapse,politics

But thanks  Mr Trumps own actions the cloud darkened considerably on Thursday and now seems likely  hover over his presidency for months if not years  comeRather than relieve the pressure Mr Trumps decision  fire Mr Comey has generated an even bigger political and legal threat In his anger at Mr Comey for refusing  publicly disclose that the president was not personally under investigation legal experts said Mr Trump may have actually made himself the target of an investigationJames B Comey the former FBI direcr testified before the Senate Intelligence CommitteeBut Mr Comey also revealed that he had turned over memos of his conversations with Mr Trump  that newly appointed special counsel Robert S Mueller III suggesting that investigars may now be looking in whether Mr Trump obstructed justice  dismissing the FBI direcrThis was a devastating day for the Trump White House and when the hisry of the Trump presidency is written this will be seen as a key moment said Peter H Wehner who was White House adviser  President George W Bush My takeaway is James Comey laid out facts and was essentially encouraging Mueller  investigate Trump for obstruction Thats a huge dealThe White House was left in the awkward position of trying  minimize the damage Mr Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent while his advisers kept the daily briefing off camera and sent out the backup  Sean Spicer the press secretary I can definitively say the president is not a liar Sarah Huckabee Sanders the principal deputy press secretary ld reportersWashingn has not seen a spectacle quite like this since the days of Watergate Irancontra or President Bill Clinns impeachment Whatever the controversies under Mr Bush and President Barack Obama neither was ever accused of personal misconduct  a current or former law enforcement official in such a public forumIndeed Mr Comey highlighted the difference  noting that he had never taken notes of his conversations with either of those presidents because he trusted their basic integrity but he did write memos about each of his oneonone encounters with Mr Trump because I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meetingIn any other presidency the events laid out  Mr Comey  Mr Trump asking for loyalty from the FBI direcr who was investigating the presidents associates then asking him  drop an investigation in a former aide and ultimately firing him when he did not  might have spelled the endBut Mr Trump has tested the boundaries of normal politics and upended the usual rules To his supporters the inquiries are nothing more than the elite news media and political establishment attacking a change agent who threatens their interestsThis is like an explosive presidencyending moment said John Q Barrett a law professor at St Johns University in New York and an associate independent counsel during the Irancontra investigation in Ronald Reagans presidency But we have a different context nowThe articles of impeachment drafted against President Richard M Nixon and Mr Clinn both alleged obstruction of justice in effect making clear that such an action could qualify under the high crimes and misdemeanors clause of the Constitution The smoking gun tape that doomed Mr Nixon in 1974 recorded him ordering his chief of staff  have the CIA block the FBI from investigating the Watergate burglary Critics said that Mr Trumps comments  Mr Comey effectively cut out the middle manThe House impeached Mr Clinn in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice  cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky a former White House intern during a sexual harassment lawsuit The obstruction alleged in Mr Clinns case was persuading Ms Lewinsky  give false testimony advising her  hide gifts he had given her  avoid any subpoena and trying  find her a job  keep her happy After a trial the Senate acquitted himAs a political matter both Mr Nixon and Mr Clinn faced a House under control of the opposition party while Mr Trump has the benefit of a Republican House that would be far less eager  open an impeachment inquiry And for all of the fireworks on Thursday the reaction in Congress still broke down largely along partisan lines with Democrats in attack mode and Republicans either defending Mr Trump or remaining silent That may leave the question  Mr MuellerThe polarization seems even worse than during the Lewinsky investigation which I hadnt thought possible said Stephen Bates an associate independent counsel during the investigation in Mr Clinn Everyone gets judged in terms of helping or hurting Trump Whatever Mueller does half of the country will call him courageous and half will call him contemptible We just dont know which half is whichWhat you need  know  start your day delivered  your inbox

Comey for leaking details of his conversations with the president  prompt the appointment of a special counsel although they were not classified It is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue  be those in government who are actively attempting  undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications he said Mr Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakersTellingly the Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee paid no heed  the talking points distributed in advance  the Republican National Committee at the behest of the White House Instead of attacking Mr Comeys credibility as the RNC and Donald Trump Jr did the Republican senars praised him as a patriot and dedicated public servant They largely accepted his version of events while trying  elicit testimony that would cast Mr Trumps actions in the most innocent light possibleMr Comey cooperated  some extent  trying not  go o far beyond the facts as he presented them declining for instance  say whether he thought Mr Trumps statements amounted  obstruction of justiceIn a credibility battle between Trump and Comey everybody knows Comey is going  win that war said Adam W ldberg who was an associate special White House counsel under Mr Clinn during Kenneth W Starrs investigationFor Mr Trump the battle with Mr Comey now overshadows much of what he wants  do Major legislation is stalled Mr Kasowitz said the president was eager  continue moving forward with his agenda with the business of this country and with the

How do Republicans hold on  the voters Donald Trump brought  the partySecuring the loyalty of the millions of white workingclass Americans who lined up behind Trump will require that all three wings of the Republican Party  its business faction its ideological purists and its cultural traditionalists  abandon any idea of strict adherence  core conservative principles on fiscal and social policyTrade and immigration are in my view unambiguously good for the country  but new policies on these issues will have  be done in ways that are supported  the American people not shoved down their throats  the elites In this regard I am a populist The elites in both parties have not undersod Trumpism and have often been contemptuous of the intellect and lifestyle of the Trump loyalistsMoore is not aloneThese voters have shunned Republicans because they disagree with the partys focus on low taxes small government and probusiness policies They benefit enormously from middleclass entitlement programs their children get what they consider  be good educations from public schools and state universities They have no problem with redistribution so long as it is focused on either people who cant work or people who doIn other words these voters have little or no interest in the antigovernment stance that had become reflexive among many congressional RepublicansAccommodation now requires fiscal business and social conservatives  compromise their beliefs in ways that will be wrenching if not inlerable  some Olsens assessmentThese voters view questions of public taxation and spending differently than do other factions in the party Where movement conservatives see many social programs and the high taxes that fund them as threats  liberty these voters see them as giving decent hardworking people a hand up  live decent dignified lives Where business conservatives see free trade or immigration as helping people and increasing growth these voters see those policies as favoring foreigners over themselves and as just another way that their bosses try  pay them less without justificationIn the case of cultural litmus test issues Olsen argues newly recruited white workingclass converts  Trumps Republican Party do not consider conservative dogma on gay rights abortion gender identity or traditional marriage their priorityIts everything related  jobs The conservatives are going  go crazy Im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan With negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity  rebuild everything Shipyards ironworks get them all jacked up Were just going  throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks It will be as exciting as the 1930s greater than the Reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movementBannon is explicit in his identification of the enemyThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia The issue now is about Americans looking  not get fed over If we deliver well get 60 percent of the white vote and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and well govern for 50 yearsTrump provided the voiceover which was taken from a speech he gave in West Palm Beach in OcberFor those who control the levers of power in Washingn and for the global special interests they partner with these people that dont have your good in mind The political establishment that is trying  sp us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dryThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our facries and our jobs as they flee  Mexico China and other countries all around the world Its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money in the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities The only thing that can sp this corrupt machine is you The only force strong enough  save our country is usThey once believed they were elected  advance a narrowly ideological agenda but Trumps success has given them reason  question that beliefAmong these archconservatives who in the past had been fanatical in their pursuit of ideological purity the realization that they can no longer depend on unfailing support from their constituents has provoked deep anxietyAs Alberta put itEven if they support Trump nine times of ten voting against him once could trigger a tweetsrm or the threat of a visit  their district Its a chilling thought for members who know that the Republican National Committee the National Republican Congressional Committee and the House GOP leadership already want them goneKevin McCarthy the House majority leader plans  make full use of Trumps leverage  keep recalcitrant members of the Freedom Caucus in lineMcCarthy pointed out that Trump probably did the best in the districts of caucus members andit would be hard for them  stand up if PresidentElect Trump is asking for this fundamental change and theyre saying no  itThe incendiary nature of identity issues has prompted the two leading candidates for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee Tom Perez and Keith Ellison  purposefully focus on anodyne concernsOur universal message of access  economic opportunity resonates with the ironworker in northeastern Ohio and the immigrant in South Florida Perez ld the Huffingn Post referring  two states Clinn lost We sometimes have a relationship deficit with our voters because were not communicating that messageAt this point the Democratic Party must be the party that delivers for working people We can do that  meeting folks where they are looking them in the eye treating them with respect and working  solve their problemsInstead of spending the final weeks of the campaign advancing a compelling economic message  show Clinn would bring change the campaign closed with a promise  fight for opportunity and  unite a multicultural America under the banner of being stronger getherWhats happening and this is ironic is that a movement with the goal of saving black lives at this point is getting black lives taken because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacksMcCarthy also pointed out that less than half of 1 percent of all the shootings in this city involve police officers shooting civiliansNor did McCarthy sp there He contended thatthe Trump election quite frankly is a reaction  that I think the people are tired of career politicians whove never really had a job telling us how we should think and how we should actIn late November such liberal icons as Bernie Sanders and President Obama cautiously broached the subject of identity politics On Nov 20 Sanders ld a group in BosnIts not good enough for someone  say Im a woman Vote for me No thats not good enough What we need is a woman who has the guts  stand up  Wall Street  the insurance companies  the drug companies  the fossil fuel industryThat same day Obama addressed reporters traveling with him in Lima PeruOne message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy thats just microtargeting particular discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections but its not going  win you the broad mandate that you needwe try  slice the elecrate up And we try  say Youre black youre brown youre gay youre straight youre a woman youre a man The reality of it is theres no juice in that kind of campaignThis thing where an obscure male backbencher thinks he deserves  replace the most accomplished woman in Congress is how sexism worksIf I see my party not considering even more intensely than theyve done in the past the economic social and political climate of the people I represent the people Ive been fighting for all my life then Im going  raise hellAt the moment the Democratic Party is structurally fragile and its members have shied away from the kind of radical upheaval Republicans have been forced  embrace Nonetheless Democrats will soon face enormously risky decisionsOr should the party edge ward the center attempting a strategic reposition on thorny issues of race immigration gender and identity in effect acknowledging pressures from the right  the very pressures that delivered crucial white votes  TrumpDemocrats face a vast unknown  unable  stand still and unable  make reasoned choices until they know  what lengths demonic or inspired Trump might goCollapse,politics
WASHINGTON  He has a reputation as a principled lawyer He has worked for both Republican and Democratic atrneys general He has a jugular instinct in courtroom battles but a distaste for political onesNow Rod J Rosenstein the deputy atrney general is confronting the political fight of his career Amid sustained criticism  President Trump and rumors that he will be fired Mr Rosenstein is also maneuvering  defuse demands  Republicans in Congress that Democrats say are aimed at ousting him from his job  and from his role as protecr of the special counsel Robert S Mueller IIISo far he appears  be succeeding But in trying  deflect those attacks some say Mr Rosenstein has risked eroding the Justice Departments hisric independence from political meddling The consequences could persist long after he and the rest of the Trump administration are out of powerA small but influential group of House Republicans has demanded greater access  sensitive documents related  some of the FBIs most politically charged investigations in the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinns handling of classified emails Should Mr Rosenstein fail  comply they have threatened  subpoena him hold him in contempt of Congress or even impeach himThe Republicans complain that Mr Rosenstein and other Justice Department officials have slowwalked or outright snewalled their requests for reams of documents and other information they need  conduct oversight When they do receive documents they say o many are showing up with critical content blacked outThis is serious stuff said Representative Jim Jordan a conservative Ohio Republican allied with Mr Trump who voiced his complaints in a recent meeting with Mr Rosenstein We as a separate and equal branch of government are entitled  get the informationMr Rosenstein 53 has staved off his attackers on Capil Hill largely  appeasing them Two weeks ago he allowed key Republican legislars  review an almost completely unredacted FBI memo on the opening of a still active investigation of the Trump campaign a rare step He later summoned two other Republicans Mr Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina  his office  pledge that the Justice Department would be more responsive  their requestsBut still other Republican demands remain unmet and Democrats have warned that Mr Rosenstein is being boxed in a corner where he has  choose between saving his job and setting disturbing precedents that chip away at the independence that the Justice Department has maintained since President Richard M Nixon tried  thwart the Watergate investigation That independence keeps the country from sliding in a banana republic said Matthew Miller a former Justice Department spokesman under Atrney General Eric H Holder JrStephen E Boyd the Justice Departments assistant atrney general for legislative affairs said The department is responding  what it believes  be good faith requests for information pursuant  Congresss appropriate oversight function and the department is doing so in a way that will not have any adverse impact on ongoing investigationsOthers said they worried that in solving his shortterm political problems Mr Rosenstein could expose the department  increasingly onerous congressional demands in continuing investigations  an area that has traditionally been off limitsIt could become an exception that swallows the rule said Senar Richard Blumenthal Democrat of Connecticut and a former federal prosecur Every request  Congress can be made  seem exceptionalIn one of Washingns odder embraces their strongest defenders are congressional Democrats who abhor the Justice Departments policies under the Trump administration but see Mr Rosenstein as a firewall between the president and the special counselMr Rosenstein declined requests for an interview but supporters say he is well positioned  defend himself A careful and conservative lawyer he is unlikely  make missteps or overstep boundaries they say A highranking former Justice Department official described him as the ultimate survivorEarly in his tenure he stumbled when he wrote a memo  Mr Sessions castigating Mr Comey for speaking publicly about the FBI investigation in Mrs Clinns handling of classified information while secretary of state Although Mr Trump has repeatedly cited it as justification for firing Mr Comey Mr Rosenstein ld Congress that the memo was not meant  justify a forcause termination Even so he acknowledged that he knew Mr Comeys job was in danger when he wrote itRod got suckered  the president in writing the memo said Philip B Heymann a former Justice Department official and one of Mr Rosensteins menrs Trump marched his deputy atrney general way out on a limb and then left him thereHe and others suggest that Mr Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller as special counsel partly  redeem himself That was the only way Rod could show he was not a lackey that he was neutral Mr Heymann saidMr Sessions has scant ability  provide his deputy cover If the president is mulling Mr Rosensteins fate he holds a deeper animus ward Mr Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigationMr Rosenstein addresses his own jeopardy with a blend of sicism and black humor according  friends I may need  talk  you about a job he jested  one Washingnarea lawyerHe is not however trying  whip up political support for himself He doesnt do the selfpreservation game said James M Trusty a friend who worked with him in Maryland Hes very grounded and fatalistic He plays it  the bookMr Rosenstein is proceeding as though he will not be fired On Monday he is arguing a sentencing guidelines case on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme CourtMr Rosenstein grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1989 He became a trial lawyer in the Justice Departments public integrity section in Washingn and eventually worked with Kenneth W Starr the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinns business dealings In 2005 President George W Bush appointed him the United States atrney for Maryland President Barack Obama kept him onThe office he ran had been rn apart  political infighting and had a weak relationship with local law enforcement In his first few months Mr Rosenstein gathered information from employees about what had gone wrong then restructured the office He reached out  state prosecurs and encouraged his staff members  work with them  fight violent crime His ability  transcend politics gave him credibility according  many who worked with himI never heard a political word escape from his lips said Brian E Frosh the Democratic Maryland atrney general He was smart honest fair ugh  everything you want in a prosecurMr Sessions barely knew Mr Rosenstein when he became his deputy and Mr Rosenstein had no obvious political patron He was not expecting  become a household name When his daughter asked whether his new job meant that he was now famous he ld her that few people know or care who served as deputy atrney generalHe and Mr Sessions had little in common beyond their lengthy tenures as federal prosecurs and shared views on gangs drugs and violent crime And the tensions that almost always exist between atrneys general and their deputies have been exacerbated  the special counsel investigation and the resulting political pressuresBut associates say the men have bonded in the face of attacks from the White HouseAfter Mr Trump publicly exploded against Mr Rosenstein this month Mr Sessions called Donald F McGahn II the White House counsel  warn that firing the deputy atrney general would have damaging consequences including the possible resignation of Mr Sessions himself according  a person briefed on the conversationMr Sessions ld Mr McGahn that the president needed  know that he believed that firing Mr Rosenstein would be a misstep and that he had done nothing  justify such an ousterMr Rosensteins oversight of the special counsels office gives him broad powers  approve or ve Mr Muellers investigative requests Democrats and some Republicans worry that the president could fire Mr Rosenstein and install a replacement who would use that power  narrow the scope of the special counsels inquiryDemocratic senars have circulated a document arguing that a new deputy atrney general could deny Mr Mueller the power  take investigative steps and decline  sign off on staff or resources essentially undermining the investigation without officially ending it or prompting the kind of Republican backlash on Capil Hill that firing Mr Mueller almost certainly would A new appointee could also refuse  publicly release a report when Mr Muellers investigation concludesAt the same time the presidents staunchest supporters on Capil Hill have put themselves in one standoff after another with Mr Rosenstein Among others he has faced escalating demands and complaints from three committee chairmen Representatives Robert W odlatte of the Judiciary Committee Devin Nunes of the Intelligence Committee and Trey wdy of the Oversight CommitteeIn a separate request Mr odlatte and others have issued a subpoena for hundreds of thousands of documents  an extraordinary number even for Congress  related  the Clinn inquiry the firing of the FBIs former deputy direcr and other matters When the lawmakers began complaining that the documents were coming slowly and with o much content blacked out the Justice Department appointed a United States atrney in Illinois  oversee document review and production The FBI doubled the number of employees working on responses  a request for materials the Justice Departments inspecr general was using  54 people working two shifts a day from 8 am  midnightBut some Republicans are still unsatisfied and have said a contempt citation or even impeachment  exceedingly rare steps that would require votes in the House  are still possibilities Democrats fear that taken gether the Republican requests are meant  offer Mr Trump cover or even cause  fire Mr RosensteinIn a meeting with Mr Rosenstein in recent days Mr Jordan and Mr Meadows tried  impress upon him that they needed the documents they sought Otherwise Mr Meadows said later lawmakers would be left with no choice but  begin building a case  hold Mr

There was little  indicate that Mr Amos 39 was a danger  anyone but himself that day He was arrested unarmed outside the church in need of treatment and counseling according  his lawyer Fred Tiemann Police recovered the pisl from the buildingFederal prosecurs citing Mr Amoss conviction of felony robbery as an adult at age 15 instead charged him with illegally possessing a firearm He pleaded guilty in November and is serving a threeyear sentence in federal prisonUrged  Atrney General Jeff Sessions  punish offenders as harshly and as quickly as possible federal prosecurs have increasingly pursued lowlevel gun possession cases according  law enforcement officials and an examination of court records and federal crime statistics Mr Amoss conviction was part of the Justice Departments broad crackdown on gun violence during the first 15 months of the Trump administrationMr Sessions is putting in action his own longheld views on criminal justice forged as a United States atrney in Alabama during the drug war They reflect a philosophy popular among conservatives and long backed  the gun lob that the effective enforcement of existing laws can reduce crime without resorting  the passage of additional legislationMr Sessionss approach has uched off a debate about whether he is making the country safer from violent crime as he and President Trump have repeatedly vowed  do or devoting resources  lowlevel prosecutions that could instead be put ward pursuing bigger targets like gun suppliersIts a good idea  enforce the existing gun laws said Avery Gardiner copresident of The Brady Campaign a nonprofit coalition that works  combat gun violence Thats something prosecurs should do But going only after the people who are purchasing the guns illegally is only part of the sryLocal police who have for years sought more muscle from federal law enforcement welcomed Mr Sessionss more aggressive approachWe have been trying  send a message said J Thomas Manger president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association which represents police departments across the country The bad guys have a real fear of federal prosecutions versus state prosecutionsPenalties for federal gun convictions are steep On average firearms defendants spend six years in federal prison If they are convicted under the two statutes requiring mandary minimum sentences that average jumps  11 yearsThree law enforcement officials described a newfound interest among prosecurs in taking on smaller gun cases  referred  in law enforcement parlance as oneman onegun cases for their narrow impact Such cases had long been left  state and local prosecurs freeing Justice Department officials  focus on broader investigations of interstate gun trafficking and criminal networksOn Jan 1 2017 police in York Pa spped Steven Gray 46 whom they said was carrying a pisl Mr Gray was charged in federal court last April with illegally possessing the firearm which he denied was his A forensic investigation  the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives found no discernible DNA on the weapon Mr Gray who had a prior felony drug charge was convicted and faces up  10 years in prison when he is sentenced in the coming monthsSometimes it appears theyre just looking for numbers his lawyer Thomas Thornn said of federal prosecurs who denied the accusationOur efforts are not about numbers said David Freed the United States atrney for the Middle District of Pennsylvania We are focused on reducing violent crime and protecting lawabiding citizensBut few law enforcement officials want  make a priority of prosecuting lowlevel offenders one said describing simmering concern that the pressure from Mr Sessions will lead prosecurs  prioritize conviction tals over their impact on crimeWhen Mr Tiemann sought leniency for his client prosecurs pointed  Mr Sessionss policy he said telling him that they were now required  pursue the most serious charge and the most serious punishment available Prosecurs initially sought  charge Mr Amos with an offense that carried a sentence of up  15 years before settling on a lesser charge Mr Tiemann saidRichard W Moore the United States atrney for the Southern District of Alabama which prosecuted the case said Mr Amoss conviction record speaks for itselfConsistent with Department of Justice policy we charge and pursue the most serious readily provable offense said Mr MooreSupporters of Mr Sessionss initiatives acknowledge the politics of his approach and remain wary it could be used  sap energy from further legislative or regulary efforts  combat gun violence like regulating assault weapons or increasing background check requirementsWe certainly are hoping for some additional legislative fixes  Congress Mr Manger saidIt is difficult  judge the impact of Mr Sessionss initiatives Many offenders charged with federal gun laws in 2017 are just now going  trial or being sentenced and some of the cases could still be moved out of the federal systemFederal firearm prosecutions have hisrically ebbed and flowed often spiking in the years following significant court decisions or largescale mass shootings After steadily dropping since 2004 prosecutions began increasing again in 2015 according  the TRAC databaseEnforcement isnt always the solution  those different types of crimes said Inimai Chettier direcr of the justice program at New York Universitys Brennan Center for Justice The result might be  increase the federal prison population without a correlating reduction in crimeAmid surging public pressure following the mass shooting at a Florida high school in February Mr Trump directed Mr Sessions  more strictly enforce existing gun laws Survivors of that shooting have pushed Mr Trump  ban assault weapons and raise the legal purchasing age for firearmsInstead prodded  Mr Trump Mr Sessions pushed federal prosecurs  more strictly enforce background check violations and ban bump scks a

HBO should be riding highAnd yet the premium cable channel is confronting two major headaches that have turned what should be a triumphant summer in an exhausting oneRoughly two weeks ago a hacker began releasing material slen from HBO in a cyberattack On Sunday another wave of material was released including unaired episodes of two anticipated fall series Curb Your Enthusiasm and The Deuce Though the material that has come out so far has not been damaging  HBO  there have been no embarrassing emails like there were in the attack that hit Sony in 2014  it has certainly been an irritant that has shown no sign of fadingAnd this weekends deadly rallies in Charlottesville Va also served  remind HBO that the public outcry over its recent announcement of a new alternatehisry drama called Confederate may linger for some timeAll of this is happening as HBOs parent company Time Warner is on the brink of a merger with ATTA backlash emerged with some accusing HBO of being cavalier with the pic of slavery and the contemporary plight of black life in the United States A social media campaign built around the hashtag NoConfederate began trending on TwitterThen came this weekends events in Charlottesville where a rally of white nationalists turned in a series a melees and a 32yearold woman was killed when a car sped in a crowd of counterprotesrsOne of the crears of the NoConfederate campaign April Reign who also created the OscarsSoWhite social media campaign said that the events over the weekend were a reminder that we have not fully reconciled what the Confederacy meansHow is this an althisry when we have things like Charlottesville playing out she said in a telephone interviewHBO defended the series in a statement on MondayWe support everybodys right  express an opinion but the suggestion of irresponsibility on our part is simply undeserved the network said HBO has a long hisry of championing intelligent srytelling and we will approach this project with the same level of thoughtfulness that has always defined our programming We recognize the sensitivity of this project and will treat it with the respect that it deserves Our creative partners should be given time  develop the series rather than face prejudgmentHBO said that Confederate would not go in production until Game of Thrones was finished next year meaning that it will probably be at least two years before the show is ready  airThe hacker who refers  himself as Mr Smith described this as the third wave of material So far the attack has remained relatively contained compared with the one involving Sony which included a trove of embarrassing and racially insensitive emails that forced the studios executives  publicly apologize and meet with civil rights activists HBO has said that it did not believe its email system as a whole had been breached though the hacker has had access  some emails and released a number from the account of one network executiveIn contrast the HBO hacker has primarily released the material  members of the news media and it is not clear how widely some of the hacked episodes have actually spread online Further the hacker has not released any upcoming episodes of Game of Thrones HBOs crown jewel which has two episodes left this seasonMr Smith has said that he wants HBO  pay him a ransom for the rest of the material On Monday the hacker provided a copy of a letter that he had purportedly sent  HBO You disappointed us so we will bring down your nasty empire it readHBO said in a statement that it was no longer in communication with the hacker and that it would not comment on every bit of material that was releasedThe hacker may continue  drop bits and pieces of slen information in an attempt  generate media attention the network said Thats a game were not going  participate in Obviously no company wants their proprietary information slen and released on the internet Transparency with our employees partners and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward This incident has not deterred us from ensuring HBO continues  do what we do bestBut it has contributed  an unexpectedly anxious summerCollapse,politics
The handhand political combat in House elections on Tuesday in Georgia and last week in Kansas had the feel of the first rounds of an epic battle next year for control of the House of Representatives and the direction of national politics as the Trump presidency unfoldsBut for all the zeal on the ground none of it may matter as much as a case heading  the Supreme Court one that could transform political maps from City Hall  Congress  often  Democrats benefitNow the Wisconsin case is headed  a Supreme Court that has repeatedly said that extreme partisan gerrymanders are unconstitutional but has never found a way  decide which ones cross the lineToday at a time of hyperpartisan politics and computer technology that can measure political leanings almost house  house Republicans control legislatures in 33 states 25 with Republican governors They have unfettered command over the boundaries of at least 204 congressional districts  amounting  nearly half the 435seat HousePartly because of the Voting Rights Act gerrymanders based on race are flatly illegal but ones based on partisan intent remain in limboIn North Carolina a June hearing is scheduled in a suit over the unabashedly partisan carving of the state in 10 Republican and three Democratic House seats  this in a state with more registered Democrats than RepublicansWisconsin Republican leaders say they dominate the Legislature because they have both a better strategy and vision of governing not because of illegal gerrymanderingIn a year when people want change even in a district that favors one party over another a good candidate with a good message wins said Robin Vos Wisconsins Assembly speakerBut the court said in November that the redistricting clearly aimed  entrench Republican control of the Assembly The party ok 60 of the Assemblys 99 seats in 2012 despite losing the popular vote and has since added three moreAs in all gerrymanders Wisconsins mapmakers hobbled their opponents in two ways One was  pack as many Democrats as possible in a few districts leaving fewer Democrats for potentially competitive ones In 2012 21 of the 39 Assembly districts that Democrats won were so lopsided that Republicans did not even field candidates In two more Democrats captured at least 94 percent of the voteThe other method was  fracture unwinnable Democratic districts salting their Democrats among Republicanmajority districts so that races there became closer yet remained out of Democrats reachThey just busted my district and put it in four or five others said Mark Radcliffe a 45yearold Democrat and former state representative whose district encompassed Alma Center in rural western Wisconsin Mr Radcliffe who wound up in the district of another Democrat chose  resign rather than run against a popular member of his own partyJohn Steinbrink another Democrat had represented southeastern Wisconsin in the Assembly since 1996 supported  a Democratic base in Kenosha six miles from where he farms corn and soybeans After redistricting Kenosha became a safe Democratic district and Mr Steinbrink was exiled  an adjoining district populated  rural conservatives In 2012 his Republican opponent won with 55 percent of the voteI could have moved  Kenosha and sought reelection there Mr Steinbrink said But I dont know how you farm in the cityThe legal argument against such maps is akin  the one used for decades  outlaw ethnic and racial gerrymanders Gerrymanders dilute a minority groups votes muffling its voice in the political process The Wisconsin plaintiffs argue that whether the minority group is AfricanAmericans or members of a political party makes no differenceBut while racial or ethnic gerrymanders can be statistically measured  a Latino remains a Latino from election  election  judges have struggled  identify overly partisan districts knowing voter sentiments can quickly changeThe Maryland lawsuit proposes a solution that some justices have pondered an argument that gerrymanders violate the First Amendment not the 14th  retaliating against opponents who express contrary views Under that standard any partisanshipinspired district would be unconstitutional if it hobbled a minority partyThe Wisconsin case underscores how modern gerrymanders using computers and political and behavioral data have become increasingly effective Measured  the efficiency gap four of the five most partisan state legislature maps in the last 45 years were drawn after 2010 said Nicholas O Stephanopoulos a University of Chicago law professor and lawyer for the plaintiffsIn the House of Representatives eight of the 10 most partisan maps were created after 2010 including Wisconsins and two in North CarolinaOne participant in the 2004 decision Justice Anthony M Kennedy may prove the fulcrum in the courts deliberations In that case he held out hope that the court could find a solution  extreme gerrymanders that political leaders were unable or unwilling  addressThe ordered working of our Republic and of the democratic process depends on a sense of decorum and restraint in all branches of government and in the citizenry itself he wrote thenIf the Wisconsin statistical standards do not persuade the justices other proposals are waiting in the wings But some worry that the debate may be close  hitting the brick wall it avoided in 2004If the court doesnt endorse some version of what the threejudge panel decided in Wisconsin said Ellen D Katz a University of Michigan scholar of election law then it may be theyre never going  find a standard theyre comfortable applyingAlain Delaqueriere Doris Burke Elisa Cho and Jack Begg contributed researchCollapse,politics
The Food IssueBy Jessica B HarrisIn 1908 Pablo Picasso and his close friend Guillaume Apollinaire a poet and an art critic decided  host a lavish dinner party for Henri Rousseau who was at the time a widely denigrated painter Picasso had recently purchased a Rousseau painting from a secondhand shop in Montmartre where the owner suggested that the portrait of a large woman was so bad it should be painted over But Picasso who bought it for 5 francs liked it in a twisted way It was so bad that it was good As a joke he and Apollinaire planned an overthep dinner  celebrate the douanier or cusms officer a nickname for Rousseau who had spent much of his life as a public servant The two sent invitations  a constellation of notable people  Georges Braque Juan Gris Max Jacob Marie Laurencin Gertrude and Leo Stein Alice B Toklas  summoning them  Picassos studio apartment in the Bateau Lavoir a decrepit green building that housed artistsBefore he received acclaim for his postImpressionist jungle scenes Rousseau then 64 was known as a shy bureaucrat who had retired from his job as a ll taker  devote himself  painting full time A familiar figure in the cafes and artists haunts of the Butte Montmartre he had paintings exhibited at the Salon des Indpendants an annual show put on  a famous painters association but his work was never prominently displayed His nave artistic style was more a source of ridicule than adulation from critics some of his paintings had even been slashed with penknives He supplemented his pension  playing violin on the streetThere are multiple versions of what happened that night and the srys embellishments have only grown in the years since Some say that Picasso gave the caterer the wrong day so Fernande Olivier Picassos mistress and model improvised a riz  la Valenciennes a rice dish made with chicken and seafood Others suggest that the meal was just an excuse for Olivier  try a paella recipe that she picked up during a recent trip  Spain Gertrude Stein was rumored  have wandered the local shops looking for lastminute cheeses and sardines All agreed that the meal was delicious The guest of honor arrived that night with his violin in one hand and his cane in the other and was soon feted with songs and a poetic ast loudly declaimed  Apollinaire with Braque accompanying the speech on his accordion These wines that in your honor Picasso poursLets drink them then since its the hour for drinkingCrying in unison Long live Long live Rousseau  Rousseau even obliged the crowd with some melodiesBy midnight the party had grown rowdier As the original seated dinner ended people in cafes and bars of the Butte heard rumors of the party and decided  join Frdric the owner of the Lapin Agile a near cafe appeared with his flatulent pet donkey Laurencin did a risqu dance for the crowd and then fell blind drunk on the pastries that were supposed  be served for dessert There may have been a brawl between the poets Andr Salmon and Maurice Cremnitz though they later claimed  have faked it At one point Rousseau delighted with the adulation is said  have gravely announced  Picasso You and I are the greatest painters I in the modern genre you in the Egyptian He left with the Steins in the wee hours of the morning The remaining guests slept on the floorDespite beginning as a joke the dinner is often credited with legitimizing Rousseau in the art world Picasso kept Portrait of a Woman even after Rousseaus death in 1910 once calling it one of the most truthful of all the French psychological portraits The painting is now in his collection in the Muse Picasso in ParisBy Bee WilsonLike any good soup a bowl of Louisiana gumbo can uplift you even when there is nothing  feel uplifted about On Sept 17 1960 a group of students in New Orleans three black and one white sat down at McCrorys whitesonly lunch counter and refused  leave until they were served The students were convicted of criminal mischief though that would be overturned  the Supreme Court in Lombard v Louisiana 1963 a key moment in the fight against segregation But before this hisric meal came another The sitin was organized few days earlier over spicy gumbo at Dooky Chases RestaurantGumbo makes people braver it satisfies the soul and gets you talking says Leah Chase the legendary AfricanAmerican chef of Creole cuisine who is still cooking at 94 Honey this is where they planned the thing she says over the phone from New Orleans her voice warm and musical She remembers the young activists who belonged  CORE  the Congress of Racial Equality  eating a series of lunches and dinners that September in her restaurants upstairs roomThe leader was Rudy Lombard 21 a fiery orar Also there were Cecil Carter Jr another black student Lanny ldfinch a white student and Oretha Castle a courageous black human rights campaigner whose mother Vergie was the bartender at Dooky Chase It was illegal at that time in the South for blacks and whites  eat in the same restaurant but this danger didnt deter the CORE students who often spoke of sacrificing their lives for the cause They shared seafood gumbo thickened with fil powder ground dried sassafras leaves fried chicken and Lombards favorite Italian salad of salami capers and olives with Lolis Edward Elie a local lawyer Over the food there were intense discussions about what they could and couldnt do  advance their cause within the law The activists asted their plans with glasses of Barqs root beer According  Chase When they were working they didnt drink so much as a bottle of beerIn 1960 Dooky Chase was one of the very few dining places in New Orleans where black people could eat with heavy cutlery on pressed linen tablecloths Growing up Lombard once ld a radio interviewer he dreamed of eating somewhere like that His mother worked as a cook for a rich family and she worked across the street from a fancy restaurant called Pascals Manale As a boy Rudy longed  eat there Chase gave him and the other CORE members a taste of that restaurant ease He once said he saw the restaurant as an incubar of black peoples aspirationsAnother activist who regularly ate there was Raphael Cassimere Jr an emeritus hisry professor at the University of New Orleans Cassimere remembers meetings of the NAACP whose office was a few blocks away where people got all steamed up but as soon as everyone was sitting down with Chases gumbo youd be laughing again This gumbo was like the food of Louisiana grandmothers Cassimere recalls except that you could get it 24 hours And it was cheap Sometimes in an extragenerous mood Chase didnt charge at all She fed many of the Freedom Riders who ok a series of perilous bus trips through the South in 1961 trying  use whitesonly restrooms and restaurants along the waySometimes the activists arrived at the restaurant dirty right out of jail Poor darlings she says I used  feel so sorry for them Chase sent them around the corner  Vergies home  take a bath And then she fed themBy Brenda WineappleIn 1884 James Gillespie Blaine a Republican senar from Maine ate a dinner that helped him lose the presidency Blaine is now nearly forgotten but during the Gilded Age he was a star candidate for the White House from 1876  1892 even when he didnt want the job  and despite the pungent whiff of financial scandal always trailing him Blaine Blaine the continental liar from the State of Maine opponents taunted him while diehard Blainiacs called him a gallant plumed knightWhatever Blaine was he had also been a speaker of the House a secretary of state and a man who liked  eat It was after all the period of the socalled Great Barbecue when politicians and financiers and railroad buccaneers all splurged gether whether on the public trust or on oysters and Champagne On Oct 29 just one week before Election Day when Blaine was poised  beat his Democratic opponent Grover Cleveland he accepted an invitation  a dinner in his honor at Delmonicos Restaurant in New York City Since 1837 the wealthy and the notable had eaten there Abraham Lincoln Napoleon III Jenny Lind and even Charles Dickens who despised American cuisine Delmonicos seemed  rebut singlehandedly the notion that American cooking as one hisrian put it insulted every sense but hearingThe Delmonico family knew all about farmtable they had bought over 200 acres in Brooklyn  grow fresh fruits and vegetables Regardless the restaurants bill of fare was resoundingly French Even the menu was written in it The name Delmonico came  symbolize luxury  and excess At one particularly extravagant banquet each woman discovered a gold bracelet folded in her napkin And at the James Blaine dinner while a full orchestra played patriotic tunes the 200 guests were seated at huge tables covered with white cloths tropical ferns and confections representing their occupations On Blaines table was a model White House apparently made of sugarBlaine never made it  the real White House The day after his banquet The Associated Press printed the elaborate menu along with the guest list which included the nations richest men millionaires like Andrew Carnegie John Jacob Asr and Jay uld who could afford a ninecourse meal and  implication a ninecourse president They supped on consomm  la Vicria or crme de volaille  la Berchoux before choosing kingfish  la Richelieu or

The devastating recession that began at the end of 2007 and officially ended in June 2009 was the most severe downturn since World War IIThe fact that people living outside big cities were battered so acutely  the recession goes a long way ward explaining President Trumps vicry in the last electionThe greater Los Angeles region  like other densely populated metropolitan areas such as Clark County which includes Las Vegas and Dallas County in Texas  recovered strongly and swiftly and supported the Democratic Party in Nov 2016 from candidates for local office  the presidentThe chart shows that since the botm of the recession in the fourth quarter of 2009 metropolitan areas have fully bounced back and are now significantly above their prerecession employment levels In contrast employment in nonmetro areas remains well below its prerecession levelFrom another vantage point Trump did best in regions where economic growth was the worst  where jobs are disappearing and where middleaged white men and women are dying at younger agesIn the period from 1992  1996 communities of 100000 or less were engines of growth producing 27 percent of the nations new jobs The large metropolitan areas with populations of over one million produced 16 percentBy 2010  2014 the share of new jobs in the lowest population counties shrank  9 percent while the share produced in the largest counties grew from 16  41 percentPut still another way counties with populations below one million have seen their share of job creation drop from 84 percent of the national tal in 199296  78 percent in 200206  and then abruptly plummet  59 percent in 201014The pattern of net new business creation new firms minus firms going out of business reveals an even sharper reversal of fortune In 199296 counties with fewer than 100000 people produced 32 percent of new enterprises while the biggest counties produced 13 percentBy 201014 very rural counties saw zero net growth in new firms while the biggest counties boomed with 58 percent of new firms All counties with populations under a million created 87 percent of the nations new businesses from 19921996 but the number was 42 percent in 201014In other words the centurieslong shift of economic activity from country and small wn areas  populous urban regions has sharply accelerated over the past 10 years The result is that America faces a smallcounty crisis of dire proportions as Mark Muro a senior fellow at Brookings put it and a period of opportunity in cities the bigger the betterThere is a combination of forces driving these trends according  Muro most especially the growing importance of the high tech and digital industries Urbanization he wrote mehas become a major trend in the last decade or so driven  the clustering of workers and firms in larger cities The increased digitization of the economy has accelerated this dynamic and ensured that changing skills demands have changed what places are best valuedAt the same time Muro noted  emailRural America has been hammered  the end of the immediate postcrisis commodity boom and now there is precious little relief there Agricultural prices are low coal prices and aumation are hammering coal country natural gas prices are suffering from glut conditions and meanwhile no subdivision of the economy is suffering from more moribund employment growthThe rural crisis according  Muro isnt just economic but is now compounded  the rising mortality rates described in detail  the economists Anne Case and Angus Deana more complete picture of midlife mortality   sex and education

despair rates for whites without college degrees compared  the virtually unchanging rates for whites with degreesCase and Dean found that mortality rates for whites were stable or declining in all counties with populations of one million or more  the counties in other words that voted decisively for Clinn Conversely white mortality rates rose  roughly one percent a year in all counties of less

ranging from family values  education  child rearing practices  religious faithMuch attention has been paid  one daunting task facing Republicans the need  prevent liberal values and ideas from seeping beyond large urban counties in red counties and statesAs the last election demonstrated the compact geographical distribution of Democratic voters with liberal or progressive ideologies in states that were already blue allowed Trump  win in the Elecral College despite a sizable Democratic vicry in the popular voteDemocrats in turn must figure out a way  extend their reach beyond the megapopulation centers located mostly on the coasts where cosmopolitan globalist and postmaterialist values dominateTrump supporters politics may be filtered through the perverse lenses of racial

The political success or failure of the Trump administration will be determined in large part  the answer  a simple question Is Trumps ability  give voice  the anger and resentment of his constituents adequate  offset his broken promises and what his enemies trumpet as his failure  improve the lives of those who voted for himI could not possibly be more thrilled than  be 100 miles away from Washingns swamp spending my evening with all of you and with a much much larger crowd and much better peopleHis goal of course was not only  ally himself with the crowd against the blacktiewearing media celebrating at the Washingn Hiln but  goad and troll his opponentsMany liberal Democrats think that Trumps taunting rheric will soon wear thin According  this view as decent jobs increasingly demand college degrees as aumation continues  decimate manufacturing employment and as voters lose key benefits of the liberal welfare state pared down health coverage under a new Republican program for example support for Trump will fade awayMurphy may be proven prescient But there are a number of ways for Trump  maintain support among his voters without delivering the tangible economic or social benefits he promisedFirst of all the bulk of Trumps supporters have nowhere else  go nor do they want  go anywhere They experience themselves as living in a different world from liberals and DemocratsTheir animosity ward the left and the lefts animosity ward them is entrenchedPresident Trump reminds distrustful citizens of liberal institutions disinterest in and disrespect for challenges in their own lives Arthur Lupia a political scientist at the University of Michigan wrote in response  my inquiry about Trumps appealInstead of the type of conflict largely based off of tribal affiliations Abramowitz and Webster find thatThe rise of negative affect and incivility in American politics is closely connected with the rise of ideological polarization among the public as well as among political elites Democrats and Republicans dislike each other day because they disagree with each other about many issues and especially about the fundamental question of the role of government in American society It is very hard  disagree without being disagreeable when there are so many issues on which we disagree and the disagreements on many of these issues are so deepMore succinctly they writeRational dislike of the other party may be more difficult  overcome than irrational dislikeWhen the candidates are relatively divergent there is virtually no chance that partisans will cross party lines and vote for the candidate of the opposite partyThe near certainty that partisans will not switch  the opposition gives Trump an unexpected level of freedom in his policy choices As Rogowski put itHigh levels of ideological conflict lead partisan voters  make decisions that place increased emphasis on their partisan ties and less emphasis on the relative degree of congruence between their policy views and the candidates platformsIn an email Rogowski elaboratedMost Americans are sorted in one of the two majorparty camps and their party membership is an important part of their identities For Americans who identify as Republicans voting for a Democratic candidate would be inconsistent with their identity  and the same goes for Democraticidentifiers considering a vote for a Republican candidateIn this environment Rogowski continuedTrump can more or less count on continued support from Republican identifiers and has some freedom of choice on policy issuesIn other words Trump can go either left or right as he betrays his campaign promises  as long as his followers believe that he is standing with them and is against what theyre againstThere are also more subtle changes working  Trumps advantageJust as partisan ideological divisions and animosities are starker and starker so o are divisions in the ways that men and women conduct their daily lives in red and blue regions of the United StatesIn Spatial Aspects of the American Culture War The Two Dimensions of US Family Demography and the Presidential Elections 19682016 the authors writeThe map of the American Culture War is not only in evidence in the local voting patterns but just as markedly so in its family demographyVoting for Democratic presidential candidates Lesthaeghe and Neidert found correlates with a number of key demographic variables an increase in the percentage of white nonHispanic women between the ages of 25  34 who have never married abortions per 1000 live births older mothers age at first birth of 28 or over and the percentage of households with same or different sex cohabitantsLesthaeghe writesThe SDT starts in the 1960s with a series of multifaceted revolutions First there was the contraceptive revolution with the introduction of hormonal contraception and far more efficient IUDs second there was the sexual revolution with declining ages at first sexual intercourse and third there was the sex revolution questioning the sole breadwinner household model and the gendered division of labor that accompanied it These three revolutions fit within the framework of an overall rejection of authority the assertion of individual freedom of choice aunomy and an overhaul of the normative structure The overall outcome of these shifts with respect  fertility was the postponement of childbearing mean ages at first parenthood rise again opportunities for childbearing are lost due  higher divorce rates the share of childless everpartnered women increases and higher parity births four or more become rareThe demographic constituency described  Lesthaeghe is the liberal urban cosmopolitan welleducated elite embodied in many respects not only  Hillary Clinn but  much of official Washingn  the attendees at the White House Correspondents Association dinner so conspicuously shunned  TrumpAt the end of their recent essay Lesthaeghe and Neidert askCan we conclude that an era of conservative backlash has been inaugurated  the election of TrumpTheir answer is that its o early  tell They note that while issues change with each electionthe relative positions of states have been very stable since the mid1990s and very predictable on the basis of the SDT pattern at the onset Very much the same holds for counties Evidently the map of the American Culture War is not only in evidence in the local voting patterns but just as markedly so in its family demographyThe second chart shows the actual line up of states in 2016 from reddest Utah

demographic transition Trumps fervid rally audiences the White House Correspondents Association dinner and political identityOver the past 50 years overarching and underlying conflicts about morality family aunomy religious conviction fairness and even patriotism have been forced in two relatively weak vessels the Democratic Party and the Republican Party The political system is not equipped

questions that cut  the core of how we see ourselves and the people around us  cannot be contained in ordinary political speech even as these issues dominate our political decisionmakingIt is Trumps willingness  violate the boundaries of conventional discourse that has granted him immunity  mainstream criticism Pretty much everything he does that goes overboard helps him He is given a free hand

their partys leadersWhile white voters with a high school degree or less have steadily declined as a share of the elecrate  from 82 percent of adults 25 and older in 1940  29 percent in 2007  they have repeatedly played a crucial role in determining the outcome of electionsThese two elections marked the establishment of a conservative majority that produced Republican presidential vicries in 1980 1984 and 1988  the only exception being 1976 when Watergate briefly stalled the ascendance of the rightThe challenges facing the white working class are indeed severe According  Teixeira and AbramowitzBetween 1979 and 2005 the average real hourly wage for those with a college degree went up 22 percent and for those with advanced degrees 28 percent In contrast average wages for those with only some college went up a mere 3 percent actually fell 2 percent for those with a high school diploma and for high school dropouts declined a stunning 18 percentThe accompanying chart based on an analysis  the Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies illustrates aggregated exit poll data from the Republican primaries held through March 21 It shows the demographic groups that have provided Trump with relatively high and relatively low levels of supportThe comparatively low levels of support for Trump among collegeeducated Republicans women young voters and those with incomes above 100000 suggest that these voters are most likely  sit out the election or  vote Democratic if Trump is the nominee Conversely groups that gave him higher than average support in the primaries  the less well educated those with incomes below the median men and rural voters  are likely  deliver his best margins in the general electionIf there are two key themes in the election so far one is Trumps ability  enrage the other is his ability  exceed expectations The disregard of liberal and conservative elites for working and middle class voters has manifested itself in a consistent underestimation of the anger resentment and pessimism of these voters  and hence of their elecral powerThe primaries have demonstrated the importance of the primary process in making unheard voices

The enduring  and grossly inaccurate  stereotypes about Vietnam veteransBy 1967 protesters were gathering regularly in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House Theyd hold signs give speeches and chant Hey hey LBJ How many babies did you kill dayThe veteran said yesServes you right the man saidLong after the war ended the idea of the Vietnam veteran as an amoral drugaddled even psychopathic ba killer pervaded American culture cropping up in films like Taxi Driver First Blood and Jacobs Ladder But those stereotypes are flawed A vast majority of Americans who served never committed atrocities they fought bravely against a determined enemy in harsh conditions and they reintegrated in society and made substantial contributions over the yearsThis was especially true of those who were fighting in 1967 when the troop level reached more than 480000 Whether recent recruit or veteran most of those troops went  Vietnam that year as individuals sent  replace those finishing their oneyear urs 13 months for the Marines But while each had his own sry there was a common experience one that belied many of the stereotypesFor one thing like their fathers in World War II many had volunteered Countless shared the view of an Arizona veteran I interviewed  They didnt have  draft us It was a part of what we were supposed  do As he saw it It was part of my duty as a manOthers found themselves ensnared  the draft As one veteran noted The Selective Service sword of Damocles had been hanging over our head since we all turned 18 Still a large majority of those drafted in 1967 answered their countrys call Only 7234 of the 298559 men who were drafted failed  report for duty that year I guess I just accepted it and figured Hey lets go give it a shot  make the best of it  one veteran ld meWherever the men were coming from they either boarded crowded troop ships many from World War II or left on planes in the latter case in less than 24 hours they went from home  a war zone One soldier said that upon arriving in Vietnam he felt like Alice stepping through the looking glass The heavy odor of jet fuel and feeling like being in a very smelly sauna ok his breath away As he stepped off the plane a stewardess mouthed good luck I knew my life would never be the same from this moment on he recalled This was the initiation in my rites of passageThe experiences of service members in Vietnam often differed depending on location type of service and above all timing Some rarely left the relatively safe confines of the major bases working as clerks accountants and mechanics Others were thrown in combat an asunding 997 men were killed on their first day in VietnamHisrians veterans and journalists recall 1967 in Vietnam a year that changed the war and changed AmericaWhile 23 million men and women served in the Vietnam theater the hard fighting fell on a relatively small percentage of those men primarily the infantry and close support like artillerymen tank crews and pilots And its true that many of those men experienced psychological and emotional difficulties A veteran admitted crying for the suffering the pain and for the fear that invades you because you dont know when youre going  die But few of them broke most conquered the fear and often the boredom of searching for an elusive guerrilla enemy in the South or fighting pitched battles in the northern war zones against hardened North Vietnamese Army regularsWhere men did sometimes break and where they were most liable  commit war crimes was in the South Being unable  identify the enemy created overwhelming stress A barber or laundress on base or a peasant working in the fields during the day might lay boo traps at night This led  atrocities Rogue members of the antiguerrilla Tiger Force killed hundreds of civilians in March 1968 American soldiers killed hundreds more at the South Vietnamese village of My LaiBut war crimes were very far from common Indeed for each atrocity there were many more acts of kindness ward civilians and bravery in combat Soldiers rebuilt schools homes and roads often on their own initiative 244 Americans received the Medal of Honor more than in World War I and Korea combinedPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersMost men wherever they were just wanted  go home Few had any illusions about how the war would shape the rest of their lives but they also pined for their old normal existence and a return  their families and homewns Few veterans can forget the day they left Vietnam most walking up the steps of a Freedom Bird airliner for the trip home One recalled Boy everybody sod up and cheered when the pilot announced we were crossing in the United StatesBut those returning received few parades or recognition and often felt isolated from their countrymen One remembered his sister asking Who are you fighting for the North Vietnamese or the other guys He lamented I knew that nobody back here undersod what was happening Because if my own family didnt know what hope did I have with somebody who even know meThe disconnection and boredom of life stateside led some  return  Vietnam for another ur Nonetheless the majority persevered back home As one said Most of the veterans returned home reasonably whole as whole as returning veterans from earlier wars The majority were not dopers did not beat their wives or children did not commit suicide did not haunt the unemployment offices and did not boozily sink in despair and futilityThey hid their emotional scars just as their fathers had after World War II though they bore the added injury of an angry often disrespectful America They were forced  carry the weight of political and military decisions  answer for Johnson and William Westmoreland whether they agreed with them or not This in a way is where the stereotype of the fragile veteran finds some truth  not in the war itself but in the reception back home As the writer Tim OBrien noted Some vets more than a decade later have not yet recovered and some never willStill polls show that a vast majority of Vietnam veterans are proud of their service and sacrificeThis isnt  say that Vietnam veterans were no different from those of other wars the unique experiences of that war created unique challenges at home Thousands suffered the longterm effects of Agent Orange thousands more especially those who served later in the war came home with drug and alcohol problems or later developed them as coping mechanismsBut lost in that stereotype is the strength of the response from the veteran community Veteran activists revolutionized the Veterans Administration health system demanding  and winning  better care Others like Bob Kerrey Max Cleland Chuck Hagel and John McCain moved in politics where they worked on behalf of fellow veterans And they built the Wall  the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Founded  veterans and funded through private donations the wall gave veterans a place  heal not just themselves but their often frayed bonds with their fellow AmericansOf the 298559 men who entered service in 1967 11363 did not return from Vietnam Most veterans understand the feelings of an anonymous author who said War drew us from our homeland in the sunlit springtime of our

Over the years there have been few more vocal or aggressive advocates for law enforcement than Rudolph W Giuliani A former p official at the Justice Department a onetime prosecur with a ugh crusading style and a policeembracing mayor who ran New York on a lawandorder platform Mr Giuliani  both in office and as a private citizen  has spent the better part of his career stridently defending the countrys crimefighting class and fiercely lashing out at those who attack itBut in his latest role as a lawyer for President Trump Mr Giuliani who like his client is volatile  nature appears  have made an abrupt change of course In the past few days he has launched a series of rants in the media assailing his former colleagues in law enforcement  and the work that they have done  as Nazis frauds and garbage And in a phone interview Friday he defended the strong criticism he had madeWhile the path from prosecur  defense lawyer is a common one that often requires a sharp shift in perspective several former lawenforcement officials said they found it curious that Mr Giuliani had so quickly and belligerently turned his back on a world he had worked in for nearly 30 years Even some who expressed support for him said that his assaults on everyone and everything from the Russia investigation  James B Comey the former direcr of the FBI  the bureaus New York office seemed  be out of characterIts asnishing especially from someone who has been so supportive of law enforcement for as long as he has said Asha Rangappa a former FBI agent who now works as a TV analyst and a senior lecturer at Yale University I cant believe that anyone believes that he really believes what hes been saying But its a standard defense counsel playbook When you dont have the facts on your side you attack the investigarsOn Thursday morning after Mr Comey shot back on his Twitter account saying that the New York FBI was devoted  the rule of law and the truth Mr Giuliani assailed Mr Comey his onetime colleague in the United States atrneys office in Manhattan as a sensitive little ba By Thursday afternoon he had ssed another bomb calling for Atrney General Jeff Sessions  step in on the Cohen case and put the people behind it under investigationIn all of this Mr Giuliani was following the lead of Mr Trump who in both the Cohen and Russia matters has adopted a strategy of attacking agents prosecurs and the larger institutions of the Justice Department and the FBI While some former lawenforcement officials said that those attacks had eroded trust in the criminaljustice establishment others said that the figures singled out  the president and his lawyer were deserving of their ireRudy is not antilaw enforcement but he is upset like me at a small cadre of people who have lost their way said James K Kallstrom who once ran the New York office of the FBI and has emerged more recently as a vigorous supporter of Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani Weve had long talks about it and what we can do  rebuild the bureauIn an interview on Friday evening Mr Giuliani echoed those concerns adding that while he maintained respect for Mr Mueller some of the prosecurs on the special counsels team had ethical problems He also said that his recent criticisms were not at odds with his lawenforcement pastIts all consistent with law and order because some of these people arent acting appropriately Mr Giuliani said Ive never been in favor of oufcontrol law and order Im not going after the whole FBI Im going after the people on this caseStill it is not the normal course for a former p criminaljustice official  savage the institutions that gave birth  him But the inquiries in Mr Trump and his associates are so riven  questions of legal ethics and partisan politics that they seemed  have polarized and stirred up passions in lawenforcement circlesTrying  take the middle course Nancy Savage the executive direcr of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI said that Mr Giuliani has a long hisry of supporting the FBI and of supporting law enforcement But Ms Savage also noted There are numerous serious investigations that are ongoing and they need  be respected moving forwardTom OConnor the president of a similar group the FBI Agents Association said of Mr Giuliani It is disappointing when former officials who have hisrically supported FBI special agents and the investigative process now demean agents for performing our jobsA former United States atrney in Manhattan John S Martin Jr had an even blunter view of Mr Giuliani saying that he had more or less betrayed his erstwhile colleaguesCollapse,politics
OpinionMr McConnell was referring  his partys grudging acceptance without resort  filibusters of President Obamas firstterm nominees  the court Sonia Somayor and Elena Kagan What Mr McConnell notably neglected  mention of course was the very different approach he himself had taken with the open seat Mr Trump was now on the verge of filling refusing even  hold a confirmation hearing last year for Mr Obamas nominee Judge Merrick B GarlandThat Mr McConnell could now blithely ask for a routine reception of a Trump nominee for the very seat that he managed  freeze unfilled for nearly a year galls Democrats  no end and demonstrates more than ever that its impossible  match Mr McConnell for sheer chutzpah But his comment also underscored the conundrum that the Democrats and their new leader Chuck Schumer of New York now confront in the Senate minorityAs Mr McConnell showed in the first six years of President Obamas tenure the Senates rules and traditions allow a determined minority  block much of a presidents agenda  indeed the Democrats 48 Senate seats are their only real leverage against President Trump But Mr McConnells unprecedented use of the filibuster  which forced Democrats  muster 60 votes  get anything done  and other obstructionist tactics drew loud rebukes from Democrats and traditionalists who identified his intransigence as eroding longstanding norms and contributing greatly  voters anger over a dysfunctional WashingnCan Democrats who are more philosophically invested in showing that government can function really bring themselves  replicate Mr McConnells obstructionist methods Would they really be willing  withhold cooperation even in areas where they and President Trump might find agreement such as a major infrastructure packageThese questions are especially pressing for Senate Democrats because of the landscape they face next year when 25 of their seats including those of the two independents who caucus with them are up for reelection as opposed  only eight Republican ones Those 25 include five in states that Mr Trump won handily West Virginia Missouri Indiana Montana and North Dakota Doesnt unified opposition  the president mean risking those seats and further diminishing their minority statusA closer look at Mr McConnells opposition during the Obama years suggests that the choices confronting Mr Schumer and the Democrats may not be as stark as they seem For one thing the McConnell approach does not preclude going through the motions of working with the president of the opposite party Recall that in the summer of 2009 Mr McConnell allowed three Republicans led  Chuck Grassley of Iowa  spend months meeting with three Democratic counterparts on health care reform The negotiations came  naught allowing Mr McConnell  claim that his partys eventual monolithic vote against the Affordable Care Act came only after the Democrats refusal  move off their far left proposalThe meetings also dragged out debate around the bill helping sour the public on the legislation As Robert F Bennett then a Utah senar and close McConnell ally who died last year ld me of Mr McConnell in early 2014 He said Our strategy is  delay this sucker as long as we possibly can and the longer we delay it the worse the president looks Why cant he get it done  He remembered the party leaders promise  delay it delay it delay it as long as we can The main lesson Every time something would come up he would find a way  delay it Another lesson for Mr Schumer and the Democrats might be that they could enter in negotiations over an infrastructure package but insist on doing it mostly on their termsThe record of Republican intransigence in the Obama years also suggests that voters pay far less attention  the legislative process than Washingn insiders would like  believe What Mr McConnell recognized was that a presidents party is rewarded in midterm elections if hes popular and getting things done and punished if hes not Mr Grassley for instance mightve been tempted  help President Obama create a bipartisan health care bill since he hailed from a state Iowa that had embraced Mr Obama in 2008 Instead  withholding support and even endorsing the death panel rheric around the bill Mr Grassley fueled the resistance  the overreaching president in 2010 and easily won reelection that yearSimilarly Senate Democrats 2018 prospects in states that Mr Trump won will depend more on whether hes seen as succeeding  on how energized or demoralized the ends of the polarized elecrate are  than on whether a given senar found an issue or two of common ground with himAll of this still leaves the basic question of whether Democrats really have it in them  slow government  a crawl as much as Mr McConnell did Their willingness goaded on  an inflamed Democratic base  force postponements of committee votes on Trump nominees suggests they just might The biggest test still awaits whether in protest of the treatment of Judge Garland  filibuster the confirmation of Mr Trumps Supreme Court nominee Neil M rsuch which could lead  Republicans eliminating the filibuster for court confirmations once and for allBut Mr Ornstein ld me that he is changing his thinking on this after witnessing initial Trump moves such as the ban on travel from seven majorityMuslim countries and witnessing how reluctant Republicans have been  provide a check on him He now recommends that Democrats stall President Trumps agenda  repeatedly denying unanimous consent on the Senate floorThis sounds similar  Mr McConnells brand of obstruction but Mr Ornstein argues its not because the opponent is different We dont have a conventional president he said Were seeing behavior that could lead us right down the path  martial law or authoritarian rule These are dangerous times and you have  think through your strategy in that context For Democrats using leverage  pull us back from the brink of something that shatters our fundamental system is now in orderOf course Mr McConnell had framed the context for his own obstructionism in dire terms o saying it was necessary  withhold bipartisan cooperation from Mr Obama so that voters would realize just how radical his agenda really was Now with Mr Trump in the White House and Republicans in control of Congress Mr McConnell is calling for a new era of cooperation The first thing we have  do is move beyond this usandthem mentality that has so often characterized the last eight years he said on the Senate floor late last month Were all in this gether We rise and fall as oneAlec MacGillis is a

OpEd ContribursEmily Bazelon a staff writer for The New York Times Magazine and the Truman Capote Fellow at Yale Law School and Elizabeth itein the codirecr of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan center watched James B Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee day where the former FBI direcr discussed the investigation in Russian interference in the presidential electionMoving forward if this hearing is any indication Trumps defenders will be trying  portray Trumps pressuring Comey  drop the Flynn investigation as an isolated incident a president who simply didnt know any better going a bit o far trying  get a friend off the hook It will be up  lawmakers journalists and others  keep the focus on the bigger picture and keep pushing for answers on the nature of Trump associates ties  RussiaBut lets take a real step back  the very beginning Last summer and fall a hostile foreign power used hackers  try  get a candidate Donald Trump elected The FBI determined there was sufficient evidence that Trumps campaign colluded with Russia in this effort  open an investigation which continues  this day The president asked Comey then the FBI direcr  pledge his loyalty and  shut down one part of the investigation When the direcr didnt comply he was fired And the intelligence committee hearing on all of this proceeded like it was just another partisan fight about tax cuts The word surreal comes  mindThe full conversation that they had during the hearing is belowOf course the key questions going in day were all about influence and pressure and how much of each the president can legitimately exert over the FBI direcr who was investigating his campaign and key players in his administrationLiza what did we learn from the released statement yesterday that mattered most I saw Trumps defenders and critics both doubling down Is that because we are in a grey area in which we see the president tromping all over norms of FBI and Justice Department independence without necessarily seeing clear indictable proof of the crime of obstruction of justice Or is that the wrong standard since what matters is the political bar for obstruction which means its up  Congress It seems as if these shouldnt be partisan questions Yet they areTheres no serious argument that this is appropriate behavior from an American president Imagine for a moment testimony that President Barack Obama or a hypothetical President Hillary Clinn had a similar conversation with an FBI direcr The entire conservativemedia world would erupt in outrage and rightly so The FBI direcr is a lawenforcement officer loyal  the Constitution not the presidents consigliereComey said he had no regrets about his decision last July and Ocber  publicly discuss the FBIs investigation in Hillary Clinns private email server What he did broke with Justice Department practice Democrats have intensely criticized him for itI dont really think Trump was drawing conclusions in the way that Lowry implies It seems more likely that the president was just trying  get what he wanted But is there something  the underlying idea that Comey himself scrambled the rules for what should and shouldnt be public in the context of a highly politicized FBI investigationAnd  the way how telling is it that the former direcr of the FBI testified that he felt he needed  document every encounter with Trump because given the nature of the person he felt Trump might lie He actually used the L word Its a relief  hear after listening  all the rtured synonyms reporters come up with  try  avoid calling it what it is Its not just a personal foible and acknowledging it isnt an ad hominem attack When the president lies it undermines the workings of democracyTrump is right about the cloud hanging over him Comey set a bad precedent last summer and I hope the FBI ditches it Though with Washingn leaking like a sieve its very hard  imagine how the agency could start investigating Trump personally and keep it a secret But really its for Congress  in particular the Senate Intelligence Committee  give a public accountingBut moving on weve repeatedly heard suggestions day that if Trump was only trying  get the FBI  back off from one person Flynn thats not a big problem But of course it is For one thing we have no idea how central Flynn might be  the larger Russia investigation as I mentioned before Even more important this goes  the heart of one of the most dangerous attributes of this president His lack of respect for the rule of lawCollapse,politics
Common SenseFew if any literary philosophers have had as much influence on American business and politics as Ayn Rand especially now that Donald J Trump occupies the White HousePresident Trump named Rand his favorite writer and The Fountainhead his favorite novel Secretary of State Rex W Tillerson has cited Atlas Shrugged as a favorite work and the CIA direcr Mike Pompeo said the book really had an impact on meAs Ray Dalio the founder of Bridgewater Associates the worlds largest hedge fund put it in a recent essay her books pretty well capture the mindset of the Trump administration This new administration hates weak unproductive socialist people and policies he wrote and it admires strong cando profit makersIn business Rands influence has been especially pronounced in Silicon Valley where her overarching philosophy that man exists for his own sake that the pursuit of his own happiness is his highest moral purpose that he must not sacrifice himself  others nor sacrifice others  himself as she described it in a 1964 Playboy interview has an obvious appeal for selfmade entrepreneurs Last year Vanity Fair anointed her the most influential figure in the technology industry surpassing Steve JobsAnd then theres the scandalengulfed Trump administration where devotion  Rands teaching has done little  advance the presidents legislative agendaThough people close  Mr Kalanick ld me this week that he has distanced himself from many of Rands precepts while undergoing an intense period of personal reassessment they all acknowledged that shed had a profound influence on his development Few companies have been as closely identified with Rands philosophy as UberUber disrupted a complacent highly regulated and often corrupt taxi industry on a global scale an achievement Rands heroes Howard Roark and Dagny Taggart would surely have admired Many of her ideas were embedded in Ubers code of values Mr Kalanick used the original cover art for The Fountainhead as his Twitter avatar until 2013 when he exchanged it for an image of Alexander Hamiln and then in May for one of himselfRands entrepreneur is the Promethean hero of capitalism said Lawrence E Cahoone professor of philosophy at the College of the Holy Cross whose lecture on Rand is part of his Great Courses series The Modern Political Tradition But she never really explores how a dynamic entrepreneur actually runs a businessShe was a script and fiction writer he continued She was motivated  an intense hatred of communism and she put those things gether very effectively She can be very inspirational especially  entrepreneurs But she was  no means an economist I dont think her work can be used as a business manualRepresentatives of Uber and Mr Kalanick declined  commentRands defenders insist that the problems for Mr Kalanick and others influenced  Rand arent that they embraced her philosophy but rather that they didnt go far enoughYaron Brook executive chairman of the Ayn Rand Institute and a former finance professor at Santa Clara University who teaches seminars on business leadership and ethics from an Objectivist perspective said Few business people have actually read her essays and philosophy and studied her in depth Mr Brook said that while Mr Kalanick was obviously talented and energetic and a visionary he ok superficial inspiration from her ideas and used her philosophy  justify his obnoxiousnessHe emphasized that Rand would never have lerated sexual harassment or any kind of mistreatment of employees Rand had enormous respect for people who worked hard and did a good job whether a secretary or a railroad worker he said Her heroes ran businesses with employees who were very loyal because they were treated fairly Of course some people had  be fired But she makes a big deal out of the virtue of justice which applies in business as well as politicsAnd even though shed celebrate what Travis did with the taxi industry showing the world how all those regulations made no sense she also believed there are rules of justice that do make sense and she supported he said You cant just run over all the regulations you dont happen  likeMr Brook complained that Rands critics are quick  point  her followers failures but rarely mention their successes He cited the example of John A Allison IV the muchadmired former head of BBT Corporation a regional bank in the Southeast that he built in one of the nations largest before he stepped down in 2008 Mr Allison handed out copies of Atlas Shrugged  senior executives and is a major donor  the Ayn Rand Institute He incorporated many of Rands teachings in his 2014 book The Leadership Crisis and the Free Market CureJohn is a gentleman and he actually studied Rands works in depth Mr Brook said He couldnt be more different from TravisMr Allison has called for abolishing the Federal Reserve while acknowledging that so drastic a step is unlikely He has met with Mr Trump at the White House and has been widely mentioned as a potential successor  Janet L Yellen as Fed chiefDespite Rands pervasive influence and continuing popularity on college campuses relatively few people embrace her version of extreme libertarianism Former President Barack Obama in a 2012 Rolling Sne interview criticized her narrow vision and described her work as one of those things that a lot of us when we were 17 or 18 and feeling misundersod wed pick upShes also dismissed  most serious academics Mention Ayn Rand  a group of academic philosophers and youll get laughed out of the room Mr Cahoone said But I think theres something  be said for Rand She takes Nietzschean individualism  an extreme but shes undeniably inspirationalAs the mysterious character John Galt proclaims near the end of Atlas Shrugged Do not let your fire go out spark  irreplaceable spark in the hopeless swamps of the approximate the notquite the notyet the notatall Do not let the hero in your soul perish in lonely frustration for the life you deserved but have never been able  reach Check your road and the nature of your battle The world you desired can be won it exists it is real it is possible its yoursBut Rand has little  say about making the transition from this kind of heroic entrepreneurial vision  a mature corporation with many stakeholders a problem many company founders have confronted and struggled with whether or not theyve read or been influenced  her She never really had  manage anything Mr Cahoone said She was surrounded  people who saw her as a cult figure She didnt have employees she had worshipersFor his part Mr Kalanick is said  have turned this summer from Rand  what is considered one of the greatest dramatic works in the English language Shakespeares Henry V  a play in which the young reckless and wayward Prince Hal matures in one of Englands most revered and beloved monarchsCollapse,politics
At 47 JayZ thinks about where hes been where hes going and what hes leaving behind Its all there on his latest album 444Supported Old school still has some currency in hiphop It nods  forebears styles and hisry Old is a different sry Old means youre past your prime It means you have nothing new  say  and even if you did who would want  listen Old means maybe you know whats new but you want  do it the way youve always done it So old also means fixed settled stuckBy those standards JayZ at 47 might seem old Standards are presumptuous though because really what do we know about old rappers Only that they dont rap as much as they used  I mean theyre still around  but as part of backpatting nostalgia in concert or on HBO or hosting the Grammys or cooking with Martha Stewart Maybe theyve still got it But vital new music is secondary at bestBut its better than good a gorgeously produced stab at selfexamination it runs less than the length of a standard therapy session that suggests a new direction for raps elder statesmen It also demonstrates a way that certain black artists can reckon with middle age   accepting the emotionalism humor and selfcriticism that come naturally  a current generation of younger rappersIts entirely possible that JayZ arrived  record Magna Carta aware that theres not much of a road map for a rapper in his 40s especially one whose body of work and reputation are great enough  haunt him His clever brash kaleidoscopically grim 1996 debut Reasonable Doubt is as much a work of memoir of life in the streetlevel drug trade as it is an albumOn it he raps with the impunity of a mafia don Its a distinction thats always kept him seeming a little older than everybody else while eventually holding his competirs youth against them On songs like Change Clothes with Pharrell from 2003 and Off That with a youngandhungry Drake from 2009 he was all o happy  display a cranky oldsoul impatience arguing that because he thinks he is grown up his peers should oYall epithet acting way o ughThrow on a suit and get it tapered up he implored on Change ClothesBut eventually that sense of superiority came  sound like an exercise Rap is a language art and no matter your age you need something  say The problem with Magna Carta wasnt that JayZ was o old It is that he sounded bored The music was disconnected from life and his materialism sounded pass even for hiphop Fashion art love even philanthropy were spiked with a testy selfconsciousness The whole thing reeked of midlife crisisThen Beyonc released Lemonade and more or less ld him It arrived in the spring of 2016 and announced  the world that his sense of risk  as a former drug dealer an entrepreneur and a womanizer  has a cost her loveIts believable that JayZ really had run out of fresh ideas But if he were going  keep making new records Lemonade demanded at least a partial response  Beyoncs agony and the scope of her artistryThe resulting album isnt trying  match either Lemonade is a fully processed entirely emotional performance 444 is Tony Soprano at his first couple of sessions with Dr Melfi Hes not tally sure why hes here and is occasionally petty about it JayZ acknowledges the pain he caused without entirely agreeing  own itIts the production  the longtime hiphop and RB producer No I D that most gives the album its psychology He puts samples  the Alan Parsons Project Stevie Wonder Nina Simone the Clark Sisters and Hannah Williams  the Affirmations  masterly use Where JayZ is inclined  be passive the music insinuates It makes him seem more culpable vulnerable spiritual and transparent than he might even realize No I D is a studio wizard Hes also Dr MelfiJayZs old creative and sexual promiscuity have been replaced  an act of commitment No more women just his wife No more gluts of great producers just this one These are the new risks for him monogamy focus trust There are new existential concerns o The ambition here extends from his own plight  the straits of black people all over America Nothing like a coherent thesis emerges but hes feeling his way ward if not a moral capitalism then the idea of who capitalism is forJayZ began his career talking about all the money he had and how he made it Now hes aged in a man with time  think about what the money means what else it can do He has become wealthy and wealth is money with dimension vision and heirsEvery time Im reading a magazine and see one of those ads for a Patek Philippe watch I take a second  wonder about the meaning of wealth This is a timepiece you take out a mortgage for The ads usually feature two or three generations of handsome white people and the tag line is something obnoxiously poignant like You never actually own a Patek Philippe You merely look after it for the next generationIts a mission statement about legacy and affluence thats rarely mentioned in rap which is sometimes pathologically obsessed with the optics of spending Saving never comes up Neither does nonmusical posterity To be fair whats sexy about thosePromiscuity is a rap subject Paternity not so much Young men understandably arent o concerned with the future New money tends  burn holes in pockets Putting something away having something  hand down those tend  be oldperson concerns Certainly other rappers have wills But JayZ is actually ruminating about his Hes wondering o whether your moneys doing all it canOn 444 he gets churlish about that In The Sry of O J he asks and answers You know whats more important than spending money in a strip club CreditA line later he is asking regrettably if we know why the Jews own all the property in America His phrasing perpetuates one stereotype  emphasize another about black people and capital  that compared with white people they have none His pointing this out at 47 requires you  know what he was like when he was 27 when the gentleman at the club was himSome of the risk of being an old rapper is that the old posturing wont do You actually have  stand for something JayZ also has  reckon with where he has sod  with the Obamas on one hand but also cavalierly against womankind on the other What does he make of his track record his hisry say with women and what will his children make of thatMaybe this is why young rappers dont rap old The evolving nature of maturity can make you seem like a hypocriteThis idea of legacy becomes a halting socioeconomic lecture on 444 Hes working hard for his estate so that death wont leave a hole It will leave a whole This is an ultrapractical view of the end of life that testifies  the sort of bootstrap conservatism that argues that because one black person has overcome the systemic and selfinflicted roadblocks  success anyone can These are his ragsriches racial politics Hes made his black life matter so should youAs popular culture archetypes these used  be scary black men But every once in a while theyre granted a humanity that with oldschool rappers is harder  come  Its not an art form that forgives weakness concession or blame It runs on burnishing and destroying egos It thrives on the performance of flawless maximal authenticity and lyrical supremacy JayZ doesnt relinquish his ego on 444 But on Kill JayZ the rueful opening song he contemplates the downsides of having such a strong one Die JayZ this aint back in the daysYou dont need an alibi JayZCry JayZ we know the pain is realBut you cant heal what you never revealThis is JayZ driving half the night  some place weve never seen him go perhaps  some place hes never even been But part of maturity  whether or not youre a rapper  is being human enough  accept that the first step is getting in the carCollapse,politics

incapable of addressing any of these things they frittered away their hours in disputes over tariffs and trade and when election time came they lined up in their respective parties each one hoping for the chance  distribute the federal spoils  itself Presidential elections were achingly close In 1888 Grover Cleveland won the popular vote but lost  Benjamin Harrison in the Elecral College fueling a sense that the political process no longer worked properlySome Americans demanded elecral reform we can thank them with mixed feelings for inventing the presidential primary Others turned  populism a Western and Southern revolt against the East Coast elite Still others embraced the idea that some independent objective authority standing outside partisan politics might swoop in Washingn and set things rightToday many Americans are attaching similar hopes  the newly appointed special counsel Robert Mueller hailed as just the sort of independent figure  deliver the truth about Russias intervention in the 2016 election I believe Mueller will be independent he will be thorough and he will be fair said Representative Elijah Cummings the highestranking Democrat on the House Oversight Committee Speaker of the House Paul Ryan professed a similar need  ensure thorough and independent investigations are allowed  follow the facts wherever they may leadGiven the parade of scandals and lies emanating from the Trump White House the prospect of finding one independent soul among our thousands of partisan warriors holds an obvious political appeal But what does it mean  be truly independent in the hyperpartisan 21st century when nearly everything in American life seems  end up as a mark on the political scorecard  pro or con win or loss Republican or Democrat Is it still possible  survive as an independent operar within the atmosphere of personal vendetta and political retribution that is Trumps Washingn Or will the Russia investigation turn out  be a showdown not only between the president and his critics but also between partisanship and the very idea of political independenceThis ideal of the selfless federal servant was always partly a noble fiction as Hamiln fans know the founding eras hostilities were vicious enough that a vice president killed a former Treasury secretary The aspiration  meet that ideal nonetheless held sway well in the 1820s creating what became known as the Era of od Feelings It was as debates over slavery and terririal expansion heated up that party warfare returned The Civil War itself erupted in the aftermath of a partisan event the election of the countrys first Republican presidentTwo decades later the assassination of President James Garfield brought a new round of national soulsearching The deranged assassin Charles Guiteau said he committed the deed in order  unify the Republican Party and because he felt he had deserved a patronage appointment as a European ambassador A couple years later in 1883 Congress passed the Pendlen Act the nations first comprehensive Civil Service law designed partly  calm the roiling political waters Under these new rules many federal jobs would be parceled out according  merit rather than party patronage ensuring the independence and integrity of at least some of the people serving in governmentAs the 20th century dawned and Americans embraced the promise of apolitical government expertise administrative agencies and bureaus proliferated  among them the tiny Bureau of Investigation Founded in 1908 the bureau started out plagued  the very problems Civil Service law was designed  eliminate incompetence corruption and crony appointments Then in 1924 a bustling young direcr named J Edgar Hoover set about whipping the bureau in shape Hoover is often seen day as a tyrant and a violar of civil liberties but when he came  office he was considered a reformer and an enemy of politics a man who could be relied upon  tell the truth when everyone else seemed  be lying for partisan endsThis is one example of how bureaucratic independence can go awry In the mid1970s alarmed  abuses of power during Hoovers nearly 48year direcrship Congress decided that future FBI direcrs should be subject  a 10year limit The policy effectively split the difference between aunomy and accountability The president still had the right  fire an FBI direcr but the law established a standard period of service longer than any presidents two terms One of several things Trumps showdown with Comey calls in question is whether this arrangement is still enough  ensure a reasonable level of FBI independence  especially under a president disinclined  observe political normsTrump seems  believe this is whats happening  him and has lashed out at any agency or hearing that delivers bad news His showdown with the professional Civil Service isnt limited  the intelligence community either At the State Department career employees are faced with proposed budget cuts and White House indifference at the departments of Energy and Education the people in charge seem  have been placed there primarily  undo what their departments do best Trumps decision  fire Comey may have set a particularly dangerous precedent but it is really only one part of a greater crisis of authority that no independent prosecur or commission can entirely fix The enthusiasm for Muellers appointment suggests that independence still holds some power as a political ideal The hard part has always been putting it in practiceBeverly Gage is a professor of American political hisry at Yale She is the author of The Day Wall Street Exploded A Sry of America in Its First Age of Terror and is currently writing a biography of the former FBI direcr J Edgar HooverCollapse,politics
ALBANY  A German couple walked in their apartment building in Harlem one warm evening in 1973 There were shouts screams and two strangers ran out  muggers They ok off down the streetThree men chatting on that block of Riverside Drive West watched  a state official a neighborhood businessman and a newly minted Democratic district leader holding a can of fruit cocktail that he was bringing home He reared back and hurled it at the muggers He missed So the three standers spped standing and started chasingIt was a lot of fun the Democratic leader Herman D Farrell Jr said last week laughing and looking back 44 years  that day past a political lifetime far longer than most and thought of that fast and fearless version of himself Mr Farrell caught up with one of the muggers and grabbed his neck only  be flipped over the mans shoulders and thrown  the ground But the three friends caught both men and Mr Farrell walked away unhurtStaying alive he saidAt age 85 Mr Farrell  everyone has called him Denny since birth  is as familiar a presence in the chamber as the gavel that calls it  order the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee since 1994 He also served as the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee from 2001  2006 and the Manhattan Democratic Party from 1981  2009  the longest tenure in that organizations hisryI believe you can get things done if you control the mechanics he said thenAlong the way Mr Farrell built something elusive among many in his chosen calling a reputation for trustworthiness and for decency in his treatment of rivalsHe is the exemplar of the kind of compromising and dealmaking politician that all of a sudden everybody longs for said Richard L Brodsky a former assemblyman from Westchester He was and still is the most elegant person in that chamberCharles B Rangel the former congressman representing Harlem and Washingn Heights praised his friends candor He would speak his mind he said If youre going  be in for the long run its much easier  know what your true convictions are than  try  remember what you said the last time the question was askedMr Farrell has heard a lot of these sorts of things since he announced his retirement earlier this month Im really impressed  this guy Farrell he said in his Albany office last week and shrugged Next year they wont remember my nameThe son of a tailor he has been known as an impeccable dresser throughout his adult life weaving through his district in Harlem or back and forth  Albany in his cherished convertibles pulling his hair back in a ponytail when the wind blew it in his faceHe said whatever reputation for decorum and for straight talk that he has picked up owes  his upbringing  My mother would whip me if I didnt have class he said  and childhood in HarlemGrowing up we were all different he said Im black Steves Jewish You learned how  insult people without getting killed I can cut you because I know how  cut but on the other hand you know how  do it just rightHe also learned how  learn When I was a child I couldnt decide if I was an idiot or smart because Im dyslexic he said I didnt know what dyslexic was Nor did his teachers He was never a strong student but he learned how  think creatively  solve problems that others managed more easily a strategy of casting a wide net for preparation that he said made him a strong debater in later yearsI cant write a lick but I can do things he said I keep things in my headDavid N Dinkins the former New York City mayor said Mr Farrell had a gift for reading the room before a vote was taken and knowing the outcome The thing he was best at was counting he said last week Its very important  know how  countSeveral political veterans described Mr Farrells most significant defeat as a sort of vicry In 1985 he ran against Edward I Koch in the mayoral primary winning just 13 percent of the vote But his race was later seen as a steppingsne for Mr Dinkins election five years laterJohn LoCicero was on the other side of the 1985 race a longtime adviser  Mr Koch Of all the politicians I have dealt with when hes on my side or against he and I and Koch always had a good relationship Mr LoCicero said When he gave his word that was his bond I never heard anybody put a bad word on DennyJoseph R Lenl another longtime assemblyman said Mr Farrells style stands out day He debates like a gentleman and makes his point and doesnt get nasty he said Maybe its a lost artToday Mr Farrell still stands tall at 6foot4 but leaner than he would like having lost enough weight  send him  the tailors for adjustments  his trademark suits He sps  catch his breath after a walk across a room He said he is experiencing new difficulties with memory and has been he realizes now for about a yearI didnt catch that I was not functioning as well he said I should have quit then before the last legislative session he said After I got through this year I realized I had  get out nowI liked the man Mr Farrell said He was a German who was in a concentration camp and he didnt have  be His wife was Jewish but he wasnt He kept her alive and kept himself aliveMr Farrell was already a grandfather when at age 73 he became a father again with the birth of his daughter Sophia She is now 12 I think it kind of kept him young  have a young daughter Mr Lenl said In announcing his stepping down Mr Farrell repeatedly mentioned her and his wish  spend more time with his familyIve got  get her  focus better he said Shes a whipAs for the future Mr Farrell sees no downside  his generations passing of the rch and in fact sees improvement What really impresses me as I leave is that women will reach an equal place soon he said of the Assembly membership He is promoting Al Taylor his chief of staff as his replacementHe came  me as an intern more than 30 years ago he said I ld him Dont worry Ill be out soon You can take overThe new world he understands Mr Farrell said I dontHe smiled Its a good thing he

In his absorbing new book A Higher Loyalty the former FBI direcr James B Comey calls the Trump presidency a forest fire that is doing serious damage  the countrys norms and traditionsThis president is unethical and untethered  truth and institutional values Comey writes His leadership is transactional ego driven and about personal loyaltyDecades before he led the FBIs investigation in whether members of Trumps campaign colluded with Russia  influence the 2016 election Comey was a career prosecur who helped dismantle the Gambino crime family and he doesnt hesitate in these pages  draw a direct analogy between the Mafia bosses he helped pack off  prison years ago and the current occupant of the Oval OfficeA February 2017 meeting in the White House with Trump and then chief of staff Reince Priebus left Comey recalling his days as a federal prosecur facing off against the Mob The silent circle of assent The boss in complete control The loyalty oaths The usversusthem worldview The lying about all things large and small in service  some code of loyalty that put the organization above morality and above the truth An earlier visit  Trump Tower in January made Comey think about the New York Mafia social clubs he knew as a Manhattan prosecur in the 1980s and 1990s  The Ravenite The Palma Boys Caf GiardinoThe central themes that Comey returns  throughout this impassioned book are the xic consequences of lying and the corrosive effects of choosing loyalty  an individual over truth and the rule of law Dishonesty he writes was central  the entire enterprise of organized crime on both sides of the Atlantic and so o were bullying peer pressure and groupthink  repellent traits shared  Trump and company he suggests and now infecting our cultureWe are experiencing a dangerous time in our country Comey writes with a political environment where basic facts are disputed fundamental truth is questioned lying is normalized and unethical behavior is ignored excused or rewardedA Higher Loyalty is the first big memoir  a key player in the alarming melodrama that is the Trump administration Comey who was abruptly fired  President Trump on May 9 2017 has worked in three administrations and his book underscores just how outside presidential norms Trumps behavior has been  how ignorant he is about his basic duties as president and how willfully he has flouted the checks and balances that safeguard our democracy including the essential independence of the judiciary and law enforcement Comeys book fleshes out the testimony he gave before the Senate Intelligence Committee in June 2017 with considerable emotional detail and it showcases its authors gift for narrative  a skill he clearly honed during his days as United States atrney for the Southern District of New YorkWhat A Higher Loyalty does give readers are some nearcinematic accounts of what Comey was thinking when as hes previously said Trump demanded loyalty from him during a oneonone dinner at the White House when Trump pressured him  let go of the investigation in his former national security adviser Michael T Flynn and when the president asked what Comey could do  lift the cloud of the Russia investigationThere are some methodical explanations in these pages of the reasoning behind the momenus decisions Comey made regarding Hillary Clinns emails during the 2016 campaign  explanations that attest  his nonpartisan and wellintentioned efforts  protect the independence of the FBI but that will leave at least some readers still questioning the judgment calls he made including the different approaches he ok in handling the bureaus investigation in Clinn which was made public and its investigation in the Trump campaign which was handled with traditional FBI secrecyA Higher Loyalty also provides sharp sketches of key players in three presidential administrations Comey draws a scathing portrait of Vice President Dick Cheneys legal adviser David S Addingn who spearheaded the arguments of many hardliners in the George W Bush White House Comey describes their point of view The war on terrorism justified stretching if not breaking the written law He depicts Bush national security adviser and later Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as uninterested in having a detailed policy discussion of interrogation policy and the question of rture He takes Barack Obamas atrney general Loretta Lynch  task for asking him  refer  the Clinn email case as a matter not an investigation Comey tartly notes that the FBI didnt do matters And he compares Trumps atrney general Jeff Sessions  Alber R nzales who served in the same position under Bush writing that both were overwhelmed and overmatched  the job but Sessions lacked the kindness nzales radiatedComey is what Saul Bellow called a firstclass noticer He notices for instance the soft white pouches under Trumps expressionless blue eyes coyly observes that the presidents hands are smaller than his own but did not seem unusually so and points out that he never saw Trump laugh  a sign Comey suspects of his deep insecurity his inability  be vulnerable or  risk himself  appreciating the humor of others which on reflection is really very sad in a leader and a little scary in a presidentDuring his Senate testimony last June Comey was boyscout polite Lordy I hope there are tapes and somewhat elliptical in explaining why he decided  write detailed memos after each of his encounters with Trump something he did not do with Presidents Obama or Bush talking gingerly about the nature of the person I was interacting with Here however Comey is blunt about what he thinks of the president comparing Trumps demand for loyalty over dinner  Sammy the Bulls Cosa Nostra induction ceremony  with Trump in the role of the family boss asking me if I have what it takes  be a made manThroughout his tenure in the Bush and Obama administrations he served as deputy atrney general under Bush and was selected  lead the FBI  Obama in 2013 Comey was known for his fierce goitalone independence and Trumps behavior catalyzed his worst fears  that the president symbolically wanted the leaders of the law enforcement and national security agencies  come forward and kiss the great mans ring Comey was feeling unnerved from the moment he met Trump In his recent book Fire and Fury Michael Wolff wrote that Trump invariably thought people found him irresistible and felt sure early on that he could woo and flatter the FBI direcr in positive feeling for him if not outright submission in what the reader takes as yet another instance of the presidents inability  process reality or step beyond his own narcissistic delusionsAfter he failed  get that submission and the Russia cloud continued  hover Trump fired Comey the following day he ld Russian officials during a meeting in the Oval Office that firing the FBI direcr  whom he called a real nut job  relieved great pressure on him A week later the Justice Department appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the investigation in ties between the Trump campaign and RussiaDuring Comeys testimony one senar observed that the often contradicry accounts that the president

of six false or misleading claims a day a winnertakeall bully with a nihilistic view of the world Be paranoid he advises in one of his own books In another When somebody screws you screw them back in spadesThe other wrote his college thesis on religion and politics embracing Reinhold Niebuhrs argument that the Christian must enter the political realm in some way in order  pursue justice which keeps the strong from consuming the weakUntil his cover was blown Comey shared nature phographs on Twitter using the name Reinhold Niebuhr and both his 1982 thesis and this memoir highlight how much Niebuhrs work resonated with him They also attest  how a harrowing experience he had as a high school senior  when he and his brother were held captive in their parents New Jersey home  an armed gunman  must have left him with a lasting awareness of justice and mortalityLong passages in Comeys thesis are also devoted  explicating the various sorts of pride that Niebuhr argued could afflict human beings  most notably moral pride and spiritual pride which can lead  the sin of selfrighteousness And in A Higher Loyalty Comey provides an invenry of his own flaws writing that he can be stubborn prideful overconfident and driven  egoThose characteristics can sometimes be seen in Comeys account of his handling of the Hillary Clinn email investigation wherein he seems  have felt a moral imperative  address in a July 2016 press conference what he described as her extremely careless handling of very sensitive highly classified information even though he went on  conclude that the bureau recommend no charges be filed against her His announcement marked a departure from precedent in that it was done without coordination with Department of Justice leadership and offered more detail about the bureaus evaluation of the case than usualAs for his controversial disclosure on Oct 28 2016 11 days before the election that the FBI was reviewing more Clinn emails that might be pertinent  its earlier investigation Comey notes here that he had assumed from media polling that Clinn was going  win He has repeatedly asked himself he writes whether he was influenced  that assumption It is entirely possible that because I was making decisions in an environment where Hillary Clinn was sure  be the next president my concern about making her an illegitimate president  concealing the restarted investigation bore greater weight than it would have if the election appeared closer or if Donald Trump were ahead in all polls But I dont knowHe adds that he hopes very much that what we did  what I did  wasnt a deciding facr in the election In testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 3 2017 Comey stated that the very idea that his decisions might have had an impact on the outcome of the presidential race left him feeling mildly nauseous  or as one of his grammatically minded daughters corrected him nauseatedTrump was reportedly infuriated  Comeys nauseous remark less than a week later he fired the FBI direcr  an act regarded  some legal scholars as possible evidence of obstruction of justice and that quickly led  the appointment of the special counsel Robert Mueller and an even bigger cloud over the White HouseIts ironic that Comey who wanted  shield the FBI from politics should have ended up putting the bureau in the midst of the 2016 election firesrm just as its ironic and oddly fitting that a civil servant who has prided himself on being apolitical and independent should find himself reviled  both Trump and Clinn and thrust in the center of another tipping point in hisryThey are ironies that would have been appreciated  Comeys hero Niebuhr who wrote as much about the limits contingencies and unforeseen consequences of human decisionmaking as he did about the dangers of moral complacency and about the necessity of entering the political arena  try  make a differenceWe earn an affiliate commission with each book purchase

WASHINGTON  When it comes  James B Comeys bookur crusade against President Trump the question for hardcore Hillary Clinn fans boils down  this Curse Mr Comey or cheer himCurse him mostlyThey may be cardcarrying members of the Resistance who oppose everything that the president stands for but Mrs Clinns former aides and advisers are still o angry at Mr Comey the former FBI direcr  see past what they view as egregious actions that handed the White House  Mr TrumpThe damage Comey did  the country  the role he played in the election far far surpasses any credit he now gets for calling Trump out said Jared Bernstein who served as one of Mrs Clinns senior economic advisers during the campaign Hisry will remember and judge him for the former not the latterSpeak or conceal  both terrible options he writes in the book which is coming out on Tuesday No matter what we found that act of concealment would be catastrophic  the integrity of the FBI and the Department of Justice Put that way the choice between a really bad option and a catastrophic option was not that hard a call We had  tell Congress that things had changedMrs Clinns most fervent supporters disagree  say the leastSome like Philippe Reines a longtime and trusted Clinn confidant are eager  dig through the pages of Mr Comeys book if only  dissect it point  point looking for inconsistencies or misstatementsIt would be rare for someones book  say This is how I screwed up Mr Reines said But his answers  some really fundamental stuff are just at the very best incomplete At the worst they are just flaut unacceptableLike the rest of his former campaign colleagues Mr Reines is not unaware that Mr Comey is assailing the presidents moral character his inability  tell the truth and his actions that could amount  obstruction of justice And for the record Mr Reines does not disagree with any of itI bought the book I cant wait for it  come from Amazon morrow I do believe Trump is orange and wears tanning glasses he said But that doesnt take away he said from the acute frustration with Jim Comey and wanting  hold him  an accountable standardMr Trump has seized on that frustration  rant about Mr Comey tapping in  and twisting  the Democratic angstIn a tweet Monday morning the president claimed that Mr Comey had drafted a memo exonerating Mrs Clinn long before the email investigation was over The president referenced Mr Comeys handling of the investigation in Mrs Clinns use of a private email server while she was secretary of stateMr Trumps accusations about Mr Comeys handling of the email investigation are different from the ones lodged  her former supporters But gether Mr Trump and Mrs Clinns advisers are diverting the conversation away from Mr Comeys allegations against the presidentMr Comey also said the president lies constantly about matters big and smallThere is not much about which Mrs Clinns supporters agree with Mr Trump But that assessment of Mr Comey is one of themLanny J Davis a lawyer and longtime Clinn associate railed against Mr Comey on Sunday saying on Fox  Friends that Mr Comey was a renegade narcissist who thought that he was above the law as he conducted the email investigationWhat he was really doing was protecting his political rear end with the Republicans because he thought that Hillary Clinn was going  get elected Mr Davis saidKarma really delivered the punch  Comey tweeted Neera Tanden a veteran Clinn loyalist and the president of the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank He helped elect the guy whod fire him   obstruct JusticeIt is possible that Mr Comey thought his book would help douse some of the hatred of him on the political left which he readily acknowledges He wrote that he had heard Mrs Clinn felt she had been shivved  him and added I also know many Democrats are similarly baffled  even outraged   the actions I okBut his explanations for his decisions have largely fallen flat at least among those who lived through the sriesMr Comey writes in the book that he grew  believe that Loretta E Lynch the atrney general and his boss was o close  the Clinns and did not have the credibility with the American people  announce a verdict in the email investigationMs Lynch in a statement disagreedI did what I always do rise above politics and uphold the law she wrote Of Mr Comey she said If he had any concerns regarding the email investigation classified or not he had ample opportunities  raise them with me both privately and in meetings He never didMr Comey writes at length about his decision  hold a news conference in the summer of 2016 announcing that Mrs Clinn would not be prosecuted but also condemning her handling of classified materials as extremely recklessI would do the same thing again at that announcement he writes in his book because I still believe it was the best available alternative  protect and preserve the Department of Justices and the FBIs reservoir of trust with the American peopleFor Mrs Clinns supporters this was Mr Comeys original sin  the moment that he broke with FBI traditions that usually call for nothing more than a brief onesentence declaration when the decision is made not  prosecute And that declaration is usually made  Justice Department officials not the FBIIn a tweet after parts of Mr Comeys book were released last week Mr Reines wrote A Higher Loyalty  whom Comey FBI No Set Bureau back years DOJ No Broke every rule USA No Blew up a candidate Your Oath No Didnt quit Fired Only one thing left  ding ding dingOne response  his tweet came from Jason Chaffetz the former Republican representative from Utah who was often scorching in his criticism of Mrs Clinn The sentiment from the Republican lawmaker  a Democratic loyalist underscored the odd convergence around Mr Comeys bookWe agree from time  time Mr Chaffetz saidEileen Sullivan contributed reportingCollapse,politics

Common SenseIn a period of otherwise extended market calm geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility Even small invesrs have been making bets on the impact politics can have on scks and other asset classes After last weeks selloff I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr Trump might be impeached and if they should sell scksI obviously cant answer the first question As for selling scks my answer as it has been consistently since the election is no at least not because of the troubles swirling around the presidentConsider what has happened in the days since the headlinemaking news By the middle of this week the Standard  Poors 500sck index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the TrumpRussia news broke and on Thursday it closed at a new highBrazils Bovespa index regained much of the ground it lost last week and was in positive terriry for the year  dateWithin a month of Brexit European scks had recovered nearly all their losses This year European sck markets have been notching new highsEven some of Wall Streets most famous and successful invesrs have been struggling this year  turn political upheaval in market gains Paulson  Company and Soros Fund Management two of the bestknown global macro hedge funds which make bets on geopolitical events lost billions last year according  an annual hedge fund ranking compiled  LCH Investments Paul Tudor Joness Tudor Investment another macro fund was flat and Mr Jones recently ld invesrs hes taking on more risk and shifting  more quantitative strategies in an effort  enhance performanceA macro hedge fund index compiled  Hedge Fund Research is down nearly 1 percent since Jan 1 and over 4 percent for the last 12 months one of the worst performing hedge fund indexes Meanwhile the SP 500 gained almost 10 percent in 2016 and is up more than 7 percent this yearBy and large invesrs should tune out political events said James B Stack president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management who has done a study of what he calls crisis events and their effect on markets Hisrically speaking and as a seasoned invesr Id say invesrs should just ignore geopolitical events like Brexit or whatever is happening in BrazilThe problem Mr Stacks research has found is that geopolitical events may be widely feared and there will often be a kneejerk market reaction when theyre unexpected but seldom do they have a lasting impact Underlying economic trends and monetary policy are far more importantMarkus Schomer chief economist at the asset manager PineBridge Investments made a similar point As fundamental invesrs with longer time horizons we try not  be distracted  the political noise he said Ive been telling even our traders with shorter time horizons that what were seeing doesnt really affect the economy or monetary policy which is more important for markets than anything elseMr Stack noted that scks declined sharply after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 2001 But the bear market and recession that followed the technology bubble that exploded in 2000 were already well underway  then September 2001 turned out  be an unusually bad time  sell scks By New Years Day 2002 little more than three months after the post911 low reached on Sept 21 the SP 500 had gained close  20 percentA more recent example was the showdown over the federal debt ceiling in 2011 when Standard  Poors downgraded United States government securities for the first time amid fears the government might default on its debt Scks dropped 15 percent in less than two months and we were on the brink of a bear market Mr Stack said Once the crisis was resolved scks came roaring back and had regained all their losses  yearendOf 11 major geopolitical events examined  Mr Stacks firm only two  the Nazi invasion of France in May 1940 and Japans bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941  led  market losses over oneweek threemonth and oneyear periods and in the case of Pearl Harbor the oneyear decline was less than 1 percentPresident John F Kennedys assassination had no discernible impact Scks were up more than 20 percent a year laterAs geopolitical crises go those were pretty big shocks  markets and invesr psychology So far nothing in the Trump administration has come close Still expectations that Mr Trump and a Republican Congress would succeed in enacting business and shareholderfriendly tax and regulary changes are part of what has driven recent market gainsMr Stack noted that measures of confidence among small businesses chief executives and consumers are at or near record levels Theres no doubt that expectations have accelerated since the election he said So the question is whether political turmoil will turn those expectations upside down leading  a loss of confidence and lower consumer spending That could happen but so far were not seeing any evidence of that he saidHe said comparisons  the Watergateera bear market of 197374 were off base because then the country was in recession the Arab oil crisis sent gasoline prices surging inflation was raging and interest rates hit record highs Arguably President Richard M Nixons abandonment of the gold standard and the transition  marketdetermined currency exchange rates had more  do with plunging sck prices than his crumbling presidencyMr Schomer said a failure  act upon many of Mr Trumps spending and tax proposals might not be such a bad thing for markets given that the United States economy is already at or close  full employment and doesnt need additional stimulus At the end of the day the only reason well have a recession is if the Fed is forced  raise interest rates o quickly unless we have a massive crisis which I dont see happening he saidIf anything hisry suggests that longterm invesrs should buy scks after markets fall on bad geopolitical news not sell But thats not  say this time wont prove  be an exception or that markets wont correct for other reasonsWhatever happens with President Trump the United States is in the ninth year of the secondlongest bull market since World War II none have made it past 10 years Valuations are getting stretched Sooner or later there will be another correction and eventually a bear marketNonetheless Mr Schomer says he sees no imminent end  the bull market Were not going  see a 25 percent surge this year but this economic cycle is so slow and steady with so few imbalances we could end up with 8  10 percent gains the next few years and a much greater degree of overvaluationFor his part Mr Stack said We still believe this market will hit new highs in 2017 but the low volatility and the high valuations suggest this is not a lowrisk market Its not a market in which you should be investing large sums of new capitalCollapse,politics
Common SenseAs Senar Ron Johnson Republican of Wisconsin put it this week Weve got  move on  tax reform so we have a competitive tax system and do it pretty quickly The House Ways and Means Committee continued hearings on tax legislation on WednesdayThe stakes couldnt be higher for Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration all anxious  demonstrate that a party that controls the White House and both houses of Congress can accomplish something significant and deliver on at least one major campaign promiseSo what would be the elements of a tax reform plan that is fair and simple and will stimulate growth  not  mention attract at least 50 Republican votes in the SenateA good place  start say many Republicans and Democrats is the Tax Reform Act of 1986 enacted under President Ronald Reagan with bipartisan supportAlmost everyone it now seems loves itPresident Reagan was willing  lead on tax reform they wrote As a result of that leadership and three years of difficult work in Congress the United States emerged with one of the most modern fair and competitive tax systems in the developed world  one that laid the foundation for decades of American job growthByron Dorgan a former Democratic senar and representative from North Dakota and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee that approved the 1986 bill wrote in The Hill this year It was widely celebrated as a major success We eliminated many deductions and special deals in the tax code used the savings  substantially lower the p tax rate  28 percent and also simplified the tax codeThe 1986 reform also achieved the elusive goal of being revenue neutral meaning it neither expanded the deficit nor entailed an overall tax increase even as it cut the p individual rate from 50 percent  28 percent The p corporate rate declined  34 percent at the time the lowest corporate rate in the developed world from 46 percent The legislation offset the loss of revenue  broadening the base  eliminating a host of deductions exemptions and credits including many abusive tax shelters It also greatly simplified returns for millions of taxpayersLegislars sold the bill  voters as a fair efficient simple spur  economic growth and it proved enormously popular one of Reagans enduring accomplishments The economy and the sck market soared But over the years much of it was undone as lobists and special interests pushed new preferences in the tax codeAs Mr Brady said this week America now has one of the most costly unfair and uncompetitive tax systems in the world The need for progrowth tax reform is urgentSo why not go back  1986 and simply resre the principle that worked so well then  lower tax rates along with a broader base that avoids increasing the deficitIt turns out that many people have tried The most recent example came in 2014 with tax reform legislation drafted  the Ways and Means Committee led at the time  Representative Dave Camp of Michigan a Republican who retired from politics in 2015 The legislation followed 30 congressional hearings dedicated  tax reform and 11 separate bipartisan tax reform working groups led  Mr Camp and Representative Sander Levin of Michigan then the ranking Democrat on the committeeThe Camp reform proposal cut rates and closed loopholes The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would lead  the creation of 18 million jobs and add up  34 trillion  the gross domestic product without adding  the deficit The committee estimated that the bill would save an average middleclass family of four 1300 per year in federal taxesI ok as inspiration the 1986 act Mr Camp ld me this week We adopted the same structure and approach We reduced rates and broadened the base I felt good about thatMr Camps effort drew bipartisan praise I applaud it said C Eugene Steuerle a cofounder and fellow of the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center a key architect of the 1986 reform act and former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy While it needed a few amendments he said over all it was rigorous based on clear principles and didnt rely on magic money  avoid expanding the deficitThe Camp bill never even made it  the House floorYou cant just go back  1986 day said Michael J Graetz a professor and tax specialist at Columbia and Yale law schools who has written extensively about the 1986 act Then there were numerous tax shelters loopholes and other sources of revenue Today theres no pot of gold  pay for the cuts the way there was back in 1986 Mr Graetz saidEven though it nominally cut corporate rates the 1986 act actually shifted much of the tax burden from individuals  corporations Thats not feasible day where lowering the tax burden on corporations is a major goalThat was a reality that Mr Camp had  confront The Camp plan turned out  be a reality test Mr Graetz said There was a lot of pain in the Camp bill in terms of eliminating tax deductions and credits And that only got you  a 25 percent corporate rate President Obama used  say he could get us  28 percent also with a lot of pain But its hard  get the business community excited about 28 percent or 25 percent especially now that the UK is moving  17 percent and Canada is close  thatAnd Mr Camps plan wasnt able  lower individual rates much at all  devising three brackets taxed at 10 percent 25 percent and 35 percent But it phased out certain deductions and exemptions for people making over 400000 a year The Tax Foundation calculated that some taxpayers making more than 400000 would pay a marginal rate as high as 438 percent in effect a tax increase on the wealthy It also hit rich taxpayers  lowering the cap on mortgage deductions  500000 from 1 millionAnd the Camp plan actually raised the p effective rate on capital gains and dividends  248 percent from 238 percent according  the Tax FoundationThat was anathema  many RepublicansSome of the pain inflicted  the Camp plan also hits especially close  the Trump White House since it proposed closing some of the biggest loopholes for real estate developers Mr Camps plan eliminated the break for socalled likekind exchanges which many real estate developers use  delay or avoid capital gains taxAnd the Camp plan proposed longer depreciation schedules reducing the deductions that businesses can take for capital investment and thus increasing taxes for most real estate developers The Trump plan calls for immediate expensing of 100 percent of capital costs eliminating depreciation algether  an enormous windfall for real estate interestsIt should probably come as no surprise that one person who didnt like the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was Mr Trump One of the worst ideas in recent hisry was how he described it in a 1999 oped piece in The Wall Street JournalSuffice it  say that anything resembling the 1986 act would appear  be dead on arrival with this administration and Congress even though many tax experts support such an approachCamps approach is what responsible tax reform should look like and he garnered no support from either Republicans or Democrats Mr Graetz saidThat doesnt mean people are giving up hope Im still optimistic we can conclude tax reform this year said Mr Camp now a senior policy adviser at the tax accounting and consulting firm PwC Hes been encouraged that Trump administration officials have recently reached out  himThe issues

In bars VFW halls offices and living rooms Americans were riveted  the testimony of James B Comey the former FBI direcr before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday a moment of high drama about the conduct of President Trump the workings of American democracy and the threats of Russian involvement in the presidential electionFor some the proceedings were seen through the prism of the partisan divide For others they were less about Democrats and Republicans than about a dyspian sense that American governance has veered off the rails Here are four accounts from around the countryDENVER  The televisions at the Park Tavern in a leafy neighborhood near the Colorado State Capil are usually tuned  sports but on Thursday morning it was wallwall Comey as breakfast regulars sipped latemorning beers and aired their frustration and disgust with a political scandal that had dimmed their views of the presidentHes causing his own demise said Chad Cunningham 45 an Air Force veteran who has voted for Republicans and Democrats but sat out the last presidential election Hes not doing anything for this country except embarrassing usMr Cunningham said the former FBI direcr seemed honest and forthright a man with little  hide and little reason  lie To him Mr Comeys steady detailed delivery made Mr Trumps shootfromthephone Twitter habit seem especially intemperate and cavalier He said he would be perfectly happy if Vice President Mike Pence ok over for Mr TrumpBecause this is not working he saidAs the testimony unfolded on the TV screens Michael OBrien 55 a retired teacher hunched over his tablet earbuds inserted because he said the livestream from PBS was arriving just a few seconds earlier than the cable news feedIm afraid Im going  miss something he saidMr OBrien had nothing kind  say about Mr Trump or Republican politicians and commentars who have defended him and his campaign during the Russia investigation He said he was disturbed  Russian hacking and interference in the last election and was shocked more people were not equally outragedMr OBrien and the woman sitting next  him at the bar Sherry Wing often argue politics When he criticized the president Ms Wing would often respond that the country needed  come gether after a divisive election and give him time  grow in the office She said she still believed that  an extent but as the testimony played overhead she was developing another viewHes just a spoiled rotten ba Ms Wing said Lets move forward What are you going  do  make this country betterMs Wing a registered Republican who tends bar at an American Legion post voted independent last November out of distaste for both Mr Trump and Hillary Clinn She said she was not much fazed  political corruption as old as America or the revelations of Russian meddling in the election a distractionBut Ms Wing was dismayed  what she believed the investigation had revealed about Mr Trumps temperament and characterWhat the hell does this have  do with anything Ms Wing said Bring back our jobs Bring back our dignity JACK HEALYGROVETOWN Ga  The water wer here includes a rendering of an American flag and just above Grovewns name d Bless America Soldiers from Fort rdon fill restaurants gas stations and retail shopsBut though it was easy  find a television beaming out Mr Comeys remarks many people found other things  focus onI think a lot of people have run with one little bit and now its a big mess said Deborah Barnes 61 who has run Hairys Barber Shop for about 18 years I would argue a lot of people  just regular Joes  see it the same way and thats why they elected Donald TrumpMs Barnes dressed in a black barbers smock with Debbie embroidered in red had the hearing on in her shop About an hour in Mr Comeys testimony her cusmers had paid little attention she saidI dont even think that anybody noticed it being on she said Theyre just interested in getting a haircutAlthough Ms Barnes said she was paying some attention  the days proceedings she said she viewed the hearing as unlikely  settle any of the questions that have dogged Mr Trumps presidencyIt is a big mess said Ms Barnes who does not use Twitter and said she was a sparing user of Facebook In my opinion some of the senars are just out  get anythingShe added Whether youre Democrat or Republican your president is your damn presidentIn near Augusta Santria Swinn 32 was watching the hearing as she cleaned at a hotel where the asking rate for a room on Thursday night was 97 As she moved among rooms on the fourth floor she was switching televisions  CNN so she could listen  Mr ComeyI just want  know whats going on she said as she paused for a moment at the door of Room 409 the white comforter on its bed already adjusted just so Im just taking it all in Im just nosyAt the Harlem Ga Huddle House across the street from a mural of Laurel and Hardy the Comey hearing was playing on one television and ESPN on another But neither appeared  be getting much attentionA family sat in a booth closest  the television where Fox News was playingI just think its propaganda Erin Mallory 39 said as she sod behind the counter and a child screamed from elsewhere in the restaurantMs Mallory said she would catch up on Mr Comeys comments laterI think its just more noise she said ALAN BLINDERCHICAGO  In a quiet back room of a bakery here three friends gathered Thursday  sip coffee watch CNN and analyze every syllable Mr Comey said about a president they loatheI didnt want  see the highlights said Chris Sne 40 who ok the day off from his job in advertising  watch the hearing I didnt want  see the spin afterwards I really was looking for the direct conversationsA couple of hours in Mr Sne said he heard enough  conclude that Mr Trump  a man he described as awful and dirty  had tried  manipulate Mr ComeyI think this is just the tip of the spear in terms of this investigation Mr Sne saidSeated next  him Tari Toppe 42 said she thought there was possibly enough information now  pursue impeachment of Mr TrumpI was kind of hoping they would get enough out of this  look in obstruction of justice said Ms Toppe a massage therapist and stayathome motherTheir friend Kira Kurka 43 was enjoying a carrot cake muffin and paying close attention for any evidence that Mr Trump may have colluded with Russia When Mr Comey dodged a question on that pic Ms Kurka responded with displeasure Come on give an answer she said Thats why were hereBut even Mr Comeys nonanswer spoke volumes Ms Kurka said He has something he just cant say its something that has  be in a closeddoor session because its something big that could maybe lead  impeachment speculated Ms Kurka a phographer who said she was procrastinating on work in order  watch the hearingMr Sne Ms Toppe and Ms Kurka all voted for Mrs Clinn in last years presidential election and all expressed fears about the state of American democracy under Mr TrumpBut the three friends agreed that Mr Comeys public testimony was a positive step a sign that investigars were taking the Russia issue seriously and that wrongdoers might be held accountableThey credited senars from both parties who asked ugh questions They scoffed as Republicans kept mentioning Mrs Clinns email serverMr Sne said the hearing had been a good thing for transparency for the American people And he said patience was needed as the investigation continued  unfoldHopefully Mr Sne said Americans arent expecting that this is going  be a quick conclusion MITCH SMITHPHOENIX  A burlesque dancer a former Army ranger and a  Depot

everyone wanted  hear what Mr Comey had  sayAt the bar located on a busy corner between a checkcashing center and a Mexican restaurant the political persuasions vary but many regulars are united  their distaste for politics these days The dancer Kitty Vicrian voted for Hillary Clinn The ranger Abel Candelaria voted for Donald Trump The salesman Terry Gaines did not bother  cast a ballot last NovemberIn this slice of Arizona a state that last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996 the debate around the bar on Thursday was not about red or blue ideology or about who was right  Mr Comey or Mr Trump There was only sporadic interest in what was being said and instead a dismissive sense about politics in generalThe whole thing is a circus said Mr Gaines 64 referring  the senars who are beholden  their constituents and Mr Comey who probably has his own agenda Then he returned  his plate of hash browns and scrambled eggsThe only time when everyone seemed  be paying attention was when Senar John McCain of Arizona asked Mr Comey about his investigation in Mrs Clinns emailsArent we talking about Russia Ms Larsyn asked her eyes trained on the screenIn the bar at least the conversation veered ward Russia and whether it interfered in the elections which pretty much everyone agrees is pretty crazy Ms Larsyn saidMr Gaines recalled the weekly duckandcover in

LettersTo the EdirI beg  differ with Susan Chira who posits the notion that the furor over Kellyanne Conways couchlounging posture in the Oval Office was mostly sexist in origin If Sean Spicer were sprawled on that sofa with his feet propped up on a coffee table the outcry would be the sameWhere is the respect for the most hallowed office in the White House Where is the respect for the presidents of hisrically black colleges who were gathered in that room and the presidency itselfFurthermore Ms Conway may well be the victim of sexist comments in other regards but carping about the clothing of politicians has been a national sport since the days of George Washingn well before there were women in officeHas Ms Chira missed the double entendres fired at President Trump and his ties or those aimed at Sean Spicers tailorTo the EdirHillary Clinn and Kellyanne Conway may both be ambitious assertive women but the similarities end thereMrs Clinn has devoted her entire life  public service  as first lady senar and secretary of state fighting relentlessly for womens rights and human rights worldwide No small accomplishments considering that she entered the work force in the 1970s a time when women were often expected  stay home take care of the kids and bake chocolate chip cookiesMs Conway however hardworking she has proved  be in the past year has devoted herself  one task  defending Donald Trump The attacks against her may be offensively sexist but they are not rooted in the persistent anger ward women who step outside conventional rolesHer role is as conventional as could be  that of the loyal assistant protecting her often embarrassing and profligate bossCATHY BERNARD NEW YORKTo the EdirFor years I have decried the irrelevant remarks about appearance that turned up in the media and in casual conversation about powerful women such as Hillary ClinnAfter reading your article focusing on this issue with regard  Kellyanne Conway I realized that despite my efforts  assess our female leaders based on the performance of their duties I was guilty of maligning Ms Conway for her looksMany thanks  Susan Chira for making me aware that I was as guilty as the meanspirited critics who undermined Mrs Clinn with their comments about her pantsuitsTo the EdirIm no fan of Kellyanne Conways politics but in the aftermath of the hoopla surrounding the pho of her kneeling on the Oval Office couch I have  wonder Would Steve Bannon also an adviser  the president have been asked  step back and take a snapshot of a roomful of distinguished menTo the EdirThe White House is not Kellyanne Conways home It is the Peoples House and she is a guestemployee in it She should understand that it was inappropriate for any adult male or female  strike such an informal pose at an Oval Office receptionGAIL MINTHORN WILTON CONNTo the EdirI agree with Susan Chira in her derision of overthep misogynistic jabs aimed at powerful women in politics that appear in tweets Facebook and on comedy programs such as Saturday Night Live However it may be worth noting that the three tweets used as examples in the article were written  womenThe term misogynist usually connotes a male bias against women So when the mocking or hateful missiles are thrown  women against women do we call this misogyny No perhaps not Perhaps it just comes with the terriryAfter all we have always heard or seen comical caricatures of male politicians  jokes about John Boehners tan or carons of Barack Obama accentuating his ears or pratfalls performed as imitations of Gerald Ford Perhaps we are merely experiencing the rise of women  powerful positions that put them in the limelight Bravo for themTo the EdirIm sorry that our current president expects female White House employees  dress like women  clones of news anchors in their constraining sleeveless shift dresses Im sorry that Kellyanne Conway had  conrt her body while wearing these binding clothes in order  take phos Im sorry that I will not accept an accusation of being sexist for being put off when any illmannered person male or female puts his or her dirty shoes on the presidents couchIts 2017 female White House staffers If you need  do acrobatics  do your job be a little bold and consider wearing trousers  work I promise it wont turn you in a Democrat You just might be able  move and even breathe a bit more comfortably A little more blood flowing  brains in the White House will always be a fashionable choiceTo the EdirSusan Chiras article tries the evenhanded approach that The New York Times and other media adopted during the 2016 campaign Yes Kellyanne Conway has drawn some misogynistic attacks she has also invited such attacks through behavior and yes appearance that would be considered flatly unacceptable from a man in her position Your sry also does a disservice  the many other women who have represented administrations  and for that matter covered news  in equally charged situationsThe criticism of Kellyanne Conway is all about Ms Conways conduct and demeanor To call her out using misogynistic terms is impolite impolitic and wrong but  say that she lies disrespects the United States and needs  look in the mirror before looking in the camera are all within boundsSo other than an overdose of political correctness what justified putting this article on your front pageTo the EdirANDREA B HALE NEW YORKTo the EdirWhy is it that when there is constructive criticism against a woman it is called sexist or even worse misogynist Men get criticized all the time   both men and women If women are going  be successful in these high political jobs theyll have  take the constructive criticismThere are women in public life who are not criticized and it is because they are good at their jobs but when someone criticizes a Sarah Palin or a Kellyanne Conway it is usually justified and it shouldnt be misconstrued as sexist or misogynist Criticism can be constructive  and thats not an alternative

21year FBI veteranFBI Deputy Direcr Andrew McCabe is racing the clock  retire with full benefits 90 days  goPensions are set through a formula based on past salaries and years of service The value of Mr McCabes pension and how much might be in jeopardy was not immediately clearUnder FBI rules internal reports are referred  the bureaus Office of Professional Responsibility which makes disciplinary recommendations Mr McCabe can appeal that recommendation  the atrney general A Justice Department spokeswoman declined  say whether Mr McCabe would be firedThe department follows a prescribed process  which an employee may be terminated said the spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores That process includes recommendations from career employees and no termination decision is final until the conclusion of that process We have no personnel announcements at this timeMr McCabe is a career agent not a political appointee so Mr Trump has no direct say in his fate The decision nonetheless comes at a moment of turnover in Mr Trumps national security team On Tuesday the president fired the secretary of state Rex W Tillerson and named the CIA direcr Mike Pompeo  replace him He tapped a veteran clandestine

longtime ally of the ClinnsMrs McCabe lost the race and Mr McCabe was later promoted  deputy direcr where he oversaw the investigation in Mrs Clinn No charges were filed in that case and Mr Trump has

job that has become an integral part of the nations intelligence communityThe deputy direcr is the chief operations officer at the FBI a job that requires managing relationships with the White House and Congress That task became unusually difficult as agents investigated the Trump campaign straining relationships with Mr Trump Democrats in Congress meanwhile criticized the FBI for failing  do enough in that inquiry while Republicans accused agents of drumming up an investigation based on shoddy evidence,politics
Since Election Day there has been an abundance of liberal hyperbole about the dangers of a Trump administrationThere is however a good chance that they are dead rightDonald Trump has amassed such a collection of FourPinocchio ratings  59 in all  that  himself hes earned as many in this campaign as all other Republicans or Democrats combined in the past three yearsthe continuous alteration of the past and in the long run probably demands a disbelief in the very existence of objective truthIn addition  winning the Elecral College in a landslide I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegallyOn Dec 9 the Washingn Post published a sry on the CIAs assessment that American intelligence agencies hadidentified individuals with connections  the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others including Hillary Clinns campaign chairman according  US officials Those officials described the individuals as acrs known  the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation  boost Trump and hurt Clinns chancesThese are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction The election ended a long time ago in one of the biggest Elecral College vicries in hisry Its now time  move on and Make America Great AgainTo have the presidentelect of the United States simply reject the factbased narrative that the intelligence community puts gether because it conflicts with his a priori assumptions  wowThe ongoing conflict over the intelligence agencys analysis of Russian involvement has become the first major test of Trumps altreality visionThe facts are stubborn things They did hack in this campaignThere is method  Trumps madness Despite the nine lives he has demonstrated he seems eager  avoid a damaging challenge  his legitimacy as the nations chief executive intent on defining his election as a massive landslide vicry and one of the great vicries of all timeUniformity and order are authoritarian watch words Authoritarians obey They seek order They follow authoritarian leaders They eschew diversity fear the other act aggressively ward others and once they have identified friend from foe hold tight  their decisionTheres no such thing unfortunately anymore as facts And so Mr Trumps tweets among a certain crowd  a large part of the population  are truth When he says that millions of people illegally voted he has some facts  among him and his supporters  and people believe they have facts  back that up Those that do not like Mr Trump they say that those are lies and theres no facts  back it upOr as Corey Lewandowski Trumps former campaign manager and current adviser puts itThis is the problem with the media You guys ok everything that Donald Trump said so literally The American people didntOwnership of this phenomenon is not the exclusive property of the right Democrats liberals and academics have made significant if unknowing contributions  the credulity of Trumps supportersProponents of globalization Rodrik argues have in recent decades downplayed the costs of trade on the implicit premise thatthere are barbarians on only one side of the trade debate Apparently those who complain about World Trade Organization rules or trade agreements are awful protectionists while those who support them are always on the side of the angelsThe result is that many in the economics professionhave consistently minimized distributional concerns even though it is now clear that the distributional impact of say the North American Free Trade Agreement or Chinas entry in the World Trade Organization were significant for the most directly affected communities in the United Stateslesseducated white voters had a solid economic rationale for voting against the status quo  nearly all the gains from the economic recovery have passed them Since Nov 7 2007 according  Porter Hispanics have gained nearly 5 million jobs AfricanAmericans and AsianAmericans have each gained over 2 million jobs but whites have lost nearly 1 million jobs Those job losses were heavily concentrated in those Rust Belt and relatively speaking more rural states where Trump racked up his Elecral College winThe credibility of the Democratic Party generally among Trump voters is at an alltime low as Democratic candidates discovered on Nov 8This Democratic vulnerability was explored in depth  Katherine Cramer a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin in a book on voters in that state The Politics of Resentment which came out in March In her study Cramer described the three elements of rural consciousnessFirst a belief that rural areas are ignored  decision makers including policy makers second a perception that rural areas do not get their fair share of resources and third a sense that rural folks have fundamentally distinct values and lifestyles which are misundersod and disrespected  city folksThe result she argues is the creation of a rural identity infused with a sense of distributive injustice much of it focused on liberal policies directing tax dollars  urban racial minoritiesThese rural voters and others in the Trump coalition are more than willing  give Trump the benefit of the doubt Their deep feeling that whatever else he was he was on their side permitted him  shrug off criticism as emanating from malevolent political elitesTrumps attempt  subvert truth is a major challenge  democratic governance In this context it may be wise  listen  the predictions of Masha Gessen Despite losing the popular vote Trump has secured as much power as any American leader in recent hisry she writes in The New York Review of Books essay I mentioned earlier He will want  maintain and increase it  his ideal is the talitarianlevel popularity numbers of Vladimir PutinHaving watched in frustration as Trump ran roughshod over the party establishment and all of its candidates Republicans are actually more likely than Democrats  recognize the potential threat posed  the presidentelect Because of this  in the strange pathways of politics  the hearings on alleged Russian hacking will become not only an inquiry in cyber espionage but also a forum for Republican leaders  put Trump in his place and  set limits on his presidencyCollapse,politics
Most tech executives and employees remain supportive of Democrats especially on social and cultural issues The Republican tilt of the PACs at Microsoft Amazon ogle and Facebook suggests however that as these companies domains grow larger their botmline interests are becoming increasingly aligned with the policies of the Republican PartyIn 2016 the Microsoft PAC gave 478818  Republican House candidates and 272000  Democratic House candidates It gave 164000  Republican Senate candidates and 75000  Democratic Senate candidatesThis was not small change In 2016 Microsoft employees gave a tal

minority 29 percent of tech company founders described labor unions as good compared  73 percent of Democrats Asked is mericracy naturally unequal tech founders overwhelmingly agreedFerenstein went onOne hundred percent of the smaller sample of founders  whom I presented this question said they believe that a truly mericratic economy would be mostly or somewhat unequal This is a key distinction Opportunity is about maximizing peoples potential which founders tend  believe is highly unequal Founders may value citizen contributions  society but they dont think all citizens have the potential  contribute equally When asked what percent of national income the p 10 would hold in such a scenario a majority 67 of founders believed that the richest individuals would control 50 or more of tal income while only 31 of the public believes such an outcome would occur in a mericratic societyOne of the most interesting questions posed  Ferenstein speaks  middle and working class anxieties over global competitionIn international trade policy some people believe the US government should create laws that favor American business with policies that protect it from global competition such as fees on imported goods or making it costly  hire cheaper labor in other countries outsourcing Others believe it would be better if there were less regulations and businesses were free  trade and compete without each country favoring their own industries Which of these statements come closest  your beliefThere was a large difference between tech company officials 73 percent of whom chose free trade and less regulation while only 20 percent of Democrats supported those choicesJoel Kotkin a fellow in urban studies at Chapman University who writes about demographic social and economic trends sees these differences as the source of deep conflict within the Democratic PartyThe disruptive force is largely Silicon Valley a natural oligarchy that now funds a party teetering ward populism and even socialism The fundamental contradictions as Karl Marx would have noted lie in the collision of interests between a group that has come  epimize selfconsciously progressive megawealth and a mass base which is increasingly concerned about downward mobilityThe tech elite Kotkin writes far from deserting the Democratic Party more likely will aim take  take it over Until very recently theconflict between populists and tech oligarchs has been muted in large part due  common views on social issues like gay marriage and  some extent environmental protection But as the social issues fade having been won  progressives the focus necessarily moves  economics where the gap between these two factions is greatestKotkin sees future partisan machination in cynical termsOne can expect the oligarchs  seek out a modus vivendi with the populists They could exchange a regime of higher taxes and regulation for everexpanding crony capitalist opportunities and political protection As the hegemons of day

Why is immigration such a problem for the Democratic PartyIn the fall of 2015 as the presidential campaign began  heat up Hillary Clinn broke with the Obama administration over its ongoing deportation of undocumented immigrantsI think we have  go back  being a much less harsh and aggressive enforcer We need  of course take care of felons and violent people I mean that goes without saying But I have met o many people in our country who were upright productive people who maybe had some you know minor offense Like you know maybe they were  arrested for speeding or they had some kind of  you know one incident of drunk driving something like that 25 years agoClearly Clinns attack on Obamas relatively stringent deportation policy was devised  maximize Hispanic turnout in the 2016 electionDid the strategy work The evidence is mixedIn any analysis of the 2016 vote it is difficult  separate the issues of immigration and free trade In an Ocber 2016 report Pew found that Trump voters were decisively more hostile  both free trade agreements and immigration than the general public and much more hostile than Clinn supportersThis data demonstrates a key element in the politics of immigrationindividuals who pose a clear risk  national security serious felons repeat offenders or individuals with a lengthy criminal record of any kind known gang members or other individuals who pose a clear danger  public safety and individuals with an egregious record of immigration violations including those with a record of illegal reentry and those who have engaged in immigration fraudOn the other hand with an eye  the Hispanic vote and immigration supporters the administration called for prosecurial discretion meaning the relaxation of enforcement if not the ending of enforcement algether in the case of undocumented immigrants in the following categoriesVeterans and members of the US armed forces longtime lawful permanent residents minors and elderly individuals individuals present in the United States since childhood pregnant or nursing women victims of domestic violence trafficking or other serious crimes individuals who suffer from a serious mental or physical disability and individuals with serious health conditionsObamas policies produced results  particularly the administrations success in deporting those with serious criminal records  that served him well in the 2012 election and in all likelihood would ordinarily have worked for the Democratic candidate in 2016But in the 2016 election Clinn was under strong pressure from immigration advocacy groups  move  a significantly more liberal stance than the position Obama had adoptedThis wasnt just Clinns doing of course For the past fifty years the Democratic Party has been the moving force behind rights movements generally including prominently immigrant rights Over that same time period the Republican Party has been and still is the political arm of those opposed  the expansion of civil rights This division has been a mixed blessing for both partiesThe political advantage of prorights positioning for the Democrats is that it has put the party at the forefront of social and cultural movements that have steadily gained public acceptance The payoff was evident in Bill Clinns vicries in 1992 and 1996 and in Obamas in 2008 and 2012The political disadvantage emerges when a majority of voters see the Democratic Party as o far out in front of the elecrate  as the proponent of new rights that do not yet have majority support Republicans reaped the benefits of Democratic overreach in the 1980 election of Ronald Reagan the wave midterm elections of 1994 2010 and 2014 and the Nov 8 election of Donald TrumpI asked a number of political operatives and election analysts for their views on these volatile issues There was no consensusSteve Murphy a Democratic campaign consultant argues that the power of antiimmigrant messages will be shortlivedTrump and other Republicans he wrote aresimply going for a higher percentage of white votes with bigotry ward ALL people of color America is headed ward majority minority status and these Republicans are simply betting on a white backlash Last year they got it with a record percentage of the white vote Will it continue  grow Hisry says these racist waves eventually crash on the shoals of decencyOthers disagreedSimon Rosenberg president and founder of NDN formerly the New Democratic Network a centerleft think tank in Washingn has his own argumentDemocrats will have a hard time winning this debate unless we acknowledge peoples legitimate concerns about having a functioning border and keeping people safe Countering Trump will require us  lean in Obamas success at halting the unauthorized flow in the country and preventing foreign fighter terror attacks on US soil We can be for legalizing the 11 million and more generous immigration policies while also being for a strong border and counterterrorism efforts They arent mutually exclusive and shouldnt be seen that wayThen addressing the 2016 campaign Rosenberg saidThe Clinn campaign did not adequately rebut or even really address the xenophobic open bordersweak on terror arguments Trump made and I think it hurt her particularly in the parts of the country where immigrants havent been settling in large numbersNolan McCarty a political scientist at Princen put it this wayPurely in terms of politics and strategy the Democrats have played immigration badly They have allowed their position  be associated with open borders and sanctuary cities They have based their opposition  the immigration restrictionists in terms of identity politics rather the economic benefits of wellmanaged immigration This has caused them  be deaf  concerns that many voters have about the effects of immigration on wages and public services While I do not think the evidence shows immigration has these alleged harms the Democrats have  do better than dismiss all opposition  immigration as racismMcCarty specifically disputed the argument that Clinns lenient position was a net plus because it was crucial in mobilizing Hispanic votersIt was probably her underperformance in mobilizing AfricanAmericans that hurt her most and they are generally the group least enthusiastic about open door immigration policiesJonathan Haidt a social psychologist at NYU ok a similar but broader view in disagreeing with Clinns immigration strategyPolitical thinkers going back  Hobbes have noted that people crave safety and will give up many freedoms  a strong leader or state if it can deliver safety In the 1970s and 1980s the Democrats were seen as being on the side of those accused of crime  they reflexively sided with the accused  defend their rights and fight systemic prejudice This made them easy targets for the Republicans who became the party of law and order under Nixon and ReaganNow in Haidts view adoption of a very liberal immigration stance carries substantial liabilitiesIn these times of heightened fear of ISIS attacks and slow economic growth if you are seen  favor open borders or  not be concerned about illegal immigration you will be an easy target for the party of law and orderIt is however possible that Trumps excesses will revive support for an immigration policy somewhere between Obamas and ClinnsAdam Bonica a political scientist at Stanford said that in looking ward the futureeverything points  a strategic advantage for the Democrats in promoting immigration and the core values of decency and inclusiveness that their base stands forI asked Marc Farinella a former political consultant and the executive direcr of the Project on Political Reform at the University of Chicagos Harris School of Public Policy about the direction of the debate going forward and he wrote backTrump has left the Democrats an enormous amount of running room on this issue From a strictly strategic perspective all Democrats have  do  capitalize politically is sound more compassionate and stand up against excessive government oppressionIn the process the partycould also reap additional political rewards  giving voice  Americans desire for fairness and concerns about cheating and safetyFarinella added that Democrats would benefit politically  making itclear that while they oppose amnesty they do support a path  citizenship for longtime lawabiding and productive undocumented residents that has real work and assimilation requirements and recognize that we do have  have efforts  identify and remove violent criminals and improve border securitySpeaking exclusively in terms of the politics of the issue all theyll have  do is sound reasonable humane and compassionateFarinellas analysis sounds logical but after an election that gave the White House  Donald Trump the argument that vicry will go  the candidate who sounds reasonable humane and compassionate is no longer persuasiveCollapse,politics

OpEd ContriburThe simmering talk of impeachment swirling around President Trump largely concerns whether he committed a crime  asking James Comey when he was still the direcr of the FBI  end an investigation of Michael T Flynn the onetime national security adviser From the perspective of criminal law the resulting questions which pertain mainly  the presidents intent in making the request are inescapable From the perspective of the decidedly political act of impeachment they are irrelevant The purpose of impeachment is not punitive It is prophylacticCriminal law looks backward ward offenses committed The object of impeachment is not  exact vengeance It is  protect the public against future acts of recklessness or abuse Consequently the issue in deciding whether Mr Trump is liable  impeachment is less what happened in the Oval Office between him and Mr Comey than what those events say about what will happen in similar situations in the future That is not a case for casual impeachment On the contrary since it is harder  predict future acts than  prove what has already occurred such a standard may be harder  meetOur tendency  read the impeachment power in an overly legalistic way which is ratified  230 years of excessive timidity about its use obscures the political rather than juridical nature of the device The Constitution applies presidential impeachment  Treason Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors The famous latter phrase does not refer  offenses like burglary on the one hand or loitering on the other If it did impeachment would be available for casual transgressions which no framer of the Constitution intendedThe phrase dates in American constitutionalism  the founder George Masons proposal  make the president liable  impeachment not just for treason and bribery  the original formulation at the Constitutional Convention  but also for what he called maladministration His fellow framer James Madison objected  the vagueness of the term so Mason substituted high Crimes and Misdemeanors That phrase in turn is traceable  the British legal commentar William Blacksne a contemporary who was revered in colonial America who applied it  the maladministration of high officers among other thingsThe tendency  read high Crimes and Misdemeanors o literally is one reason the 25th amendment which treats presidential incapacity as though it requires a special constitutional mechanism when in fact one was already in place became necessary It is also why in a development that surely would have surprised Hamiln and Madison alike the republic has managed 23 decades without a successful impeachment and conviction the resignation of President Richard Nixon notwithstandingThe political nature of the impeachment authority does not mean it is merely a contest over power Still less is it supposed  rehash elecral disputes Instead the point is that because its purpose is  defend the community rather than  punish an individual the standards of a criminal trial do not apply The Constitutions specification that prosecuting an individual for an act for which he or she was impeached does not constitute double jeopardy reinforces this understandingThe prophylactic rather than punitive character of the impeachment power still of course requires an offense But the offense indicates a pattern on the basis of which future behavior can be predicted The idea is not  humiliate the president or  cause him  suffer  the loss of his office It is  protect the public against his negligence or abuseIn this sense it does not matter whether Mr Trump explicitly intended  obstruct justice when he reportedly attempted  cajole Mr Comey The determination Congress must make is what its level of confidence is that Mr Trump can be trusted not  abuse the levers of power in similar ways if he continues  hold them On another front there is little question that he committed no crime when he leaked classified information  the Russian ambassador But that o is not the question impeachment poses The issue is whether Madisons community and Hamilns society need  be defended against similar behavior in the futureThere are reasonable arguments  be made that despite all the controversies the president can demonstrate the discipline his office requires Others may assert that the acts of which he is accused did not occur did not occur the way they were reported or did not constitute high crimes or misdemeanors if they did occurThe evidence should be carefully gathered a process in which Robert S Mueller III acting as special counsel will help considerably But Mr Mueller is no substitute for Congresss independent responsibilities of investigation and sober evaluation The question is  what standards they should conduct this work and that question provides an opportunity  correct the mistaken assumption according  which presidents can forfeit the public trust only  committing what the law recognizes as a crime That is a poor bar for a mature republic  set It is not the one a newborn republic establishedAnd that is why the idea that the conversation about impeachment is simply a political persecution of a man who is technically innocent of a literal crime not only jumps the investigary gun It misses the constitutional pointCollapse,politics
Mr President 172000 West Virginians got insurance for the first time These are working people but theyve got something they never had before They dont know how they got it they dont know who gave it  them they dont know the Democrats nothing about Its Obamacare They dont know any of that All they know is theyve got it And you know what They voted for you Mr President The Democrats gave it  them but they voted for you Theyre going  know who ok it away from themDuring the campaign Trump appeared  fully grasp Manchins pointEven after he won the presidency Trump maintained his pro forma commitment  social insuranceWhat in fact would the Trumpbacked measure passed  the House last week actually doThe distributional impact of the tax provisions is most apparent in the highest income brackets those in the p one percent whose household income is more than 770000 would get an average tax cut of 37220 Those in the p 01 percent who make 4 million or more would get an average reduction of 207240the proposed changes  Medicaid under AHCA would disproportionately affect lowincome individuals and people of color for whom the program is a central source of coverage Medicaid covers over half of all poor families one in five adults of color and over half of children of colorJudith Solomon vice president for health policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities described some of the AHCA changes in Medicaid in an emailBeginning in 2020 Solomon wrotestates can freeze enrollment and only cover the grandfathered enrollees who were enrolled on 123119 The block grant option allows states  cut eligibility The only requirement would be  cover pregnant women and children under age 6 with incomes under 138 of the poverty line and children 6  18 below the poverty lineAlong similar lines Matthew Fiedler a Brookings fellow wrote meThe two most important Medicaid provisions under the AHCA are 1 cutting federal funding for covering the ACA Medicaid expansion population and 2 implementing a per capita cap that would limit the tal amount of federal funding states could receive per person they enroll Both provisions would give states very strong incentives  curtail eligibility but neither would directly require states  do soJust as the tax changes in the Republican bill flow  the rich so do the health care benefitsThose making less than 10000ayear would lose an average of about 1400 or nearly onethird of their income  under the AHCA relative  the ACA Middleincome households those making 50000  75000 would see little change  an average increase in net government transfers of about 60 However those making 200000 or more would receive an average net increase in government support of 5640 or 11 percent of their incomeGleckman explained that thedecline in wellbeing for lowincome people would result from the AHCAs proposals  cut the federal contribution  Medicaid and its move  eliminate costsharing subsidies for lowerincome households that buy nongroup insurance thus raising their deductibles and copaysallow for people with preexisting conditions  be charged more per year for their insurance coverage  possibly  the tune of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars more per yearresult in millions of Americans losing their health care coverage and could make coverage unaffordable for people with preexisting conditionsFrom another vantage point one with political significance maps created  the Kaiser Family Foundation show how individuals of different ages and incomes would fare if the AHCA replaces ObamacareThe affluent come out ahead Older voters with modest incomes  a core element of Trumps support  would be penalized paying more for health coverage in almost every section of the countryThe accompanying Kaiser map shows the sections of the country where a 60yearold making 30000ayear would pay more in orange or less in blue in 2020 The only places where such an individual would pay less are in New York and MassachusettsThe consequences of the House bill if it is enacted in law are plain  seeMark A Peterson a professor of public policy political science and law at UCLA put the case in straightforward terms in an emailThe Medicaid cuts and caps would withdraw coverage from large swaths of the poor the working poor and lowerpaid working class individuals who do not have access  affordable employersponsored insurance The shift  the tax credits for insurance purchase would mean that many working and lowermiddleclass individuals and families would be unable  afford insurance The weakening of the preexisting condition protections and the reliance on usually problematic highrisk pools would be most detrimental  people with those conditions who are not in the higher ranks of incomeBenjamin Sommers a professor of health policy and economics at Harvards School of Public Health was similarly directThe AHCA repeals hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes on highincome households and insurance companies while reducing the Obamacare tax credits that helped lower and middle income families purchase health insurance The changes  Medicaid are even more dramatic with more than 800 billion dollars in federal money for the program cut over the next decade  this will have a huge impact on the 70 million lowerincome children adults disabled individuals and elderly who currently rely on Medicaid for their health careAdd in the termination of the taxes of investment income and the higher tax obligations in general of more affluent individuals and the AHCA would lead  a dramatic shift of resources away from the poor working class and lower middle class especially for people with jobs outside of the realm of large employersAs is always the case in legislation as complex as health care the devil is in the details the significance of which is often hidden from the general public It is these details that ultimately determine the winners and the losers of any legislative programFor many years some conservatives have berated the political left for waging class war whenever the left suggested that conservative policies helped  further enrich the wealthy at the expense of the poorIn a harsh critique Aaron addedThe AHCA is stunning in its shamelessness and baldness Even allowing for the fact that Republicans will be ashamed and embarrassed if after seven years of promising  repeal and replace they were  do nothing it is difficult  understand why the shame of voting for so egregious and contemptible a piece of legislation did not cause more of them  find it impossible  vote for itThe most surprising aspect of the politics of the AHCA is that  and large the winners cast majorities for Clinn and the losers backed Trumpvoters hit the hardest  eligible for at least 5000 less in tax credits under the Republican plan  supported Mr Trump  a margin of 59 percent  36 percentAffluent constituencies that cast pluralities or majorities for Hillary Clinn actually gained from the measureConservative tax reform  perhaps better described as radical tax cuts for the rich  is the very highest priority issue on the Republican legislative agenda It is also dear  Trumps heartIn order  get any tax overhaul through the Senate with a simple majority the tax bill under Senate rules cant increase the federal deficit Since the health care bill would cut the federal deficit it makes it easier  come back later and pass more tax cutsis an old one divide and rule The rich guy convinced much of the white working class that he would take back the country from the rest of the working class and other undeserving nonwhite and nonChristian people as well as the coastal elites giving those folks jobs and handouts at the expense of real Americans Its a strategy as old as this countryDunlap is on target But its one thing  gut regulations and change tax rates  benefit the affluent and another thing algether  take away someones health care coverage Voters who are denied medical care or find themselves unable  pay bills from docrs or hospitals are unlikely  be receptive  a campaign that seeks  divide and rule no matter how receptive they may have been in 2016Collapse,politics

highlight how Democrats are themselves bound  hogtied is not o strong a word   the conflicting needs and goals of the various constituencies in their multiracial multiethnic coalition  a coalition that has been vulnerable  wedge issue attacks for 50 yearsThe survey asked whether seven statements apply more  Democrats or Republicans  will take the right approach on health care understands what it is like for regular Americans will fight for people like you will reduce the power of special interests in Congress will cut taxes for the middle class will do more  ensure that people are rewarded for hard work and will help improve the economy and create jobsDemocrats held the advantage on one of the seven health care and that was  four points Republicans were ahead on every other issue Most important Republicans led Democrats  a solid 19 points on ensuring that people are rewarded for hard work and  a devastating 35 points on improving the economy and creating jobs  just what A Better Deal claims  doWhen Schumer Pelosi and other Democrats seek  make the case for a better deal they face an audience primed  disbelieve every word they sayI asked Pete Brodnitz the founder of Expedition Strategies one of the firms that conducted this survey whether he thought there was a link between Trumps emphasis on immigration Latino gangs and crime and the Democrats efforts  shift the agenda  economic policyThis has been building for months but it has become pronounced recently he wrote in an email The Trump administration hopes Democrats will react  defending immigration and look soft on gangs  aware that if they push the envelope on this issue they can get coverage for their efforts and drown out Democratic efforts  change the picBrodnitz described Trumps tactics as offering ideas that sound really outlandish but that they believe have popular support  at least with their core voters and that the Long Island speech was based on the hope that Democrats would look more concerned about criminals than about crime and its victimsTo put it mildly it has been difficult for the Democrats  recruit key white voters  consider an economic agenda in the face of concerted efforts  the Trump campaign and his administration  shift the focus  crimeI asked a prominent political scientist  a man with generally moderate views  for his reaction  Trumps comments in the Long Island speech His answer surprised me Requesting anonymity in order  speak candidly he repliedI think yeah a lot of people whites anyway think that the police are o constrained When I watch the anarchists tear up Oakland which happens pretty regularly a part of me thinks where are the 1968 Chicago police when we really need them These thugs behave the way they do in part because there are no consequences Also we see a lot of cases on TV where someone is resisting arrest the police wrestle him down and hit him a few times and then there are complaints about excessive force Heavens sakes if someone doesnt comply with an order what are the police supposed  doOne question Haidts survey asks respondents is whether they agree or disagree with the idea that a criminal should be made  suffer in the same way that his victim sufferedHaidt said progressives strongly reject it and it correlates fairly well with politics  the farther right you are the more you endorse itWhat then does Pinker make of Trumps Long Island speechIt appeals  one of our worst angels the desire for rough justice  quick and brutal revenge inflicted on a suspected wrongdoer The ultimate evolutionary rationale for revenge vendettas blood feuds mob violence summary justice lynching vigilantes deadly ethnic riots the code of the streets and other forms of rough justice is deterrence if a person anticipates getting beaten up for exploiting people hell think twice about exploiting themTrump in Pinkers view has focused on the most primitive and regressive emotions among votersSo yes Trump is wisecracking about overturning millennia of progress in taming our brutish instincts for instant retaliation and discarding the norms and institutions of justice that our better angels have crafted and perfectedPinker sees this as part of an ongoing struggleThe appeal of regressive impulses is perennial The forces of liberalism modernity cosmopolitanism the open society and Enlightenment values always have  push against our innate tribalism authoritarianism and thirst for vengeanceAnd yesat times in hisry the darker forces prevail  the two world wars the American crime wave from the 1960s  early 1990s the rise of civil war in the developing world over that same period These darker forces moreover are not just raw instincts but often rationalized in ideologiesThe connection may not seem obvious at first but Pinkers comments are directly relevant  the Democratic Partys attempt  counter Trump with liberal economic policiesNot only is their adversary a man ungoverned  rule or tradition but he is a man who has taken our impulses of authoritarianism and tribalism  quote Pinker one last time and constructed an edifice of rationalization around themThis puts the Democrats in a dangerous position The more they succeed in pushing Trump up against a wall politically speaking the more they risk the possibility that the he will inflict real damage whether it is hostile engagement abroad or increasingly aggressive attacks on democratic institutions at homeIt is ominous that Trump has already hit upon the use of force as his preferred solution when confronting domestic lawandorder issues One hates  think of what a man with his mindset can do with a nuclear arsenal and the world as his stagethe strange specter of an American presidents seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians created such a cognitive dissonance among my generation of conservatives  who had come of age under existential threat from the Soviet Union  that it was almost impossible  believeConservativeshave maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical facultiesWhat Flake recognizes and what Democrats are only coming  realize is that Trump represents a systemic assault on the legitimacy of Americas democratic processes an attack that needs  be

19Himes became a writer while incarcerated Jackson refuses  romanticize Himess life or his motivation for becoming an artist There is no moral redemption in the transformation Himes undergoes while locked away Rather Jackson posits that Himes began writing  work through the trauma of a deadly prison fire that amplified the suffering and shame he had felt since childhood He wrote short sries about criminality and queerness without a blueprint drawing on the support and encouragement of his first and only samesex partner a fellow prisoner named Prince Rico Himes also briefly concealed his

writers like Richard Wright It did not however establish Himes as a fullfledged celebrity or stabilize his life Himess second and third novels failed  garner substantial praise from critics and he followed Wright and other selfexiled black American artists  France in 1953Excepting a few brief visits  America Himes remained in Europe for the rest of his life Jacksons depiction of his life in France is riveting Himes wrote at a furious pace but struggled mightily with finances squandering fellowships signing illconceived contracts with publishers and reneging on debts He joined a vibrant artistic community in France befriending and antagonizing the literary giants of his time including Wright his idol dear friend and sometime rival and Ralph EllisonJackson establishes early in the

of artistic labor and alcoholism and he drew heavily on his experiences especially his partnerships with white women in his writing about the psychosexual dimensions of racism He led an entirely straight romantic life after prison and his relationship hisry was replete with episodes of abuse and misbehavior that sullied the affection he showed for the women he lovedDespite Himess literary output wealth and sustained praise eluded him until the final third of his career Disappointed  his American book sales and haunted  the fact that literary elites did not hold him in the same esteem as Ellison and James Baldwin Himes ok the advice of the French edir Marcel Duhamel and started writing detective novels beginning with A Rage in Harlem 1957 Seemingly overnight Himes was reborn as a

depiction of black life This is at least partially true as Himess work was eventually developed in the Ossie Davisdirected Cotn Comes  Harlem 1970 arguably the first Blaxploitation film ever producedYet Jackson disputes the notion that Himess hardboiled detective series evades or cheapens racial politics Instead Jackson argues that Himess sizzling exaggerations  amplified and telescoped Himess political concerns The gruesome collage of Harlem fashioned  Himes was devoid of love and racial justice which mirrored his shrewd cynicism about racial progress But Jackson says that spilling blood guts and tragedy on the page was not merely entertainment or catharsis but politics because it left room for optimism  fill the void left  despair and destructionMany of the details of Himess life appear in other books but Jacksons research is unimpeachable The biography is based on a kaleidoscopic mix of archival materials close readings of Himess published writing and personal letters and conversations with people who knew him Himes had a mercurial personality and led a thrilling life that might tempt a biographer  conjure a book in the spirit of its subject but Jackson avoids this pitfall The book is neatly written and accessible without cheap tricks  build suspense or sway readers opinionsAs for the thorny question of interpretation Jackson builds measured straightforward arguments about what Himes believed mostly through close readings of his published work Carefully chosen excerpts allow Jackson  comment on the techniques themes and characters most central  Himess

What started out as a counterintelligence investigation  guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed in a political scandal about what Mr Trump did what he said and what he meant  it Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the FBI direcr he fired with cascading requests for documents recordings and hearingsIts important for us in the West  understand that were facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons  do us harm said Daniel Fried a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year Whatever the domestic politics of this Comey was spon right that Russia is coming after us but not just the US but the free world in general And we need  take this seriouslyJames B Comey the former FBI direcr testified before the Senate Intelligence CommitteeMr Comeys willingness  discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart As FBI direcr he supervised counterintelligence investigations in computer breakins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House and that penetrated deep in the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Yet President Barack Obamas administration did not want  publicize those intrusions choosing  handle them diplomatically  perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort  manipulate American politicsMr Comeys special agents failed  react aggressively  evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young informationtechnology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organizations emails Only when emails from Hillary Clinns presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operationIn Ocber Mr Comey declined  sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election  not because he doubted the evidence aides later said the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem o political so close  Election Day Now many members of Mr Obamas national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlierAnd there is no evidence that the Russians have spped The NSA suspects that a group calling itself the

regard were hamhanded and could be countered with relative ease he said Today the Russians are much more sophisticated and they see things like disinformation propaganda and what we used  call active measures as part of a suite of capabilitiesIn Washingn however the issue has become partisan because Mr Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as fake news generated  Democrats  explain their defeatHe repeated that during a news conference on Friday That was an excuse  the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldnt have lost he saidA look at what we can glean from the questions James B Comey the former direcr of the FBI would not answer publicly during his testimony before Congress on ThursdayMr Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russias role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday Mr Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing  protect against future Russian interventionThere should be no fuzz on this whatsoever Mr Comey said The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle They did it with purpose They did it with sophistication They did it with overwhelming technical efforts And it was an activemeasures campaign driven from the p of that government There is no fuzz on thatHe added Thats about as unfake as you can possibly get and is very very seriousWhat we didnt talk enough about was the purpose we were there about Russias involvement and Russias intent how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue  keep trying and hitting on us  change how we do business in America how we elect our officials the confidence we have in our government Senar Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia said Friday on Morning Joe on MSNBCSimilar warnings have been issued  others in the intelligence community led  James R Clapper Jr who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as direcr of national intelligence I dont think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing he said recentlyBut few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams  they started a scandal that has consumed the American political processThey can win two ways Senar Sheldon Whitehouse a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee said

dysfunctional governments oppressive rulers shoestring democracies ethnic warfare and mass violence and have found themselves rubbing elbows and bumpers in a wealthy Texas city where potholes traffic mosquies and pension reform are some of the biggest concerns They are just as opinionated about America in the Trump era as any talkshow talking head but their analyses like their accents are their ownFor some Housnians whose origins are in countries far away what they see in American politics baffles and disturbs them as elements of the world they left behind seem  echo back  them in the news from Washingn as Mr Alatassi discovered watching the cabinet meeting And yet others reacted optimistically and emphasized their belief that the current political turmoil in this country did not compare  the failures and problems of the countries they fledSteve Le was born in South Vietnam and was 7 years old when he boarded a ship the day before the fall of Saigon in 1975 with his family and

process looks dirty  some people in the end it all comes out clean We continue  be the longeststanding constitutional nation in the entire hisry of Earth and it is because our forefathers designed that constitution so uniquely in balancing out the powersThe presidents cabinet meeting bothered Yohannes Tesfagibir oMr Tesfagibir 36 came  the United States eight years ago from his native country

been held and young people are forced  work for extended periods in a national service program Last year a United Nations commission of inquiry said the national service program amounted  a form of slavery and accused the leaders of Eritrea of other crimes against humanity in a report denounced  government officialsThe scene in Washingn reminded him of a scene in Eritrea Its reminiscent of the oneman show everyone working for the president instead of working for the country Mr Tesfagibir said of the Trump cabinet session It was very suspiciousStill although Mr Tesfagibir said he was worried about the direction of the country and called Mr Trump a bully he said he never loses perspectiveThe reason Im talking  you now is because Im free he saidImmigrants and refugees differed on drawing parallels between the political turmoil in America with the turmoil of their home countriesThe whole talk from Trump about Im going  solve their problems somebody else is the cause of the problems and if youre not with me then youre not patriotic  thats the Middle East Mr Alatassi saidBut M J Khan a PakistaniAmerican businessman Republican and former councilman who became the first MuslimAmerican

live as you wish made any comparison mootWe used  get something called a ration card Mr Khan said of growing up in Pakistan Food was rationed off so every family would get a ration card based on how many people you have in the family and you can only get that much food Theres no freedom of any kind You cannot go and talk against any person in authority at all Over here I can go  the city council next Tuesday and blast out the mayorMr Khan 67 the president of the Islamic Society of Greater Housn said he is as outraged as anyone else on Capil Hill over Russian meddling in the 2016 electionIt makes me angry as an American Mr Khan said The beauty of America was and still is fair and impartial elections Ive lived in a society where that was not the case In spite of all the challenges we have this is still  far the best system the best society the best country you name it Maybe because we have had it so good we are spoiled and we expect betterThe political pulse of Housns global village is if nothing else intricately nuanced With Russia dominating the headlines and drawing the ire of many Americans the executive direcr of Housns Russian Cultural Center had a clear point  make She was appalled at the unrestrained hostility ward Mr Trump on display in popular culture and in the news mediaI spent 27 years here and I never hear anything in the media so antipresidential never ever in my life Ms Grinblat said If this is OK  make a play in a New York park how they killed the president and everybody laughed and think this is funny and if this is OK  publish information like that some

WASHINGTON  For decades James B Comey cultivated an image of purity as a lawman who sod above politics and politiciansThen came the book urWith the release of his memoir this week and a set of highprofile media interviews  publicize it Mr Comey  whose firing  President Trump made him a hero  the presidents critics  has veered on risky terrain shedding the trappings of a highminded referee and looking instead like a combatant in the countrys partisan battlesMr Comeys description of the president as an unethical liar morally unfit for office his call for voters  decide Mr Trumps fate at the ballot box in 2020 and even his observations about Mr Trumps appearance  his orange skin his olong ties his hands  are stark departures from the lawenforcement mission of his old agency the Federal Bureau of InvestigationThe personal potshots in particular have surprised some former colleagues who thought of Mr Comey as relatively sober and serious Observers on both the left and right  including many who count themselves as fierce critics of Mr Trumps  say that in embarking on his star turn Mr Comey may be undercutting his own indictment of the presidents character and conductThe real impact of having the former head of the FBI calling the president unfit is dependent on the justthefacts professional image of the FBI said Michael Steel a Republican strategist who has been critical of Mr Trump To the extent that the former direcr appears petty and anything less than highminded it diminishes the impact of his critiqueIn a time when almost every public debate is defined  people lining up with their respective tribes Mr Steel added hes managed  alienate bothMr Comey in remarks promoting the book says he is trying  rouse the country  see Mr Trump through the lens of ethical leadership arguing that the president does not reflect the values of Democrats Republicans or independents Asked on ABC if Mr Trump should be impeached Mr Comey said he hoped it would not happen because voters were duty bound  go  the voting booth and vote their valuesMr Comey has cast himself as a truthteller before sometimes  the irritation of colleagues or superiors He threatened  quit his job at the Justice Department in the George W Bush administration rather than sign off on a domestic surveillance program the White House demanded and he refused Mr Trumps entreaties  back off of the investigation of Michael T Flynn his former national security adviser Mr Trump fired Mr Comey a few months later calling him a grandstander and citing the FBIs investigation in his administrations ties  RussiaAfter he was fired he finally became the martyr he always held himself out  be said Matthew A Miller who served as a p Justice Department official under President Obama when Mr Comey led the FBI By doing a ur like this where you kind of get down in the gutter the way he has you sacrifice your claim on being a martyrEven before the release of his book A Higher Loyalty the White House working in concert with the Republican National Committee began an allout campaign  besmirch Lyin Comey  the name of a website the party created  make the case  as dishonest selfserving and driven  partisanship But with his oneliners and cutting asides about the president Mr Comey only appeared  play in the hands of allies of Mr Trump who are eager  paint the former FBI direcr as just another figure working for the presidents defeatAnd Mr Comey has drawn bipartisan criticism with his latest efforts  explain  and  some degree recast  his muchcriticized handling of the investigation in Hillary Clinns use of a private email server Mark Mellman a longtime Democratic pollster said Mr Comeys standing had been undermined  the onetwo punch of liberal attacks over his role in the 2016 election and the more recent assault led  Mr Trump and his Republican alliesTrump has tried  define him as a bad operar and the problem for Comey is that you can quote a lot of Democrats saying the same Mr Mellman saidAt this point it seems unlikely that Mr Comeys book or his performance in interviews  promote it will sway public opinion in a country that is already intensely polarized along partisan lines Mr Trumps approval ratings have been similar for months and the roughly 40 percent of Americans who support him have proven remarkably unshakable while the 56 percent who disapprove will probably not change their views on Mr Comeys accountWhile Mr Comey is sure  captivate the public for a few days with his biting descriptions of the president and dramatic of interactions with him the combination of the supercharged news cycle and the looming  and far more consequential  investigation  Robert S Mueller III the special counsel probing Russias meddling in the 2016 election is sure  eventually overshadow his memoirIt keeps the sry of coverups and corruption on the public radar while Mueller is doing his investigation but Comey is just a pit sp along the way of that said Stephanie Cutter a veteran Democratic strategist Much  Comeys chagrin his moment has passed Theres nothing in this book we dont already know He just adds one more hole  a ship thats already sinkingMr Comey plainly considers himself  be a figure who is above the political fray driven and guided solely  facts His friends and advisers say he wants the book  stir a conversation about the value of honestyTelling the truth should not be seen as a political act said Keith Urbahn Mr Comeys book agent It should just be the truthYet there is a twist While he professes  be uneasy with the countrys growing polarization and appears  disdain partisanship Mr Comey has in effect weaponized himself against a Republican president  calling for him  be voted out of office Mr Comey may not want  be used as anybodys political battering ram as one associate put it but he recognizes that is precisely how his book will be deployedFriends say Mr Comey expected his memoir would be criticized because of how it would inevitably be construed either as airbrushing hisry and not being honest about Mr Trumps transgressions or as a selfserving and scoresettling account with the man who ended his career in law enforcementStill Mr Comeys former colleagues rejected any notion that he has transformed himself in a political acr or hurt his reputationJim Comey is as upright honest and decent a person and public servant as I have ever met said Jack ldsmith who served with him in the Bush Justice DepartmentAs for his willingness  engage in Trumpian insults invoking the size of the presidents hands his allies argue that he is simply attempting  paint vivid scenes and does the same with the other presidents he servedMr Miller however said Mr Comey tends  be at his best when hes coloring inside the lines and following the rules as prosecurs are trained  doWhat you see in the book is not just a factual recitation but also a lot of spin on the ball he saidCollapse,politics

presidential contest Americas selfimage as a middleclass nation is so deeply ingrained in the countrys politics that we dont often sp  think what precisely that means whether it defines a concrete socioeconomic identity  a country where most people are neither very rich nor very poor  or an aspiration the notion that if you work hard and play  the rules as Clinn put it the first time she ran for president youre entitled  at least a modest prosperity Everyday Americans was an attempt  acknowledge that the gap between these two ideas has widened  the point that ignoring it seems out of uch Yet in its reversal the campaign inadvertently revealed just how ill equipped American politics is for a postmiddleclass nation  how deeply the way the country speaks of itself is tied up with these aspirations even as more and more of its citizens come  see them as out of reachAs the first election results and exit polls came in Trumps voters seemed  be mostly highschooleducated white men mostly making less than 50000 a year Perhaps more surprising this description also fits with some tailoring the voters who have propelled the candidacy of Bernie Sanders In mostly white New Hampshire Sanders beat Clinn among voters making less than 50000 a year  a staggering 33 percentage points  twice as big as his margin with voters who made more than that  and  36 percentage points among voters without college degrees In Michigan whose suburban voters are one of the mostwatched barometers in American politics the margins were narrower but still notable Sanders won white voters without a college degree  15 percentage points and voters making less than 50000  3 percentage pointsThese insurgent candidates are capturing one of the two demographic groups that converged in the great middleclass experiment that began seven decades ago When people spoke of the middle class in the years immediately after World War II they were typically talking about the group identified  the sociologist CWright Mills in his 1951 book White Collar the usually collegeeducated deskbound employees of a newly technocratic corporate economy It was only a few years later that the definition was generally

unofficial restrictions making it difficult for nonwhites  own property in them and few more so than Detroits The white exDemocrats whom Greenbergs team interviewed he later wrote expressed a profound distaste for black Americans a sentiment that pervaded almost everything they thought about government and politics Blacks constituted the explanation for their vulnerability and for almost everything that had gone wrong in their lives not being black was what constituted being middle classStill Greenberg noted Macomb voters had not defected en masse from the Democratic Party until after years of worsening economic circumstances  and until they perceived the Democrats as not only having taken up the banner of the urban poor and nonwhites but also having abandoned the white middle class These voters wondered why they werent the central drama of the Democratic Party Greenberg wrote Greenberg suggested that Democrats offer a kind of grand bargain  the white middleclass voters he called Reagan Democrats The Democrats would reinstate the middle class as the gravitational center of the partys economic policy if those voters accepted an expanded definition of who was included in the middle classCharles Homans is the politics edir for the magazine,politics
Robert B Silvers a founder of The New York Review of Books which under his edirship became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States a showcase for extended thoughtful essays on literature and politics  eminent writers died on Monday at his home in Manhattan He was 87Rea S Hederman the publisher of The Review confirmed the deathThe New York Review founded in 1963 was born with a mission   raise the standards of book reviewing and literary discussion in the United States and nurture a hybrid form of politicocultural essay Mr Silvers brought  its pages a selfeffacing almost priestly sense of devotion that ultimately made him indistinguishable from the publication he edited and it from himI put my name on the paper and the rest I dont care  be known he ld Philip Nobile the author of Intellectual Skywriting Literary Politics and The New York Review of Books 1974 In a 2008 interview for the online program Thoughtcast Mr Silvers said The edir is a middleman The one thing he should avoid is taking credit Its the writer that countsHis myriad enthusiasms found their way in a publication that was edited for an audience of one When asked  describe readers he once said I really dont know o much about themHe was happiest surrounded  stacks of manuscripts  the writers he pursued with flattery and guile in one typical instance he drafted Jonathan Miller  write about John Updikes novel The Centaur for the first issue of The Review  waylaying him after a performance of Beyond the Fringe on Broadway He would inundate them with newspaper clippings afterthoughts helpful notes and suggestions for further reading as they iled over their assignmentsIt was routine for him  hunt down contriburs on their vacations The Christmasmorning phone call was not unknownMost writers regarded him with admiration verging on aweHe was one of those rare edirs who is also ones ideal reader Ian Buruma a marquee writer for The Review since 1985 said in a phone interview for this obituary in 2011 He was not only sympathetic but you knew that he would get it and not try  rewrite because he really wanted  be a writer He was unusual in being interested in so many things in a profound way  a polymath who knew a tremendous amount about many subjectsRobert Benjamin Silvers was born on Dec 31 1929 in Mineola NY a village on Long Island His father James was a businessman who left Manhattan  live the rural life His mother the former Rose Roden was the music critic for the The New York Globe long since disappeared A precocious student he left high school in Rockville Centre at 15 and enrolled in the University of Chicago He pursued an accelerated twoyear program earning a bachelors degree in 1947Mr Silvers spent three semesters studying law without enthusiasm at Yale In 1950 he entered the Army and was assigned  the intelligence library of NATO military headquarters in Paris He studied at the Sorbonne and Sciences PoAfter completing his military service he remained in Paris living on a houseboat on the Seine with the future bandleader Peter Duchin He patched gether a living as a representative of the publisher Noonday Press and an edir of a quarterly magazine published  the World Assembly of Youth the magazine probably unknown  him was financed  the CIAAn introduction  George Plimpn led  a post as managing edir of the newly created Paris Review a journal in some disarray and badly in need of an edirial guiding hand It seemed  me quite a natural thing Mr Silvers ld The Guardian of his decision  take up editing as a vocation It was something I could do without even making a choiceInterviewed  Mr Nobile for his book Mr Plimpn said of Mr Silvers He was rather shy but formidable and a strong voice amidst all this sturm und drang He made The Paris Review what it wasJohn Fischer the edir of Harpers hired Mr Silvers at the recommendation of Mr Plimpns father Francis a corporate lawyer  oversee literary articles and book reviews at the magazine in 1958For that issue he commissioned Ms Hardwick a literary critic  write an extended essay on the state of book reviewing in the United States She dismissed the reviewing in American newspapers and magazines as tepid perfuncry shallow and in a word noncritical Her main target was The New York Times Book ReviewThree years later a typographers strike shut down nine major newspapers in New YorkThe timing was perfectJason Epstein an edir at Random House and his wife Ms Epstein a freelance edir had proposed the idea of a new publication in discussions with Ms Hardwick and her husband the poet Robert Lowell They had in mind a literary review on the model of The Times Literary Supplement in London or the literary section of the British magazine The New Statesman under V S Pritchett a forum for writers  discuss ideas books ideas and politics at length provocativelyWhen the newspaper strike deprived book publishers of their main advertising outlets the pipe dream ok on solid form and Mr Epstein immediately called Mr Silvers who had been thinking along similar lines  engage him as an edirGathering in the offices of Harpers at night Mr Silvers and his coconspirars worked their way through stacks of review books and compiled a list of ideal reviewersWhen a trial issue of The Review was published in Feb 1 1963 many of those names were in its pages writing free of charge Mr Kazin Ms McCarthy Mr Miller Norman Mailer Dwight Macdonald Irving Howe re Vidal Susan Sontag William Styron The print run of 100000 sold outIn an asnishingly short time The Review had not only turned a profit but also established itself as a rival  two other magazines Partisan Review and Commentary an American counterpart founded in 1945 But unlike them it made its starting point the world of books and publishingMr Silvers liked essays that both made an argument and settled it We like important questions  be dealt with  experts with strong views he ld Time magazine in 1967He also liked  let writers roam figuratively and literally freed from the constraints imposed  most American publicationsWhat we saw was that the book review is a form that is capable of being used  address nearly any kind of issue and any kind of question because theres always a book Mr Silvers said in an interview at the University of California Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism in 1999 Book reviewing can be a way of bringing critical perspectives  bear on the most intense political issuesOver the years The Review became famous for wideranging essays that often dealt only glancingly with the multiple book titles sometimes as many as a dozen nominally under considerationMr Silvers liked  match writers with unexpected subjects After noticing that Mr Mailer had left Ms McCarthy out of the discussion when he assessed the talent in the room in s for Myself he assigned Mr Mailer  review Ms McCarthys novel The Group Applying the same logic  political writing he sent Ms McCarthy  Hanoi Vietnam and a reluctant V S Naipaul  the 1984 Republican National Convention in DallasWhen Joan Didion and her husband John Gregory Dunne traveled  El Salvador in 1982 Mr Silvers coaxed a series of long dispatches from her on the difficult situation of a country in the grip of a rightwing dictarship It later became a bestselling book SalvadorThe editing process was a characteristic performance  Mr SilversHow Bob edited Salvador was  constantly nudging me ward updates on the situation and  pointing out weaker material Ms Didion ld The Paris Review in 2006 When I gave him the text for example it had a very weak ending which was about meeting an American evangelical student on the flight home In other words it was the travel piece carried  its logical and not very interesting conclusionThe way Bob led me away from this was  suggest not that I cut it its still there but that I follow it  and so ground it  with a return  the political situationWith Ms Epstein as his coedir and A Whitney Ellsworth as publisher Mr Silvers kept The Review in the thick of literary and political debate in the 1960s He published searching critiques of American policy in Southeast Asia throughout the 1960s featuring the work of I F Sne and Noam Chomsky prominentlyThe journal flirted with the New Left and became a word for radical chic The issue of Aug 24 1967 epimized its political stance The leftwing journalist Andrew Kopkind wrote a scathing review of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jrs book Where Do We  From Here Chaos or Community dismissing its author as hopelessly out of uch and accommodationist while Tom Hayden contributed an analysis of the race riots in Newark that was accompanied  a diagram on how  make a Molov cocktailWith the windup of the Vietnam War Mr Silvers opened up the pages of The Review  a host of British writers like Frank Kermode A Alvarez Isaiah Berlin AJP Taylor and Chrispher Ricks who lent the magazine a more sedate literary ne which made it seem less a successor  the brawling political journals that dominated New York intellectual life in the 1930s and 1940s than  majestic Vicrian flagships like The Edinburgh ReviewPolitics never faded entirely from the picture From the outset Mr Silvers made human rights and the need  check excessive state power his preoccupations rising at times  the level of a crusade Petitions and essays on behalf of political prisoners and victims of human rights violations were a constant featureMr Silvers despite the magicians aura and the seemingly sacred status of The Review came in for his share of criticism He seemed  have little interest in younger writers and particularly in the 1970s The Review seemed  suffer from an advanced case of AnglophiliaDespite its selfimage as an arena of intellectual combat it could be staid even boring The same writers showed up in issue after issue and for a time The Review was jokingly called The New York Review of Each Others Books Mr Silvers could blow hot and cold on his writers courting them assiduously then dropping them without explanation or apologyAfter the election of President George W Bush and the advent of a more interventionist American foreign policy culminating in the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq Mr Silvers recast The Review as a leading critical voice Recapturing its militant spirit of the 1960s he filled its pages with long scathing critiques of the governments diplomacy its conduct of the wars and its record on civil libertiesFor Mr Silvers The Review had never changed only the circumstances of the world around it Its personality and its mission had remained constant since the days of the newspaper strikeDaniel E Slotnik contributed reportingCollapse,politics

NonfictionThe greatest threat  Western liberal democracies in the future is more likely  come from extreme inequality than from Islamic extremism This is because inequality erodes two foundation snes of modern society  openness  new ideas and opportunities and a conviction that all citizens are morally equalFor the first three decades after World War II openness and equality constituted a virtuous circle Openness generated unprecedented levels of prosperity That prosperity allowed America and the citizens of other modern nations  invest in excellent schools and universities basic research modern infrastructure and social insurance These investments in turn made it easier for people  adapt  change and fostered ever greater equalities of income and opportunity The result was a high level of trust in the fairness of the political and economic systemBut  the 1980s the virtuous circle had spped working Economic and technological dynamism was upending jobs convulsing communities and splintering families At the same time inequalities of earnings wealth and job security were widening After the financial crisis of 2008 many Americans along with the citizens of other nations affected  the crisis began  doubt the fairness of the system Some came  feel neglected disadvantaged powerless or otherwise left behind Within the decade they became easy fodder for demagogues who rejected openness and blamed others  immigrants foreign manufacturers the news media racial or ethnic or religious minorities  for what had happened  themEnter Donald Trump who promised  make America great again  erecting walls slowing immigration withdrawing from freetrade agreements cutting science budgets attacking the free press and retreating from security alliances the United States has maintained since 1945 Meanwhile Britain has pulled out of Europe Marine Le Pen leader of Frances National Front has been mounting a challenge  the French establishment Hungarys Vikr Orban and others of his ilk are emulating closedsociety dictarships The result is likely  be less prosperity and widening inequality The old virtuous circle is in danger of becoming a new vicious cycleTwo important new books offer useful and complementary explanations for what has occurred and  implication what must be done In The Fate of the West Bill Emmott argues that the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath resulted from a devastating blend of complacency negligence and corruption in the years leading up  it The banks that created the calamity got bailed out and no p executive went  jail but millions of people lost their jobs savings and homes Nearly a decade later many citizens in the United States Britain France Italy and elsewhere still feel trapped in deadend jobs or dont have jobs at all The result has been a profound loss of confidence in the systemEmmott who was edir in chief of The Economist from 1993  2006 faults economic and political elites who chose  advance themselves at the expense of the larger society He points  a paradox deep within modern capitalism The same financial incentives that spur innovation and investment can also lead the captains of industry and finance  manipulate the rules of the game for their own benefit and there harm those without power These moneyed elites are the true sources of the sense of inequality that is currently threatening the openness that has enabled us in the West  flourish he writes They are the explanation for Trump for Brexit for Le PenEmmott argues that the financial interests of banks and big companies have disrted and disarmed public policy Both of Americas political parties are culpable Most norious in the US at least was the successful lobing in 1998  Wall Street of the treasury secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy Larry Summers  block regulation of the trading of complex derivatives products which had been proposed  the then head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Brooksley Born Emmott also criticizes big companies like ogle which have the lobing and financial heft  get whatever they want in Washingn Campaign finance scandals have likewise revealed the political influence of money in Germany Japan France Britain and elsewhereThe greatest source of unfairness stemming from the 2008 crash according  Emmott was the political and civic inequality it revealed He believes that  preserve an open society we really do need as Trump has said  drain the swamp Getting big money out of politics would enable us for example  combat the rigidities and high prices of monopolies through strong antitrust enforcement and  remove the exorbitant privileges that allow big banks  make profits at the expense of the rest of society But  do this we will need a new or at least resred vision of equality based not on redistribution or socialism but on equality of voice and rights so citizens can demand such reformsEmmott sees political and civic equality as the means  an open society But why shouldnt such equality be an end in itself In One Anothers Equals The Basis of Human Equality Jeremy Waldron a professor of philosophy at New York University School of Law argues that Western thought has been rooted in the moral imperative that people be treated and respected as equals whatever disparities may exist between them in wealth or talent Waldron sees moral equality between human beings as whats left over when merit is set aside People deserve equal concern and respect because they are humans Differences in wealth and power are consistent with this imperative if those differences serve the interests of all Thus the answer  whose good is  be promoted in our social arrangements is  everyones goodWaldron warns that wide inequalities of income and wealth can erode this moral imperative because they make it harder  make the mental leap it requires The poor may come  seem so different from the privileged and prosperous that the welloff cannot understand a moral principle that assigns equal value  the living of a human life as such We might become so accusmed  economic inequality so inured  the spectacle of it despite its being unjustified that we cease  recognize those who are deprived as nevertheless our equals he writes clearly alluding  modern Western society It may even be morally embarrassing for us  recognize them as such he argues since we would then have  acknowledge the injustice Better perhaps  turn away or  try what it feels like  deny or suppress the proposition that poor people o are entitled  equal concernWaldron urges the same sort of political equality as does Emmott but he gets there from the opposite direction For him the purpose of political equality is not  preserve an open society It is  honor basic human equality It is because we are one anothers equals that we ought  have concern about high levels of economic inequality he writesViewed from either Emmotts or Waldrons point of departure  the necessity of preserving an open society or of respecting the moral equality of human beings  the surge ward widening inequality is endangering the West The culprit is not economic inequality per se It is the political inequality that economic inequality can spawn How will the vicious cycle we are now experiencing come  an end These two insightful books suggest that if we dont recommit ourselves  political equality we will become ever more closed authoritarian societies Economic elites should understand this As Emmott notes without openness the West cannot thrive But without equality the West cannot lastRobert B

As the forces of reaction outpace movements predicated on the ideal of progress and as traditional norms of political competition are ssed aside its clear that the internet and social media have succeeded in doing what many feared and some hoped they would They have disrupted and destroyed institutional constraints on what can be said when and where it can be said and who can say itEven though in one sense President Trumps vicry in 2016 fulfilled conventional expectations  because it prevented a third straight Democratic term in the White House  it also revealed that the internet and its offspring have overridden the traditional American political system of alternating leftright advantage They are contributing  perhaps irreversibly   the decay of traditional moral and ethical constraints in American politicsSuch a regime in his view would keep the trappings of democracy including seemingly free elections while leaders would control the election process the media and the scope of permissible debate What you get is a country that is de fac less freea great thing for getting additional layers of transparency It was true for Donald Trump as it was for Bernie Sanders the internet ended smokefilled back rooms dealcutting moved from back room  a true campaign with a more general population Maybe an unwashed population but thats the beauty of American politics with 350 million peopleodstein noted however a horrible development on the internet last yearIn this cycle you saw hate speech retweeted and echoed  partisan hacks the Jewish star used in neoNazi posts There is no governing body so I think its going  get worse more people jumping in the gutterAccording  Persily the Trump campaign was tally unprecedented in its breaking of established norms of politics He argues thatthis type of campaign is only successful in a context in which certain established institutions  particularly the mainstream media and political party organizations  have lost most of their power both in the United States and around the worldThe Trump campaign is the most recent beneficiary of the collapse of oncedominant organizationsThe void these eroding institutions have left was filled  an unmediated populist nationalism tailormade for the internet age We see it in the rise of the Five Star Movement in Italy and the Pirate Party in Iceland We see it in the successful use of social media in the Brexit referendum in which supporters were seven times more numerous on Twitter and five times more active on Instagram And we see it in the pervasive fears of government leaders throughout Europe who worried well before the American election that Russian propaganda and other internet tactics might sway their elecratesThe influence of the internet is the latest manifestation of the weakening of the two major American political parties over the past century with the Civil Service undermining patronage the rise of mass media altering communication campaign finance law empowering donors independent of the parties and the ascendance of direct primaries gutting the power of party bosses  pick nomineesNeither party appeared  have a mechanism of internal correction Neither could muster the wise elders  steer a more conventional course Neither could use its congressional leadership  regain control of the party through its powers of governance Neither could lay claim  financial resources that would compel a measure of candidate loyalty Neither could even exert influence though party endorsementsThe resultThe parties proved hollow vehicles that offered little organizational resistance  capture  outsiders And what was captured appeared little more than a brand certainly not the vibrant organizations that are heralded as the indispensable glue of democratic politicsIssacharoff was even more concerned about the future of democratic politics in a talk Anxieties of Democracy that he gave in February at the University of Texas law schoolWe are witnessing a period of deep challenge  the core claims of democracy  be the superior form of political organization of civilized peoples he ld his audienceThe current moment of democratic uncertainty draws from four central institutional challenges each one a compromise of how democracy was consolidated over the past few centuries First the accelerated decline of political parties and other institutional forms of engagement second the weakness of the legislative branches third the loss of a sense of social cohesion and fourth the decline in democratic state competenceIn a phone interview Issacharoff cited the emergence of internetbased methods of communication as a major contributing facr in the deterioration of political partiesTechnology has overtaken one of the basic functions you needed political parties for in the past communication with voters he said Social media has changed all of that candidates now have direct access through email blogs and Twitter along with Facebook Instagram Snapchat and other platformsTeams of hackers operating with varying levels of resources and at various distances from the central chain of command had a lot of license  poke and prod and see what they could come up with Some of these people found it easier  do certain kinds of things  like break in Podestas emails  than they had expected Having obtained a windfall they were then given license  push it even furtherThe question now is who benefits more from the digital revolution and the ubiquity of social media the left or the rightIt seems  me this is not a question about ideological placement but more about organizational or movement strategy As long as I am in opposition the payoff is higher in investing in digital infrastructure and there channeling the activities and enthusiasm of my supporters than when in power So I would expect a reemergence of political activity for example in the form of alternative news sources on the liberal side in the coming yearsBy qualitatively expanding the pool of participants social media may thus be substantially contributing  some of the vivid examples of political disruption that we have witnessed over the past few years across and beyond the Western world from the spread of protest movements  the sudden rise of new parties such as the Five Star Movement in Italy and Podemos in Spain from the ascent of populist leaders all across Europe  elecral upheavals such as the Brexit referendum and the surge of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump in the United States 2016 Presidential electionsThe internet is the first medium in hisry that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time Whereas the phone gave us the oneone pattern and television radio magazines books gave us the onemany pattern the internet gives us the manymany patternShirky continuesThe second big change is that as all media gets digitized the internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media meaning that phone calls migrate  the internet magazines migrate  the internet movies migrate  the internet And that means that every medium is right next door  every other medium Put another way media is increasingly less just a source of information and it is increasingly more a site of coordination because groups that see or hear or watch or listen  something can now gather around and talk  each other as wellAnd the third big change according  Shirky is that members of the former audiencecan now also be producers and not consumers Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well because the same equipment  phones computers  let you consume and produce Its as if when you bought a book they threw in the printing press for free its like you had a phone that could turn in a radio if you pressed the right butnsThere is good reason  think that the disruptive forces at work in the United States  as they expand the universe of the politically engaged and open the debate  millions who previously paid little or no attention  may do more  damage the left than strengthen it In other words just as the use of negative campaign ads and campaign finance loopholes  channel suspect contributions eventually became routine so o will be the use of social media  confuse and mislead the elecrateOf course this problem goes much deeper than the internet Sam Greene of Kings College London put it this way in an emailOur politics are vulnerable  nefarious influences  whether of the Kremlin variety or the Breitbart variety  not because our information landscape is open and fluid but because voters perceptions have become untethered from reality For reasons that are both complex and debatable very many voters have spped seeing government as a ol for the production of the common good and have instead turned  politicians and others who at least make them feel good Thus the news we consume has become as much about emotion and identity as about facts Thats where the vulnerability comes in and its roots are in our politics  not in the internetCollapse,politics
MEDIA Pa  As Ralph Neary waited for a hot dog outside the Delaware County courthouse here on Wednesday he chewed over the big surprise out of Washingn President Trumps firing of the FBI direcr James B ComeyMr Neary a 61yearold county maintenance man had voted for Mr Trump and liked his vision for America But now his mind raced back  his youth and  the dark days of Richard M Nixon Tricky Dick Mr

company said of the dismissal If I was Trump I would have fired him on my first dayI was in the military Mr Deorio added pointing  Mrs Clinns handling of classified information as the real outrage If I had done the same thing Id have been in LeavenworthBut Mr Neary among others who had voted for Mr Trump echoed the criticism of congressional Democrats in saying that the firing suggested an effort

FeatureRecruits at Parris Island have been subjected  severe hazing far beyond that experienced in other US military boot camps Is this really the only way  create a warriorSupported SilenceRaheel she said The phone was dead The call lasted less than five seconds In her darkened living room in Taylor Mich a suburb of Detroit Ghazala worried The previous morning Raheel a 20yearold Marine Corps recruit left for boot camp on Parris Island SC He had promised  call his parents when he arrived and Ghazala and her husband Masood had been waiting  the phone But the call when it came was strange with an almost deafening noise in the background Ghazala couldnt be sure it was even him In the morning she phoned Raheels recruiter No one knows my sons voice better than me she said That didnt sound like my sonThe Siddiquis who emigrated from Pakistan in the 1990s hadnt wanted their precious oldest child and only boy  join the Marines Slender and unathletic Raheel had always seemed most content designing video games on his computer He graduated ninth in the class of 2014 from Taylors Harry S Truman High School a valedicrian with his pick of colleges including a full academic scholarship  Michigan State After months of deliberation he decided on the University of Michigans Dearborn campus where he enrolled in September 2014 lured  its new program in robotics engineering But the following July after his freshman year Raheel drastically changed course announcing  his family that he had decided  leave college and enlist in the MarinesGhazala didnt understand Youre smart youre intelligent  why she pleaded with him Raheel tried  placate her It was a golden opportunity he ld his parents After three years in the Marine Corps I can do anythingThat call was the last time she heard her sons voiceRaheel was raised in public housing and spent his high school years intent on escaping his shab homewn He always wanted challenges says Jerry Abraham a former guidance counselor at Truman High whom Raheel frequently enlisted  help him find the hardest classes In pursuit of a perfect GPA Raheel had virtually no social life though he had a nave optimism unusual for a teenager He saw the world as nothing but a wonderful place says Karey Lee Raheels supervisor at a near  Depot where he worked part time on the cusmerservice desk I dont think he knew that hatefulness existed  be honestMilitary recruiters were fixtures at Truman High The Marines the most selective of the armed services came  campus twice a week They targeted the kids that were more collegeoriented and capable of being successful says Abraham whose office was in the same building as the schools ROTC program They were also quick  reject students who failed  meet their standards which include scores in the p third on the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery Asvab test and no hisry of serious drug use crime or tatos that the Marines consider undesirable Like many of his classmates Raheel ok the Asvab and scored high With his talents drive and rigid focus he would very likely have struck recruiters as the golden goose as one former Marine put itThe University of MichiganDearborn was the most prestigious school  which Raheel applied and in April 2014 he was accepted and given a 2000 scholarship It was not the full academic scholarship he was offered  Michigan State but with the hefty financial aid he would receive it was technically a full free ride Raheel announced on Facebook The assistance however came with strings Should his grades dip below a C average he wouldnt receive any more money until they went back upRaheel enrolled in Michigans honors program a special track requiring students  maintain a 32 GPA He assumed it would be easy Lee his boss at  Depot estimated that Raheel probably worked about 20 hours a week his freshman year though it never occurred  her  ask why he needed  work so many hours if school was paid for He never talked about what he did with the money she says I assumed he was doing well at school because I mean he was a geniusAfter high school Raheel had ld his mother she should sp working odd jobs and let him contribute  the familys income Massood didnt make much at an auparts facry and Raheel was concerned about how the family would pay for his 16yearold sister  attend college Lets face it he confided  a friend shes not going  get a full scholarship and my parents cant afford  send her so I have  make sure she goesIt was a lot for an 18yearold His grades began  suffer By December Raheel was getting Cs Worried that he might fail chemistry he texted his friend Nathan Pykor also a student at the Dearborn campus I just feel o STRESSED over all of my classes because I havent dedicated enough timeYoure fine Pykor who had known Raheel since high school replied You know that its nearly impossible  get a 40 in collegeIm not fine Raheel texted backHis solution he ld Pykor was  withdraw from his classes and start fresh in the spring which he did finishing the semester with three As and a B But as Pykor ld me withdrawing from his classes very likely meant Raheel would owe the University of Michigan the money it had given him  attend classes in the fall It also could have jeopardized his aid package for the following yearOn June 16 2015 Raheel posted on Facebook for the first time in a while Im thinking about joining the military Maybe the Marines Just three weeks later on July 8 he signed his enlistment papers and entered the Marines Delayed Entry Program which lasting anywhere between a month and a year is designed  stagger the number of recruits the corps can train at any one time Its also intended  indoctrinate poolees as they are called in the culture of the Marines The DEP is all about selling the KoolAid says a lance corporal who also enlisted in the Marines in 2015 after his freshman year I decided I didnt like college enough  justify all that debt he ld me You meet every Saturday and theyll tell you sries do little workouts he says tell you some lies Like  Yeah Im always in my room playing Xbox Theres all this time  party   anything that will appeal  college kidsRaheel spent close  eight months in the DEP under the tutelage of his recruiter who the Siddiquis said ld them that Raheel was his most motivated poolee Ghazala marveled at the changes in her son who now woke each day at 4 am  spend hours at the gym Any doubts his mother had about his education were assuaged  Raheels own assurances He said he had been ld that he could continue his education while serving and that having chosen a technical specialty working on Marine aircraft he might not even have  fight unless he wanted  In fact Marines I spoke  said it was nearly impossible  pursue an education during their first enlistment once deployed every Marine has  be prepared  fight if suddenly under attack At Raheels urging Ghazala visited the recruiting office in Taylor where she says that recruiters assured her that Raheels safety wouldnt be an issueI feel like theyre really good at lying says the lance corporal who was sold on the corps  recruiting videos that presented the Marines as badasses on humanitarian missions  save refugees or deliver food and water Raheel ld his parents that enlisting in the Marines would put him on the fast track  join the FBI which  their tal surprise had become his lifes dream A few weeks before he left for boot camp Raheel spped  Truman  tell some of his old teachers about his plans Abraham pressed him on his decision but Raheels mind was made upBe careful Raheels friend Hussein Chehab who worked with him at  Depot says he ld him before he left Just    watch yourself You dont know what kinds of people are down there You dont know how other people thinkHisry or what Marines call knowledge lives on Parris Island Everything about the place is an elegy  the corps from the statue of Marines lifting the flag on Iwo Jima  the street names each one its own small lesson Boulevard de France Cuba Street Wake Boulevard Saigon Drive Inside the Recruit Chapel a series of stainedglass windows depicts chapters of Marine heroism and sacrifice In one a plaon of Marines rests in the hand of d In another a ragtag band of soldiers and sailors stands before the gates of heaven guarded  sic crisply dressed MarinesThe Marines are Americas smallest conventional military force with just 184000 activeduty troops They are also the militarys most insular warriors  with the possible exception of Navy SEALs  whose tight bond or esprit de corps grows out of the codes traditions and reverence for suffering that Marines believe set them apart from civilians and all other military branchesCentral  this identity is the uniquely miserable experience of boot camp where since World War II as the hisrian Aaron OConnell writes in his 2012 book Underdogs The Making of the Modern Marine Corps Recruits have learned in ways they would not forget that what made Marines exceptional was their ability  endure more pain than members of their sister services Making Marines as the corps calls recruit training is a threepart process with boot camp being the first and most grueling test Its purpose unlike Army boot camp is not  train warfighters for Marines that comes in the second and third phases of training Boot camp is meant  create the warrior spirit as the corps puts it over three months of group indoctrination intended  strip recruits of individuality and through repeated exposure  pain and physical challenge condition them  accept and perform violenceIn his 1984 memoir First  Fight the esteemed Marine lieutenant general Vicr Krulak known as Brute spoke of the almost mystical alchemy that happens during boot camp whose shared hardships he saw as the genesis of the enduring sense of brotherhood that characterizes the corps But the lines between hard training and abuse can blur Like every other branch of the military the Marine Corps has official strictures against hazing which it defines as any unauthorized verbal or physical conduct of a cruel abusive humiliating oppressive demeaning or harmful nature The Marines have nonetheless investigated hundreds of hazing allegations in the past five years alone The particulars of the hazing incidents in this article were taken largely from redacted reports prepared  the Marines in the course of their investigations Details like names and dialogue were provided  eyewitnesses and other recruits There is a natural tension between an organization that trains people for lethality and the larger culture a Marine reserve officer ld me Inside the culture youre supposed  be able  take a punch and give a punch and crush a skull Outside this is not something thats valuedThe bedrock of Marine tradition is a longago era when buff male and mostly white combat Marines launched amphibious earlymorning assaults on enemy beaches armed with M1 rifles and KaBar knives Todays far less homogeneous troops roll in battle in armored Humvees or tanks with sophisticated highpowered weaponry and thermalimaging goggles Many never leave their base at all waging war remotely while operating a joystick or writing code In many ways the Marines have become indistinguishable from the ArmyAdapting  these harsh truths hasnt been easy for the corps whose current and former officials with some exceptions were reluctant  speak openly about these challenges except on condition of anonymity The Marines have a purpose and its a militant purpose one senior officer says We are an organization grounded on the physical but wars are not as physical anymore The character of war has evolved a lot from the early 20th century The question is Has our force evolved I dont think it hasOnce inside the doors the mystical journey from civilian  Marine known as the Transformation begins Its pandemonium Drill instrucrs scream from every direction as the kids scrambling  individual metal desks are ordered  fill out administrative paperwork signaling their completion  raising their right hand with pen above their heads From there its on  the phone bank where with instrucrs bawling at them  finish recruits are ld  make three or foursecond calls home reading as fast as they can from a fiveline script taped  the phone boxThe rest of the intake process known as receiving follows over the next few days buzz cuts boots uniforms shots They are given physicalfitness tests fed what most describe as truly awful food and ordered  perform seemingly meaningless tasks like standing at attention while holding their heavy gear in front of them until their arms give out or sitting crosslegged and motionless on the floor for hours Some Marines I interviewed recalled being kept awake for nearly two days after arriving All you can think about is sleep one said Those are the main ols fear and sleep deprivationDrill instrucrs or DIs are revered on Parris Island where they roam the base with a special aura Nobody will counter them one senior Marine official ld me Without them there is no Parris Island Some DIs are not much older than the recruits Only a small fraction have been  war Almost all adopt the mien of an infantry grunt though in truth most DIs like most Marines arent combat troops but rather part of the corpss expanding cast of supporting players mechanics air traffic controllers technicians clerks Some Marines I spoke with described boot camp as a performance The lead acrs are the DIs men and women who for the first time in their professional lives are embodying the macho warrior archetype they were taught  venerate as recruitsTo qualify for DI training a Marine must have finished at least one term of enlistment and be given a clean psychological bill of health as determined  what the Marine officials insist is rigorous testing aimed at weeding out those Marines suffering from PTSD They must also complete an 11week drillinstrucr school where as one former officer puts it they are taught  mold these guys in killers DI school  all accounts is almost as intense as boot camp This is  design every moment of a drill instrucrs schedule is tightly scripted and charted on what the corps calls its training matrix The system is very unforgiving on the DI says Gary Lee a retired Marine sergeant major who helped design the training program in 1995 They never get a break from their responsibilities During a 12week training cycle DIs spend almost all their time on their feet Their voices croak with exhaustion and strain They barely sleepThe stress of the job coupled with the nearunbridled power given  drill instrucrs creates a dangerous alchemy This has been particularly true on Parris Island whose violent shadow culture as it has been described  me exceeds San Diegos Since 2014 there have been 24 official hazing investigations on Parris Island half of them substantiated There is a perspective on the base that somehow you can make a better Marine  beating the shit out of him says the retired Marine general Charles Krulak Brute Krulaks son I have argued consistently that its not true  you do not make a better Marine  treating them that way in fact its tally against what we as a Marine Corps stand for But its a mentality that has existed down there for so longIn 1995 Charles Krulak became the commandant of the Marine Corps and decided this culture had  change Krulak and his team came up with what they called the transformation process which overhauled boot camp  incorporate an agenda based on the Marines core values  honor courage commitment  in every aspect of basic training The goal Krulak says was  create a smarter more selfless more adept and more educated Marine It channeled the violence of Marine Corps training in specific moments the most important being the Crucible a grueling 54hour physical and psychological endurance test that comes at the end of the training cycle and was intended as the final and in Krulaks mind only arbiter of whether a recruit is ready  become a MarineThe transformation process managed  curtail hazing for a few years says Krulak who retired from the corps in 1999 As I recall the number of courtsmartial had a significant decrease during those four or five years when I was commandant Problem was after I left we had a changing world I think in all these years of war we lost a bit of our focus he says There are people who think war entitles them  behave any way they wantAs new waves of recruits passed through Parris Island after Sept 11 the Marines rushed  meet the demands for troops in Iraq and Afghanistan Some of the reforms Krulak had put in place began  erode Without the structure  support them it was easy for some drill instrucrs  fall back on the violent methods they themselves experienced at boot camp In 2005 a film crew from a South Carolina TV station inadvertently caught a terrifiedlooking recruit named Jason Tharp being hit  a drill instrucr at the Parris Island pool The following day Tharp drowned during watersurvival training his drill instrucr was charged with negligent homicide and later acquitted In 2011 a Parris Island drill instrucr was sent  the brig for more than a year after he was found guilty of ordering one of his recruits  record a video of himself masturbating on the DIs cellphone The next year a trainee received second and thirddegree burns  his butcks requiring skin grafts after his drill instrucr ordered him  perform unauthorized exercises under an upsidedown laundry bin on a floor covered in bleach according  Marine Corps documents The DI was courtmartialed in 2014 having been turned in  his senior DI who himself would later be courtmartialed for ordering his plaon in the showers and making them run in place while thickening the air  pouring bleach down the drain After these sries broke some Marines recalled the routine nature of such punishments and how infrequently they were ever brought  light Reporting it would have gotten nowhere a onetime Parris Island recruit who claimed that he was made  scrub the floors with pure bleach wrote in a Reddit thread in 2014 I saw o much other stuff get swept under the rugIn June 2014 Lt Col Kate Germano arrived at Parris Island  head up the Fourth Battalion which trains the corpss female recruits She found a culture badly in need of reform Two of her female drill instrucrs were facing courtsmartial for mistreating recruits and in one case abusing other lowerranking drill instrucrs a phenomenon known as hat hazing Abuses ward the recruits included ethnic slurs socalled hard corrections like pushing and shoving and refusing  give recruits bathroom breaks Germano who spent 2004 and 2005 as an adjutant and Marine Corps legal officer in Iraq was so alarmed that she decided  give her subordinates a PowerPoint presentation on Abu Ghraib I saw a direct similarity between the culture in both places she saysGermano believed that much of the failure rested with the depots regimental commander Col Daniel Haas who had been at Parris Island since July 2013 The Marines declined  make Colonel Haas available for a response Haas had a remote leadership style  not the type of guy that will care and feed you one of his other battalion commanders later said  that clashed with Germanos more handson approach which included impromptu walkthroughs and counseling her subordinates  demand more of the female recruits  help them compete effectively with their male counterparts While many of her Marines made changes others perceived Germano as meddlesomeIn April 2015 less than a year after coming  Parris Island and 11 months before Raheels arrival Germano received the results of the battalions annual Command Climate Survey in which lowerranking officers and noncommanding officers evaluate their commanders In her survey Germanos subordinates described her as hostile unprofessional and abusive Though Germano maintains she was none of those things the commanding general of Parris Island relieved her of her command following an investigationIsolated in a remote corner of the depot the Third had long been a rogue fief on Parris Island its silent pact with Marine officialdom being that it would create the most disciplined recruits but would do so in its own way It had operated in this manner for more than 60 years and even in the era of valuesbased training the Third was virtually unchangedIn 1998 a Navy chaplain Thomas Creely now retired came  Parris Island  serve as chaplain for the recruit training regiment and noticed a particularly stark pattern of abuse in the Third For example he later wrote in a paper presented  the International Society for Military Ethics after lunch recruits were made  drink water until they vomited Then they were made  do pushups in their own vomit Creely worked with the command until 2003  try  eradicate the problem but the blind loyalty of drill instrucrs who remained silent in the face of abuse sod in the way What you have in the Third Battalion is a cycle of abuse Creely ld me recently And until that cycle is broken it doesnt matter how much education you doLt Col Joshua Kissoon who commanded the Third Battalion while Germano was on the base was a thebook Marine who publicly ok a hard stance against hazing Shortly after assuming command he instituted a zerolerance policy on the uching of recruits  their DIs and put his staff on warning Any violation of the rules would be investigated Between 2013 and 2015 221 preliminary hazing investigations were conducted across the depots four battalions 69 of those were from the Third and more were punished from that battalion than any other This included three DIs who were recommended for courtsmartial after an investigation first reported  Wade Livingsn at The Beaufort Gazette in February 2015 revealed a staggering level of misconduct and recruit abuse with recruits reporting that they were choked kicked and punched in the face and that they had their heads slammed against wallsSome junior officers felt the DIs were being punished unfairly though they themselves were never in the squad bays One later said his presence in the barracks undermines the drill instrucrs When Colonel Kissoon received the results of his own Command Climate Survey in April 2015 they were not much better than Germanos That spring Kissoon began  take a softer line in some cases according  Marines in the battalion On his deskp his subordinates later said he kept a redacted copy of the command investigation that led  Germanos firing This could happen  me he ld colleaguesIt was in this environment of inconsistent decision making as some of Kissoons officers put it that a new group of Third Batallion recruits landed in April 2015 Most were straight out of high school A few had been college students Two had masters degrees Another had been living in his car All now learned their survival depended on how they handled the cognitive dissonance between what they learned as official Marine Corps policy and how that policy was systematically ignoredJake Weaver then 19 a new member of Plaon 3054 Lima Company recalls that when he met his DIs they gave him and his fellow recruits a choice You want  be trained like Marines right Not like crappy individual MarinesIndividualism was a sign of what the DIs called the new corps a place where everyone can walk through and become a Marine Weaver recalls and drill instrucrs couldnt get away with what they used  Theyd convince us  feel like it was wrong  be trained  the book he says and if we wanted  be trained right the oldschool way we had  let them beat us and haze us and not say anything because thats how you become a MarineWeaver who grew up in rural Interlachen Fla was the grandson of a Marine who fought in the Korean War His senior drill instrucr was a squarely built Marine who ld his recruits hed served in Iraq He also claimed he was involved in a friendlyfire incident in which 10 Marine infantrymen were killed though most officials I spoke with say the sry is doubtful There wasnt an incident in that whole war where you had 10 or 12 people killed in one swoop Krulak ld me As Weaver saw it his DI behaved like a person with PTSD He lost his temper like crazy Some days hed be supermotivating ward us he says and then an hour later wed be almost done for the day and hed walk in the squad bay and just flip outDuring the day plaons were put through the standard exhaustive physical and tactical training interspersed with classes or informal discussions on moral courage in battle But the real making of Marines went on at night When darkness fell a DI would sometimes dump a bottle of Gain detergent on the floor and order recruits both hands on their wooden scrub or scuzz brushes  run across the length of the squad bay in a bearcrawl position an exercise that they timed and called the Indy 500 Other nights the drill instrucrs would create what they called a hurricane  dumping everyones things on the floor sometimes covered with detergent sunscreen or shaving cream Over the months recruits in the battalion lost consciousness were revived and never ld a soul A few developed lifethreatening rhabdomyolysis a rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue often caused  overexertionGunnery Sgt Joseph Felix was one of Lima Companys most aggressive DIs Recruits knew  be scared of Felix even those like Weaver who werent in his plaon He was pretty frickin psycho one Marine recalls Felix a swaggering man with a shaved head enlisted in 2002 and served in Iraq and Afghanistan working as a crew chief maintaining aircraft and their weapons systems He talked about his resentment ward Muslims whom he blamed for killing some of his friends in the war Felixs lawyer did not respond  requests for comment Ameer Bourmeche a Muslim recruit from Brooklyn and Weavers plaonmate soon became Felixs target I remember him calling Bourmeche a terrorist  recalls the recruit in Plaon 3054 who asked not  be identified He used  mess with him Where are the WMDs Were you part of 911 Though Bourmeche who declined  comment for this article never talked about his faith  anyones recollection the plaon was made aware of it during their first week of training when one of their drill instrucrs polled the group on their religions Weaver thought it was strange He was giving us this talk about how were all brothers in the Marine Corps and how were all in this gether no matter what race or religion we are Then he was asking us What religions do we have here Im sure we have Christians Im sure we have an atheist Im sure youre a Baptist  He looked at Bourmeche Whats your religionIslam sir Bourmeche repliedThe sergeant seemed intrigued Theres nothing wrong with recruit Bourmeche being a Muslim he saidLess than onefifth of 1 percent of the Marine Corps is Muslim Across the entire United States military there are fewer than 6000 selfreported Muslim activeduty and reserve troops or about 027 percent out of a tal force of 22 million Many of the recruits had never met a Muslim in their lives I was pretty narrowminded when I came in one of Bourmeches plaonmates admits I was like Why is he here Bourmeche seemed  be singled out nearly every day for punishment He was one of the smartest kids in the plaon scored really high on all his tests but they just messed with him Weaver says He remembers Bourmeche twice being sent  the medical unit after punitive intensive training sessions intended his friends figured  force him  drop out He refused In early July Plaon 3054 ok part in their final 54hour test the Crucible grinding through 90degree heat Each recruit finished the course and earned the precious eagle globe and anchor pins and the title MarineOn July 14 2015 Felix and several other DIs entered the squad bay in the middle of the night It appeared theyd been drinking in the small office or DI hut at the far end of the barracks where drill instrucrs on night duty sometimes slept Felix was so drunk he might not have known what he did the next day according  one member of Plaon 3054Wheres the terrorist Felix said He approached Bourmeches rack You a terroristNo sirYou a MuslimYes sirAttentionBourmeche jumped downColumn left Felix and another DI marched him in the shower room where as Bourmeche would later tell investigars the drill instrucrs turned on the water and made him do pushups highknees and crunches Then when he was thoroughly wet they marched him in the laundry roomGet in the dryer Bourmeche folded his sixfoot 157pound frame in the Speed Queen Felix said that the Marine Corps has a way of weeding out spies He continued Im going  find out who you really are Then he closed the doorWho are you working for Felix calledNobody sir Bourmeche answeredFelix ran the dryer for half a minute and opened itWhats your religionIslam sirIn the squad bay Weaver and the others ordered out of their beds were pushing a recruit around like a scuzz brush They heard Bourmeches body thud as it hit the botm of the dryer Youre going  kill us the first chance you get arent you terrorist What are your plansInside the dryer Bourmeche began  cry His neck and shoulder were burnedFelix opened the door Are you still a MuslimYes sirA half an hour later it was over Bourmeche damp and shaken was ld  go back  the squad bay As he was standing  his bed a DI approached him Its pretty effedup what they did  you back there he said Bourmeche agreed Youre not going  tell a senior drill instrucr about this though rightNo sir Bourmeche answeredThe next night it happened again Felix ld Bourmeche  hand him his martialarts belt He tied Bourmeches shoelaces gether then ok the belt wrapped it around Bourmeches neck strung it under his laces and tightened it so Bourmeche bent at the waist Are you a terrorist Felix held the end of the belt like a leash He began  walk him like a dog Are you a spyBourmeche in pain began screaming No sirYell Allah akbar Allah akbarWhile the rest of the plaon looked on Felix crushed the plaons flagpole in Bourmeches es Then he handed him a scuzz brush Cut off his head he said pointing  another new Marine Show us youre a terroristBourmeche struck his plaonmate in the neck with the brush several times Felix seemed pleased This is how the Taliban would do it he ld the plaon And hed cut your head off just as quick as his brethrenAnother DI shook his head We let a fullblood terrorist join the corps he said Afterward no one said a word What happens on Parris Island stays on Parris Island  that had been the message all through boot campWeaver one of the plaons highestperforming recruits was shaken During a family picnic just before his graduation he ld his parents that crazy stuff happened during training I cant talk about it here he said nervously After we get off the island we can talk about itOver the next few months Weaver tried  push what he experienced  the back of his mind but it was always there He had believed the Marines was an ethical organization Then a DI bashed his head against a wall for seemingly no reason And another after asking if he was a devout Christian taunted him Say goddamn  That fall Weaver then in his last phase of training in Pensacola Fla suffered a breakdown and was hospitalized with suicidal thoughtsHaving lost his desire  serve he received word he was being given an otherthanhonorable discharge from the Marines His father Troy decided  phone his commanding officer and tell her what he knew The fact is the abuse would have never been reported had I not sod up and said Look youre not going  give him a bad discharge because of what he went through at Parris Island  Troy ld me Those kids werent talking Weaver was given an otherthanhonorable discharge which he continues  contestOn Nov 5 2015 Marine officials on Parris Island began an investigation in allegations of abuse based on statements Weaver Bourmeche and another former recruit from Plaon 3054 had given their commanding officer Weaver claims the investigars spent only 10 minutes talking  him Kissoon through his lawyer maintains that during this period Col Paul Cucinotta who had replaced Haas as regimental commander in the summer of 2015 refused  brief him on the inquiry as it was unfolding Internal Marine reports later described the investigation as suboptimalWhen the investigars submitted their findings  Cucinotta in January 2016 the training regiments executive officer Lt Col Chrispher Lynch found the evidence persuasive enough  recommend that those involved be sat down or suspended from their duties Cucinotta later claimed he agreed We disagree with Colonel Cucinottas testimony says Kissoons atrney Col Volkey As of February however none of those implicated in the investigation had been suspended Four months after the hazing reports Gunnery Sgt Joseph Felix returned  the Third Battalion and assumed the title of senior drill instrucr this time for Plaon 3042 Kilo CompanyAs the recruits sat crossedlegged Sergeant Felix stepped forward I am your senior drill instrucr he said with the signature barking cadence DIs use  exert their authority and then began his scripted pledge He promised  treat them with firmness fairness dignity and compassion and informed them that abuse would not be leratedThere wasnt anything particularly unusual about that first day The new recruits were ordered  perform hundreds of burpees They were ld  dangle their rifles off the ends of their pinkies They were dogpiled in a corner and then ordered  run back and forth over and over One of Raheels plaonmates who shared with me his detailed recollections on the condition of anonymity thought he was going  pass out And I was in pretty good shape he says I remember one kid had a panic attack and started throwing up and I think he peed himself o The officers sod in the back of the squad bay he says When they left thats when the real hell startedOn the morning of March 13 less than 24 hours after being picked up  his plaon Raheel announced  his DIs that hed rather die than continue training He would jump out the squadbay window if he had When a recruit threatens suicide everything sps At first the DIs tried  reason with Raheel What would his mother think were he  come home without becoming a Marine Id tell my mother goode and kill myself he said The future does not matter The Marines ok Raheels belt and boot laces  prevent him from strangling himselfSuicide threats are common during the early weeks of boot camp though how many are serious is unclear Everyone knows saying youre suicidal is a ticket off Parris Island Raheels plaonmate says Sickness or broken bones on the other hand will get a recruit a long stint in medical after which they will simply be assigned  another company and start training all over againBase officials determined Raheel didnt qualify for emergency transport  the hospital Instead he was crossdecked They moved him still without laces or a belt  another plaons squad bay Over the next 24 hours he sat there crosslegged on a mattress in the middle of the room while a shadow watch of recruits shined a flashlight on his face and ok turns moniring him around the clock At some point during this period Raheel who had  request permission  leave the mattress  use the bathroom recanted his suicide threat and said hed decided he wanted  be a MarineThe next morning Felix escorted Raheel  recruit liaison services an office set up  ascertain if recruits had enlisted fraudulently such as  failing  disclose a hisry of suicidal ideation and  motivate struggling recruits  return  training Drill instrucrs who accompany recruits  these sessions usually sit in a waiting area but Felix sod about 10 feet away according  the report while Raheel provided what was referred  as a voluntary statement retracting his threat This recruit thought it was the only way  quit he said This recruit never meant that and regrets it The bases mentalhealth unit deemed him  be at a low risk for harm and Raheel went back  trainingIt would be noted later in the Marines report that Raheel shortly after saying he wanted  kill himself confided  the military police who were going  escort him  the hospital that he could not handle being hit  his drill instrucrs The allegation was noted and disregarded several times  what appeared  be several officialsIn reviewing the incidents of that week the Marines made no mention of the four days after Raheel resumed training His plaonmate though recalls them as rture As one report noted Plaon 3042s senior drill instrucr taught his subordinate drill instrucrs that in order  be successful at training recruits they needed  hate recruits  They were called bitches faggots maggots little bitches pussies and retards A Russianborn recruit was called the Russian or the cosmonaut and was asked if he was a Russian spy Raheel was called a terrorist Felix asked on one occasion if he needed his turbanRaheels plaonmate didnt understand why Raheel had joined the Marines Orders seemed  confound him Rather than simply following them he thought about what he was asked Like a normal person the plaonmate says Its not necessarily wrong but its not how they wanted it It wasnt the Marine way of doing things This earned Raheel who always looked like a scared animal as his plaonmate says undue attention from the DIs Anything thats not masculine  if youre not six feet tall and built like a football player  thats not what they want They want people who are the definition of Marines Anyone else you have  prove yourselfOnce the plaonmate recalls Felix stuffed a recruit in a footlocker Another time he made a recruit eat nothing but JellO and mashed potaes for a few days and threatened that if he didnt improve hed have  stuff him in a locker o Choking recruits until they were gasping for air was common Some of the DIs the plaonmate suspected were almost as terrified of their senior DI as the recruits were One drill instrucr he recalled became so ill that he projectilevomited all over the squad bay while simultaneously yelling at the recruits after he himself had been screamed at  Felix moments before We never knew if it was blood or Garade but hes vomiting this red stuff while screaming and we were like What is going onOn March 17 Plaon 3042 received instruction on Marine Corps mixedmartialarts punching techniques According  the Marines report recruits in Lima Company were instructed  throw a flurry of punches as hard as they could and not  listen  their instrucrs directions but instead just  keep punching It was routine recruits later said for their drill instrucrs  pair bigger or stronger recruits against the weaker or poorly performing recruits During the March 17 drill recruits were punched repeatedly in unprotected parts of their body including their jaws One sustained two broken ribs The abuse according  the report caused one recruit  cry during the event The plaonmate believed one of the targeted recruits was Raheel but he cant be sure Its really all a blur he says It was only Day 4 Many recruits didnt even know one anothers names Terror caused them  avoid making eye contact Lots of stuff happened while we slept he says Or in the darkAt around 2 am on March 18 Raheel woke up his bunkmate He was in pain he said Were all in pain the other recruit ld him Two hours later the recruits awoke and prepared  sound off before leaving for chow Raheel pointed  his throat and silently mouthed words When two DIs started yelling at him Raheel handed one of them a note This recruit has  go  medical This recruits throat has been swollen for three days and is getting worse it said This recruit also coughed blood a few times last night And this recruit completely lost his voice and can barely whisper This recruits whole neck is in a lot of painA DI ld Raheel they would deal with the matter after breakfast He sat silently through the meal zombielike Upon returning  the barracks the plaon set about cleaning and Raheel was called  the front of the squad bay He was supposed  fill out a form so he could go  the medical unit He sod before Felix but failed  greet him properly perhaps because he couldnt speak His silence seemed  enrage the senior drill instrucr Get back he shouted Raheel ran 144 feet across the squad bay from one end  the other Siddiqui run Felix continued Get back RunHis plaonmate who had been quietly making his bed and trying  stay out of the DIs line of sight watched Raheel running back and forth Suddenly Raheel grabbed his throat crying and fell  the floor Some recruits thought he was faking I dont know if he did it willingly I dont know if he was just exhausted but he dropped the plaonmate saysGet up Siddiqui Felix shouted I know youre faking Get upAt this point reports differ Raheel appeared  be unconscious A DI claimed he rubbed his knuckles across Raheels sternum  revive him Other recruits and drill instrucrs say that never happened The plaonmate I interviewed recalls seeing Raheel on the floor clutching his throat Leaning over Felix slapped him across the face Five feet away Raheels plaonmate thought at first the DI was acting like an emergency responder trying  revive him But then he slapped him again so hard that the sound echoed across the squad bayAnd Siddiqui gets up and he starts dead sprinting which I thought was a logical thing  do This is boot camp hes running away his plaonmate says But he was running o fast He is literally sprinting the fastest Id ever seen anyone sprint he says Slowly it dawned on him what Raheel was about  do We were all still cleaning kind of dispersed around the squad bay The doors he recalls were open And he straightup jumpedAn air ambulance was requested  take Raheel  a hospital in Savannah Ga 40 miles away but the request was denied because of heavy fog A second air lift was scuttled and so Marines drove him  Beaufort Memorial Hospital where after an hour of sustained effort in the emergency room docrs decided Raheel needed higherlevel care Three hours after his fall he arrived at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charlesn It was o late At 1006 after more than an hour of attempts  save his life Raheel was pronounced deadThe following day an aupsy was performed at the hospital The medical examiner concluded that Raheel died of bluntforce trauma sustained during his fall But the aupsy report details of which were shown  me  the Siddiqui family also found evidence of petechial hemorrhaging which can be caused  anything from heavy coughing  vomiting or asphyxiation and strangulation Several days later J Edward Allen the Beaufort County coroner wrote a final aupsy report concluding that in light of the hisry provided and the aupsy findings Raheel had committed suicideA week after Raheel died his body was sent back  his parents in Michigan At the funeral home the family stared down in horror at their son His arms chest smach and legs were purple There were ligature marks not unlike the ridges of a webbed military belt around his neck which had not been mentioned in the aupsy report To Ghazala it looked as if her son had been rturedIn Beaufort a city with three military installations that collectively pump over 15 billion in the local economy the news that a Marine recruit had died on Parris Island was met with studied silence Marine Corps boot camp isnt the Boy Scouts one reader posted on the Facebook page of The Beaufort Gazette which broke the sry on March 20 Stay home if you cant handle some hazing Hazing had not been mentioned publicly at this point but in Detroit the Siddiquis Democratic congresswoman Representative Debbie Dingell heard through an anonymous tip that religious bias might have played a role in Raheels death In April Dingell wrote  the Marine commandant Gen Robert Neller asking that an unbiased inquiry be made in the matter Dingell recently ld me that soon after she wrote the letter she received anonymous calls telling her  stay out of Marine business Some of my own colleagues warned me You dont want  challenge the Marines on their training methods  she saidThe official investigation in the death of Raheel Siddiqui lasted over a year and spawned two other investigations a more thorough examination of the hazing allegations in the Bourmeche case and a broader hazing inquiry requested in spring 2016  the Obama White House after the president received an anonymous email from unnamed concerned loved ones of innocent recruits claiming their children were being abusedOn Sept 8 2016 the Marine Corps released the findings of these investigations That same day the corps announced that 20 Marines  including it was later revealed three teams of drill instrucrs several junior officers Kissoon and the depots new regimental commander Col Paul Cucinotta  had been relieved of duty and faced punishment pending the results of further investigation In early June Kissoon appeared before the militarys version of a grand jury and he is still awaiting charges Six Marines representing much of the chain of command were granted immunity or other considerations  testify against him according  Kissoons lawyer The reports were heavily redacted in the 132page command inquiry in Raheels death the last 43 pages were entirely blacked outOf those involved in the three investigations just six Marines have been formally charged with wrongdoing Four Marines  one of whom was acquitted at trial another who pleaded guilty a third who made a pretrial agreement with prosecurs according  a Marine spokesman and a fourth who faces a general courtmartial  had charges levied against them for abuserelated incidents elsewhere in Lima Company Felix and another drill instrucr Staff Sgt Michael Eldridge were charged with a range of offenses including cruelty and maltreatment drunk and disorderly conduct and failure  obey a general order In Felixs case the charges also included obstruction of justice stemming from the dryer incident involving Bourmeche and the hazing of Raheel Both face general courtsmartial later this summerA number of former and current Marine officials including several highranking officers say they are agonized  the reports What Im hearing makes my smach turn the senior officer I spoke  says This isnt rocket science We have procedures and policies and rules on the books against this stuff and people have  enforce them I mean who is in charge If you are having a hard time controlling those drill instrucrs youre not a leaderThough it would be tempting  blame the allegations of abuse on a few Marines  the few bad apples theory  Raheels plaonmate ld me that rough practices in his plaon continued long after Felix and his drill instrucr team were replaced the very next day with another team and after that team was later replaced with another The message he says was the DIs could pretty much get away with anything Lets say you did report something Theyd change the DI and what happens after that Another DI who presumably was friends with the prior DI is going  make your life hellOn Aug 7 nearly a year and a half  the day that Raheel Siddiqui arrived on Parris Island Gunnery Sgt Joseph Felix will stand trial a proceeding expected  last at least two weeks The charges against him are technically violations of military discipline he has not faced broader criminal charges like assault The Siddiqui family thinks the charges are insufficient We were advised that an assault charge was not brought because the other charges carried a harsher penalty says Shiraz Khan the familys lawyer Well the elements of assault are much different and so are the implications The systemic hazing abuse and maltreatment suffered  Raheel Siddiqui while at Parris Island was not the result of a single incident  one individual We arent blind  what Raheels body and aupsy sayWhen I visited the Siddiquis small apartment late last fall Ghazala wearing jeans and a sparkly blue hijab showed me phographs she ok of her sons body at the funeral home Why would they do this  my son she said distraught pausing over a phograph of Raheels neck Taking me upstairs she led me in his room which was spotless almost antiseptic a shrine  a sometimes mischievous yet fundamentally obedient boy who prayed at least four times a day dressed in colorful shirts and smiled so much and so often that those who knew him could never imagine him being depressed Ghazala showed off Raheels academic awards and his orange  Depot apron inscribed with goodluck messages written  every one of his colleagues The dressblue uniform he would have worn upon graduating boot camp hung in his closet neatly pressed The Marines had dressed Raheels body in it He was brainwashed Ghazala said wiping away a tear Hes smart intelligent beautiful excellent boy Perfect I am so proud of my son Ghazala spoke of him in the present tenseNo one from the family has agreed  be interviewed since last winter Their son is gone there are no answers and theyre suffering says Khan who ld me that his office has received only 20 or so of about 220 pages theyve requested from the investigation and have had very little direct discussion with the Marines For the most part he says they have learned about any progress in the case  reading the newspapersKate Germano who retired from the Marines in 2016 isnt surprised The last thing the Marines would want is anyone connecting the dots she ld me recently This is a cultural issue The conduct that is considered acceptable at Parris Island from the failures in leadership  the handson methods the drill instrucrs use would not be acceptable anywhere else in the Marine Corps But down there for whatever reason its considered a badge of honor Those who dont see it that way are considered weak But its not the kids faultThe islands new commanding general Austin Renforth known as Sparky who ok control several months after Raheels death insists they are rooting out the problem Under his watch officers play a more active role in supervising drill instrucrs something many officials believe is essential  reforming the culture Renforth though insists the problems on Parris Island arent cultural This place is such a fishbowl  when someone does something wrong it gets national attention but its not systemic he says That said he allowed I have  make sure it never happens again Renforth doesnt explain how he plans  do this other than  say he wants everyone involved in making Marines  have buyin as he puts itRenforth is the epime of a combat Marine graduate of the US Naval Academy commander during the first gulf war and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan son of a World War II veteran who himself went through boot camp on Parris Island in 1941 This is his first training command and he says he was surprised that many of his DIs were not combat vets A year ago in the very beginning of his tenure Renforth who has five children considered reaching out  Ghazala and Massood He changed his mind I just didnt feel it was my place he saysTragedies happen But a vast majority of recruits he says make it through boot camp just fine We want them all  transform Renforth says If they show up with a little want  in their hearts theyll make it Renforth has no plans  change the fundamentals of training I believe in the way we make Marines and I believe in the product he says In the end its about instilling core values We get kids from all over the nation and we try  fill them up with values he says It changes their livesJanet Reitman is an investigative journalist and contributing edir at Rolling Sne where she covers

Take a recent survey showing a fundamental shift in the attitude of Republicans ward the value of higher educationFrom 2010  2015 solid majorities of Republicans and Democrats agreed that institutions of higher learning had a positive effect on America In 2010 Republicans were 5832 positive and Democrats 6522 For Democrats this pattern grew stronger over time reaching 7219 in the most recent polling in JuneAt a time when countries around the world are doing all they can  attract and retain talented individuals  come  their shores  build and grow innovative companies the Trump Administration is signaling its intent  do the exact oppositeImagine if we had sent half of Silicon Valleys immigrant entrepreneurs away The 44 immigrantfounded billiondollar startups now in the US have created an average of 760 American jobs per company Without these immigrant entrepreneurs it is unlikely America would stand as the beacon of innovation that it is dayCountless analyses have demonstrated that Trump won the election  combining support from traditional Republican voters with a surge in backing from constituencies that contemporary economic and cultural developments have left behindIn recent decades this class has become increasingly influential in setting cultural standards and in shaping contemporary values Its success has provoked deepening resentment  say the leastFar from spending their college years in a mericratic melting pot the New Elite spend school with people who are mostly just like them  which might not be so bad except that so many of them have been ensconced in affluent suburbs from birth and have never been outside the bubble of privilegehardworking highly educated jetsetting mericrats who feel they are the deserving winners of a ugh worldwide economic competition  and many of them as a result have an ambivalent attitude ward those of us who didnt succeed so spectacularly Perhaps most noteworthy they are becoming a transglobal community of peers who have more in common with one another than with their countrymen back homePicture a coffee shop in a big city almost anywhere on earth It is filled with stylish firmbodied people aged under 50 drinking 5 coffees Fresh from yoga class they are reading New Yorker magazine articles about inequality before returning  their tiny 15 million apartments This is the cultural eliteTrump Kuper explains labels this constituencythe elite but not all class members are rich Adjunct professors NGO workers and unemployed screenwriters belong alongside Mark Zuckerberg Rather what defines the cultural elite is education Most of its members went  brandname universities and consider themselves deserving rather than entitled They believe in facts and experts Most grew up comfortably off in the post1970s boom Their education is their insurance policy and so almost whatever their income they suffer less economic anxiety than older or lesser educated people Their political upia is hightax egalitarian feminist and greenThe reaction against this class which found expression in the 2016 election has proved deeply troubling in some quartersRichard Florida in an email  me was harsh in his assessment of consequences of the current antielite reactionThe United States is the first advanced nation since Japan and Germany during World War II  turn its back on progress and liberalismIn doing so the United States threatens its status as the most innovative most knowledge driven most powerful nation on earth according  FloridaThe political backlash from this divide can kill us It is the only thing that can hold back our cities and sp talented and ambitious people from coming hereSuch people have portable achieved identities based on educational and career success which makes them generally comfortable and confident with new places and peopleThe anywhere voter values aunomy mobility and novelty while giving much lower priority  group identity tradition and patriotic expression They view globalization immigration selfrealization and mericracy as positive conceptsSomewhere voters in odharts description aremore rooted and have ascribed identities  Scottish farmer working class

older white working class men with little educationMost are neither bigots nor xenophobes according  odhart and they generally accept the liberalization of attitudes  race gender and sexuality but this acceptance hasbeen more selective and tentative and has not extended  enthusiasm for mass immigration or European integrationAmong voters for Clinn 27 percent lived in their homewn and 43 percent lived 2 hours or more away from their homewn among Trump supporters 36 percent lived in their homewn and 37 percent lived 2 or more hours awayJames Stimson a political scientist at the University of North Carolina sent me his own critical assessment of this phenomenonGive a randomly selected group the choice stay or go and those who choose  go will be profoundly different from those who stay And thus when we observe the behavior of those who live in distressed areas we are not observing the effect of economic decline on the working class we are observing a highly selected group of people who faced economic adversity and choose  stay at home and accept it when others sought and found opportunity elsewhereThose who choose  leave such communities and find their fortune elsewhere are in Stimsons viewambitious and confident in their abilities Those who are fearful conservative in the social sense and lack ambition stay and accept declineGiven that Stimson saysI dont see them as once proud workers now dispossessed but rather as people of limited ambition who might have sought better opportunity elsewhere and did not I see their social problems more as explanations of why they didnt seek out opportunity when they might have than as the result of lost employmentStimson then poses another question Should the Democratic Party cater  these voters His answer is an unequivocal noThe rural working class was once mainstream America the most common and typical of all of us It is now the residue of failed social mobility when most have been mobile After decades of social mobility that residue is now more distinctive it is those who are not willing  grab the ring but rather  remain in the homewn and fear change and others These people should be Trump votersWhile Stimsons analysis is harsh  criticizing as it does many hardworking men and women whose loyalties  family friend community and church may supersede personal ambition  he captures a crucial element of contemporary politics This is the potential of an angry elecrate  provide a key base of support  a politician like Trump who capitalizes on resentment intensifies racial and ethnic hostility and lies with abandon as a means  his endsWhile Trump pulled out an Elecral College vicry  mobilizing resentful voters and turning out more traditional Republicans there are significant questions about the continuing viability of his coalitionI think that somewhere people are a fast shrinking sliver of the American population As the economy changes Frey arguedyounger people millennials and upcoming generations are increasingly moving  where the jobs are and are more comfortable with diversity and global connectivityIf Democrats have one thing  be grateful for its Trumps failure  live up  his campaign promises on health care and taxes at least so farIn practice Trump is going in the opposite direction pressing for a radical alteration of health care policy that directly conflicts with the interests of millions of his supporters and for legislation catering  the demands of the wealthiest Republicans for reduced tax burdensWe will massively cut taxes for the middle class the forgotten people the forgotten men and women of this country who built our countryAmerican politics has become fluid and volatile Income differences have been supplanted  cultural and social practices closely linked  levels of educational attainment Political partisanship is now firmly linked  race with whiteness defining one of the two major political parties Religiosity has taken on new meaning  if one can call it that  with devout churchgoers supporting an avowed libertine In that sense both sides agree that morality has become a matter of personal discretion Partisans impute evil  their adversaries and the mericratic elect have barred the gatesTrump has intuitively exploited this chaos He is not at the end of his string not  a long shot His life demonstrates his will  win His vulnerabilities and his pathologies are also asundingly clear While his critics are convinced that Trump the chameleon is masquerading as the protecr of the left behind he has in fact tapped in vast anger over immigration which has shot up over the past 50 years  and there is no good reason  believe that this anger will dissipate  2020The question that remains is whether President Trump can continue  exploit the fissures he opened as candidate Trump The answers hisry provides are not algether reassuringCollapse,politics
Common SenseIf the government goes  court  block the merger of ATT and Time Warner as seems increasingly likely it may well be the antitrust case of the decade even without the claims of presidential meddling that have already engulfed the deal in partisan controversyA lawsuit  the Justice Department along with its earlier widely reported demands that ATT sell either DirecTV or Turner Broadcasting  gain approval for the deal would mark a radical departure from decades of antitrust enforcement policy both in defining what is an unlawful anticompetitive merger and in fashioning a remedy  cure the problemsThats because the combination of ATT and Time Warner is whats known as a vertical merger meaning that the two companies dont compete  any significant degree in their primary lines of business which are telecommunications ATT and entertainment Time Warner There would be the same number of competirs in both fields after the merger as there were before itThis week two Barclays analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski called the governments threat  block the deal unprecedented and said they were perplexed given the Justice Departments longstanding leniency ward vertical mergersReferring  Louis D Brandeis the former Supreme Court justice he said Theres a populist Brandeisian movement thats risingPresident Trump tapped in that sentiment during the campaign when he described the proposed ATTTime Warner combination as a deal we will not approve in my administration because its o much concentration of power in the hands of o fewThats a view shared  many progressive media critics including an influential group of young antitrust professors who have been calling for stricter review of vertical mergers especially in media and entertainment Prominent Democrats also criticized the proposed dealBut since the election Mr Trump has continued  insert himself in what is supposed  be an independent review On Wednesday even as the Justice Department was said  be putting the finishing uches on its complaint he renewed his attacks on CNN the Time Warnerowned cable news network and his No 1 media nemesisThe Justice Department hasnt explicitly demanded that ATT divest CNN but its a key part of Turner Broadcasting Should CNN be sold it could easily fall in the hands of far more Trumpfriendly owners than ATT or Time Warner such as conservativeleaning Sinclair Broadcasting which has been on the acquisitions trail or Rupert Murdochs 21st Century Fox Fox bid for all of Time Warners assets in 2014 but said at the time that it would divest CNN  avoid antitrust concerns Fox might find Trumpappointed antitrust regulars  be friendlier this timeEven when the government challenges vertical mergers they are usually resolved  consent decree or other arrangements in which the merged companies agree not  engage in anticompetitive behavior and  abide  conditions imposed  the governmentThat was the approach when Comcast acquired NBC Universal in 2011 a deal that raised many of these same issues Comcast agreed  more than 150 conditions many aimed at preventing Comcast from favoring NBC Universal content at the expense of competirsWhile there continue  be critics of the ComcastNBC merger its hard  argue that competition in news and entertainment has diminished as a result given the rise of Netflix and Amazon and the explosion in entertainment options that followed the mergerBut theres also a growing sense that such agreements are easily circumvented and that the government doesnt have the resources  oversee hundreds of such limitations The alternative is  demand divestitures as the government has done during negotiations with ATT Such structural remedies as theyre known are much easier than behavioral remedies  craft and enforce Professor Stucke saidOur goal in remedying unlawful transactions should be  let the competitive process play out he said Unfortunately behavioral remedies often fail  do that Instead of protecting the competition that might be lost in an unlawful merger a behavioral remedy supplants competition with regulationDivestitures have long been the preferred remedy for horizontal mergers where theres an overlap between the two companies Airlines for example may have  sell routes or airport gates where the two airlines compete cable operars may have  sell operations in cities where both companies operateA study  the Federal Trade Commission found that concerns about every vertical merger examined  the commission from 2006  2012 were resolved through conduct remedies rather than divestitures and that all these remedies had been successful at protecting competitionThat hasnt mollified a new generation of antitrust activists Tim Wu an antitrust professor at Columbia University and one of the leading proponents of a more intense scrutiny of media mergers ld me that the deal should be blocked on grounds that a combined megacompany could exert broad anticompetitive effectsSay for example that a combined ATTTime Warner aggressively raised prices for popular offerings like HBO and CNN Rival distriburs such as cable companies would have  pay much higher prices passing the increases on  consumers or drop the channels forcing consumers who want them  turn  other distriburs such as ATT reinforcing its already commanding position in satellite wireless and broadband distributionThis threat of higher prices and restricted consumer choice appears  be the theory the Justice Department is pursuing according  people briefed on the negotiationsFurther clouding any action is Mr Trumps outspoken animosity ward CNN Antitrust enforcement decisions are supposed  be based solely on the facts and law not on politics and no one I spoke  could recall a president who so publicly inserted himself in an antitrust enforcement investigation While Richard Nixon noriously meddled in antitrust enforcement in the 1970s he kept his machinations secret at least until they were exposed  Oval Office tape recordingsMr Delrahim has pledged an independent review uninfluenced  politics Professor Stucke noted that the investigation began during the Obama administration and that its unlikely senior leadership would go out on a limb  challenge the merger unless the staff had recommended itTheyre career professionals he said Id start with the presumption the staff was diligent and followed the evidenceAn ATT spokesman declined  comment as did the Department of JusticeAsked this week whether there had been communications about the case with the White House Atrney General

News AnalysisShe was poised  lead and now is on the sidelinesSupported Hillary Clinn the first woman who had a real shot at the presidency has finally set off a national awakening among women The only catch She did it  losingEven those women who disliked Hillarythecandidate or who backed her opponent Senar Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary now credit the indignities and cynicism Mrs Clinn faced in the 2016 election and her unexpected loss  Mr Trump an alleged sexual abuser for the current momentAnd yet for Mrs Clinn its the latest  and perhaps last  cruel twist in a public life full of them Her loss  Mr Trump helped ignite the kind of movement shed once been poised  lead but that she now mostly watches from the sidelinesThroughout her career many women would view Mrs Clinn as an imperfect vessel for the feminist cause She was a Yaleeducated lawyer who at the height of the 1970s womens movement moved  Arkansas  put her own ambitions on hold in furtherance of her husbands career A refrain Id often hear from voters on the 2016 campaign trail was that they were happy  vote for a woman just not that womanIts now nearly a year since several million women with pink pussy hats and homemade signs ok  the streets in cities across the country  protest Mr Trump Mrs Clinn didnt attend the Womens March on Washingn but the role she played in spurring the current wave of activism has become more clearNone of us were prepared for this loss in the sense that we didnt have welllaid plans  mobilize said Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood But thats whats happened its been a year of channeling catching up  the activism as much as trying  foment engagementAfter Mr Trumps vicry the concerns that women would be reluctant  come forward with accusations of sexual assault and harassment spread given that millions of Americans and a majority of white female voters seemed unfazed  an audio recording of Mr Trump bragging about violating womenTo watch him win was  make women feel like I just exposed myself for absolutely nothing  said Joan Walsh a writer for The Nation and a CNN political analystBut the opposite happened The collective voice of victims of sexual assault spurred  the revelations against the movie producer Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men has become a forceful cathartic revoltPolitical analysts predicted that Mrs Clinns loss would cause women  retreat from running for public office turned off  the combat and nastiness ushered in  a realityTV star who vanquished the bookish dutiful woman Instead data shows the number of women seeking office is rising at every levelIn her recent book What Happened Mrs Clinn is forthright about the countrys mixed opinions of her and about the news medias treatment of her including  Matt Lauer who has since been fired from NBC News after he was accused of inappropriate sexual behavior Then there was the matter of my gender Mrs Clinn writesBut on issues of sexual assault Mrs Clinn has remained mostly muted her hands tied as liberals rethink how President Bill Clinns accusers were dismissed and shamed in the 1990s Even the StillWithHer crowd seems  agree that the MeToo movement cannot feature Mrs ClinnIn an interview Ms Solis Doyle said that she and other White House aides considered quitting at the time but that would have just hurt Mrs Clinn Why would we punish her for his actions Even so Ms Solis Doyle said that as for Mrs Clinn the MeToo movement is one area she cannot goA debate ensued with feminists asking why Mrs Clinn always seemed  be held responsible for the badly behaving men around her The people saying Why wont Hillary go away are the same people saying Why hasnt Hillary condemned this terrible thing thats happened said Nita Chaudhary a founder of UltraViolet a womens advocacy groupIts impossible  know whether the MeToo movement would have swept the nation had Mrs Clinn finally shattered that highest hardest glass ceilingLiberals say policy advancements aside Mrs Clinns vicry would probably have led  a brief period of euphoria and a return  complacency  or worse a backlash against ambitious womenMrs Clinn enters a select club of losing presidential candidates whose defeats lead  larger cultural movements In 1964 Barry ldwater was defeated  Lyndon B Johnson in a landslide but the bruising finish motivated conservatives  organize establish think tanks publish rightleaning magazines and encourage other conservatives  runIt ok a while but eventually the movement surfaced with Ronald Reagan said Doris Kearns odwin the hisrian That was the success that came out of the huge failure of 1964Ms odwin sees parallels  what Mrs Clinns loss  Mr Trump and in her case winning of the popular vote could lead  among women Its hard  see when youre in the middle of it she said But it feels like somethings happening a fervor an excitement an optimismEven before Mr Trump ok the oath of office some feminists sought  move beyond the Clinn years Last January the organizers of the Womans March on Washingn released a list of 28 revolutionary leaders who paved the way for us  march including Shirley Chisholm Gloria Steinem and Malala Yousafzai The list did not include Mrs ClinnIn Ocber the Womens March faced criticism for choosing Mr Sanders  speak on the opening night of its national convention The organizers later apologized and Mr Sanders bowed outLinda Sarsour a cofounder of the Womens March who supported Mr Sanders in the primary credited Mr Trumps vicry  not Mrs Clinns defeat  with the current reckoning among women People were so aghast and felt betrayed that so many of our fellow Americans voted for a misogynist accused sexual predar she saidThe 2018 midterm elections will test whether the Womens March and related movements can translate in elecral power the way conservatives eventually turned the 1964 rout in the Reagan revolution In the meantime allies of Mrs Clinn see something tragic about the Trump era and the resistance mounting against it as the final note  her public lifeI guess every cloud has its silver lining and this is it Ms Solis Doyle said But in terms of Hillarys perspective and career its sad that it comes as shes diminishing some would say vanishing from the political stageAmy Chozick is a writer at large for The New York Times and the author of the forthcoming book Chasing Hillary

WASHINGTON  Beneath the Capil in a secured room where the House Intelligence Committee is supposed  be pressing its inquiry in Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election two dozen staff members await a construction crewThe workers will be erecting a physical barrier  separate the cubicles of aides who serve Republican members of the committee from those who serve DemocratsTo committee members of both parties the planned division of one room in two is emblematic of how far the panel a longtime oasis of countryfirst comity in a bitterly divided Congress has fallen since it began its Russia inquiry last year Any pretense that committee members will come gether  get  the botm of that matter  or any other  has disappearedI think that is a travesty said Mike Rogers a Republican former House member from Michigan who was chairman of the committee from 2011 through January 2015 predicting that the ugly partisanship would erode the trust that the committee needs from intelligence agencies  do its jobBorn four decades ago out of Congresss determination  guard against abuses of the federal governments covert intelligencegathering powers the committee has had troubles before But Republicans and Democrats say it hit a new low in the past two weeks one many predict will have enduring consequencesCertainly Ive never heard of or seen it being this bad Mr Rogers saidIn recent days the Republicancontrolled committee has treated the public  a confusing roundtheclock spectacle over dueling staffdrafted memos that pitted Republicans damning characterizations of classified documents against Democrats benign onesPanel Republicans backed  President Trump put out their memo despite a rare statement from the FBI itself warning that it had grave concerns about material omissions that made the document misleadingEven some Republicans were distressed  the tactics of Mr Nunes and his allies and the titfortat cycle they unleashed Even if the Republican memo raised legitimate points Mr Rogers said its not an investigation if one side just puts out a few factsTop Democratic leaders last week called for Speaker Paul D Ryan  remove Mr Nunes as chairman But Mr Ryan has sod  both Mr Nunes and the memo saying that the document raised legitimate questions about how the FBI and Justice Department used the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act known as FISA  investigate a former Trump campaign adviser Carter  Mr Nunes did not reply  a request for commentRepublicans on the panel say they are also upset with Representative Adam B Schiff of California its p Democrat They see him as all o eager  step before television cameras  hint at evidence  known only  those like him with security clearances  of nefarious links between Mr Trump or his campaign and Russian operativesI dont trust Schiff anymore I just dont said Representative Tom Rooney of Florida I dont know that I can talk  him privately about something that wont end up on Rachel Maddow he added referring  the liberal host of an MSNBC programNothing better illustrates those suspicions than Mr Nuness decision  erect a partition between the Republican and Democratic staff membersMr Schiff said he had no choice but  speak out when he saw the committee failing  pursue leads that could illuminate whether the Trump campaign conspired with the Russians If you remain silent then the investigation becomes a whitewash he saidFor now that inquiry is at a standstill T he last witness interview ok place in midJanuary A subpoena was issued  force Stephen K Bannon the former White House strategist  testify but Democrats say Republicans have so far chosen not  enforce itA transcript of a recent committee meeting reads like a rtured divorce hearing In late January Representative Mike Quigley Democrat of Illinois asked Mr Nunes whether he had worked with the White House in preparing the Republican memo which Mr Trump later said vindicated him in the whole Russia inquiryAs far as I know no Mr Nunes responded When Mr Quigley pressed further Mr Nunes shut him down The chair is not going  entertain a question  another memberThe Senate Intelligence Committee has been a study in contrasts Aside from a handful of public hearings the committee has conducted its Russia investigation behind closed doors By and large its proceedings have stayed there despite more than 120 witness interviews with members of the Trump campaign the White House and intelligence communityAt least in public the committees p Republican Richard M Burr of North Carolina and Democrat Mark Warner of Virginia have projected a unified front While the House panel was churning out competing memos over whether the FBI abused the FISA process the Senate committee staff members were working gether on a joint interim report on how  protect election security in Novembers midtermsThe legislation that set up both committees in the mid1970s envisioned a compact The nations intelligence and law enforcement agencies would share highly sensitive secrets with a select group of lawmakers and senior aides with the understanding that the information would be carefully protected But the authors of the legislation deliberately included a check on the agencies The committees could vote  release classified information if they deemed it  serve the public interest as long as the president did not objectThere is a long waiting list for a spot on the House panel and a tradition  uphold Legislars and staff members like  repeat the mantra that they check their politics with their cellphones when they enter the secure rooms  review classified information or interview witnessesThose now seem like empty boasts Everything now you feel is just being done  set up for the next political posturing Mr Rooney saidRepresentative Jim Himes Democrat of Connecticut agreed To do oversight we need  be functional and right now we are not functional he saidK Michael Conaway a Republican from Texas who has helped run the dayday Russia investigation said he was hopeful that tensions would eventually fade But at the moment he acknowledged it seems like the worst thing everSome senior career officials at the governments intelligence agencies endowed with around 80 billion a year in funding warn that the next time the House committee seeks classified materials or briefings there will be more reluctance than usual  cooperateWhen lawmakers suddenly declassify secret information over the objections of those who provided it the reaction of agency officials

Between Richard Nixons election  the silent majority in 1968 and Donald Trumps stunning vicry in 2016 there have been six conservative waves that swept Republicans in office Disaffected white voters without college degrees have been the driving force in all of themDespite their declining share of the elecrate these voters continue  exercise an outsize influence as the Silent Majority of 1968 and 1972 the Reagan Democrats of 1980 the Angry White Men of 1994 the Tea Party insurgents of 2010 and now the triumphant Trump Republicans of 2016Lets take a look at the hisry of this trendIn 1968 these white voters  often low or moderate income disproportionately male and clustered in exurban and rural areas then as now  were crucial  the birth of the modern conservative coalitionThat year famously southern whites angered  enactment of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act abandoned the Democratic Party in droves and they were soon joined  many northern whites opposed  courrdered busingThe Democratic Partys commitment  civil rights prompted millions of white voters  cast ballots either for Richard Nixon running as the Republican nominee or for George Wallace the segregationist Dixiecrat and former governor of Alabama running as the nominee of the American Independent PartyThe Republicans suddenly became the party of the white working class Teixeira wrote on his blogThe election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 further strengthened the commitment of the white working class  Republican presidential candidates especially in the NorthGingrich claimed responsibility for his partys 1994 vicries Bill Clinns initial abandonment of the themes that he campaigned on in 1992 was in fact more importantThe changed agenda proved disastrous for Democratic members of the House and SenateThe 1994 congressional debacle should be a reminder of what happens when Democrats lose uch with the lives of working people Bill Clinns election was accompanied  great hopes in the country but over the next two years those hopes turned  disappointment On the eve of the offyear elections Clinn seemed like a culturally liberal president who could not deliverGreenberg continuedThe 1994 election was a disaster produced  a downscale workingclass revolt against the Democrats Support for congressional Democrats among high school graduates dropped 12 points  only 46 percent Among white male high school graduates support for the Democrats fell off a cliff careening 20 points downward from 57 percent  37 percentFor many analysts and Democratic operatives Obamas two vicries in 2008 and 2012 marked the final collapse of the conservative coalition Even the Republican Party notably in the socalled Aupsy Report produced in 2013  Reince Priebus  soon  be Trumps chief of staff  acknowledged that a whitedominated conservative alliance was doomed  defeat unless the party opened its doors in general and  Hispanics in particularWhich brings us  2016How then is it possible that this supposedly fading constituency played such a decisive role in 2016Two reasonsTrumps voters were situated in a way that allowed them  exercise far more influence on the outcome in the Elecral College than their overall numbers would suggest allowing Trump  sweep across the Rust Belt  vicryThis apostasy among white voters has certainly not gone unnoticed and party strategists have long debated what if anything could be done  bring these voters back in the Democratic fold particularly since the landslide defeat of 1984Greenberg found that for these voters Blacks constitute the explanation of their vulnerability and for almost everything that has gone wrong in their livesThisspecial status of blacks is perceived  almost all of these individuals as a serious obstacle  their personal advancement Indeed discrimination against whites has become a wellassimilated and ready explanation for their status vulnerability and failuresThe CRG study was equally brutal These votershave a whole set of middleclass economic problems day and their party is not helping them Instead it is helping blacks Hispanics and the poor They feel betrayedCRG found that in the view of the white working class the Democrats are the giveaway party and giveaway means o much middle class money going  blacks and the poorIt has become increasingly clear that progressives and Democrats have no alternative except  challenge the hold that conservative and the GOP have established over white working AmericansDrutman argues thatIf Democrats define themselves as the party that is opposed  Republicans as they must they will soon find themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility as opposed  the Republicans who will again run huge deficits as the party of international responsibility as opposed  the more isolationist and nationalist Republicans and as the party of global business as opposed  the protectionist Republicans They will continue  be the party of environmentalism the stakes of this will get even greater soon and the party of diversity and leranceAt the policy level there are substantial objections  the fullscale emergence of a Democratic Party along these lines It would mean that neither party would represent the economic interests of the botm half of the income distribution  regardless of race or ethnicity  on crucial issues of tax and spending policiesThere is however growing evidence that the wheels of elecral politics have made the developments Drutman describes increasingly likelyIn 2004 those with incomes under 30000 voted Democratic  20 points in 2016 these voters voted Democratic  12 points a 40 percent declineAt the upper end voters with household incomes from 100000  200000 voted Republican in 2004  15 points In 2016 they voted Republican  one point Voters making more than 200000 in 2004 voted Republican  28 points in 2016 they also voted Republican  1 pointAs Drutman points out with a President Trump there is now a change agent  accelerate these forcesBy 2032 Teixeira writes we are far more likely  view the 2016 election as the last stand of Americas white working class dreaming of a past that no longer existsMaybeIn 2002 Teixeira and John Judis published the classic book The Emerging Democratic Majority only  see the reelection of George Bush two years later and the election of Donald Trump 14 years laterJudis whose most recent book is The Populist Explosion is less confident than Teixeira He argues that in this years election either John Kasich or Marco Rubio could have beaten Clinn but the coalition would have looked different adding in an email thatwhat I would say if someone put a gun  my head is that there is still a stalemate between the two parties in spite of Trumps and the Republicans success Trump could fail the Dems could come back and then the GOP Or Trump could thread the needle and win two terms Not clear what will happen But politically  leave aside the Census Bureau  the Dems are in disarrayWhite tribalism or ethnocentrism  whatever you want  call it  is undeniably a powerful force But so are the identities loyalties and resentments of those who have their own competing racial and ethnic commitments The American experiment which gives all these interests participary roles in a dynamic democracy has long been under strain Over the next four years it will now be openly tested The outcome may well be wrenchingCollapse,politics
One of the years most anticipated Broadway plays  the screenwriter Aaron Sorkins adaptation of Harper Lees novel To Kill a Mockingbird  faces a legal challenge from Ms Lees estate which is suing over Mr Sorkins version of the sryA chief dispute in the complaint is the assertion that Mr Sorkins portrayal of the much beloved Atticus Finch the crusading lawyer who represents a black man unjustly accused of rape presents him as a man who begins the drama as a nave apologist for the racial status quo a depiction at odds with his purely heroic image in the novelIn February the lawsuit says Tonja B Carter the lawyer Ms Lee appointed  run her estate met with Scott Rudin a producer of the play for one  two hours  express serious concerns about the scriptAt times the conversation was heated but the meeting ended without a resolution the lawsuit saidThe contract the parties signed states that the Play shall not derogate or depart in any manner from the spirit of the Novel nor alter its characters The Rudin team is arguing it does not and that while the producers must listen  the estates view they are the final arbiters of whether the production is faithful  the novelI cant and wont present a play that feels like it was written in the year the book was written in terms of its racial politics It wouldnt be of interest Mr Rudin said in an interview The world has changed since thenThe play which is scheduled  begin previews Nov 1 and  open Dec 13 on Broadway is a joint production of Mr Rudin and Lincoln Center TheaterA lawyer who filed the lawsuit for Ms Lees estate Matthew H Lembke declined  commentThe Mockingbird adaptation is being directed  Bartlett Sher who has extensive experience wrestling with authorial intent  this season he is directing a revival of My Fair Lady and he previously directed Broadway revivals of Fiddler on the Roof The King and I and South PacificThe cast is led  Jeff Daniels as Atticus and includes Celia KeenanBolger as his daughter Scout Will Pullen as her brother Jem and Gideon Glick as their friend Dill Casting for the role of Arthur Boo Radley has not yet been announcedMr Rudin said he was surprised  the estates criticism of Mr Sorkins depiction of Atticus because Ms Carter had been instrumental in the 2015 publication of  Set a Watchman an early draft of Mockingbird that depicted an aged Atticus as a racist and segregationistThe lawsuit states that the play should not deviate from the depiction of Atticus in Mockingbird where he is presented as a defender of racial equality in a divided south Based on Ms Lees own father a smallwn Alabama lawyer who represented black defendants in a criminal trial Atticus Finch is portrayed in the novel as a model of wisdom integrity and professionalism the suit saysMs Lee signed the contract authorizing the play in June 2015 eight months before she died at age 89 She received 100000 for the production rights as well as what Broadway experts described as a generous portion of the box office revenue and any net profitThe dispute erupted last fall when Ms Carter saw a draft of the script and was alarmed  what she viewed as liberties taken with the source material The suit cites an interview Mr Sorkin did last fall where he described how Atticus evolves over the course of the play in part through his interactions with the Finch familys black maid Calpurnia who has a much larger role in the drama Ms Carter was also troubled  the addition of two characters who do not appear in the book and  what the complaint describes as changes  the characters of Atticuss children Jem and ScoutMr Rudin alluded  that lawsuit in a statement that said the estate has an unfortunate hisry of litigious behavior and of both filing and being the recipient of numerous lawsuits and has been the subject of considerable controversy based on the perceptions surrounding its handling of the work of Harper Lee both before and after her deathThis is unfortunately the statement continued simply another such lawsuit the latest of many and we believe that it is without merit While we hope this gets resolved if it does not the suit will be vigorously defendedThe Mockingbird lawsuit was preceded  a series of letters between the parties as they debated the script In one letter dated March 5 and released  Mr Rudins office Ms Carter expressed concern that Atticus in the play is depicted as rude and selfish as well as more confrontational and far less dignifiedThis Atticus she wrote is more like an edgy sitcom dad in the 21st Century than the iconic Atticus of the novelShe also objected  what she described as massive alteration  the characters of Calpurnia and Tom Robinson  plot elements that she says vary from those in the book and  the depiction of smallwn Alabama in the 1930sMr Rudins lawyer Jonathan Zavin responded four days later defending the play acknowledging that while it is different from the novel it does not derogate or depart from the spirit of the novel nor alter the fundamental natures of the characters in the novel He noted that Ms Lee herself had added  the novel and its characters with the publication of WatchmanFurthermore he argued Aaron Sorkin is one of the leading writers in America He would hardly be needed  write the play if the intent was  merely do a transcription of the novel on the stage Presumably Ms Lee was well aware that Mr Sorkin would be bringing his perspective and talent  the play and that the play would not be identical in all respects  the novelCollapse,politics
Peter Baker the chief White House correspondent for The New York Times had a problem He was hosting a party whose guests included a bipartisan group of former White House staffers and there wasnt enough ice While he was driving  the sre his phone rang It was his wife the journalist Susan Glasser Dont worry Im getting the ice he ld her No no no you dont understand she said The president just fired the FBI direcrHe returned bag of ice in hand  a room full of White House veterans Democrat and Republican stunned  the news It was striking  have all these people very experienced people in Washingn there in that moment he said mouths agape trying  process what had just happened and what it might mean He excused himself from his own party and ran upstairs  writeFor the journalists who have covered the first year of Donald J Trumps presidency such episodes have come  be expected Its relentless the unpredictability of it said Elisabeth Bumiller the Washingn bureau chief I knew it would be really wild and different but I expected him  be somewhat different than the candidate Trump and he really hasnt beenI think he just fundamentally doesnt understand what the White House press corps does added the White House correspondent Maggie Haberman because the press hes used  interacting with  business celebrity and tabloid coverage  is so differentThe White House has settled in more of a rhythm in recent months according  several Times journalists who cover it a shift they attributed in part  personnel changes  particularly the replacement of Mr Spicer with Sarah Huckabee Sanders and of Reince Priebus the former chief of staff with John F Kelly The bureau o has adjusted In response  the presidents earlymorning Twitter habit for example reporters and edirs are on duty at 6 each morning And the bureaus staff has grown from about 70 people in November 2016  more than 100 nowStill much of the unpredictability that has characterized this administration cannot be compensated for  it is a function of the president himself There isnt some secret sauce  covering him said Ms Haberman Hes incredibly unusual Hed never run for office before and he won the presidency This is a strange moment in hisry He has no familiarity with the government that he oversees I cannot describe how strange this all is Sometimes you just have  show and not tellAlthough Mr Trump has avoided traditional news conferences he has developed a habit of spping  speak with reporters on the White House lawn before boarding Marine One  and of going offscript at events as he did in Ocber when an appearance with Senar Mitch McConnell the majority leader turned in a freewheeling 45minute questionandanswer session And then there are of course the tweetsThe result Mr Shear said is that despite the anarchic nature of covering Mr Trump we know so much more about what this president is thinking at any given moment than we ever did with Obama Just because he wears it on his sleeve and he tells usThat includes Mr Trumps professed feelings about the failing New York Times as he often calls it I think he wants validation and that he feels angry when he doesnt feel like hes getting the respect he deserves from the paper Mr Baker saidIts all politics Ms Bumiller said Were sort of amused  it nowCollapse,politics

WASHINGTON  Judge Neil M rsuch presented himself on Monday as a creature of consensus during a sharply partisan Supreme Court confirmation hearing clouded throughout  the bitter nomination fight that preceded it over the past yearBut when it was his turn Judge rsuch reached often for comity during a wellpracticed 16minute speech insisting that he favored no party above the law and appearing  brace for attacks from critics who have said his rulings tilt ward corporate interestsIve ruled for disabled students for prisoners for the accused for workers alleging civil rights violations and for undocumented immigrants he ld the Senate Judiciary Committee Sometimes o Ive ruled against such personsBeginning four days of planned hearings over Judge rsuchs nomination the proceedings on Monday  light on direct confrontation heavy on senarial windiness  set the conurs of the debates  come Democrats raised questions about Judge rsuchs record on issues like workers rights and aired concerns about President Trumps often dim view of the judicial branch Republicans sought  insulate a plainly wellcredentialed jurist whom they hope  install as the courts next conservative stalwart And Judge rsuch ok pains  position himself above politics on the eve of formal rigorous questioning from senars on TuesdayLeaning often on biography in his speech Judge rsuch cast himself as a humble Westerner reared on flyfishing with malice ward none in his decade as a federal appellate court judge based in DenverMy decisions have never reflected a judgment about the people before me only a judgment about the law and the facts at issue in each particular case he said A good judge can promise no more than that And a good judge should guarantee no lessA judge who is pleased with every ruling he reaches Judge rsuch added is probably a pretty bad judge stretching for policy results he prefers rather than those the law compelsJudge rsuch thanked Mr Trump and did not mention the presidents attacks on the judiciary since taking office leveled against judges who have ruled against the administration in its push  enact a travel ban from certain predominantly Muslim countriesHe spoke generally of the hard and noble work of judges perhaps signaling an indirect rebuttal  Mr Trumps comments which he called disheartening during private meetings with senars last monthJudge rsuch did not mention Judge Garland on Monday Democrats still grappling with how aggressively  oppose this nomination were eager  fill the voidSenar Michael Bennet Democrat of Colorado  who introduced Judge rsuch his constituent alongside the states Republican senar Cory Gardner  said that while it was tempting  deny Judge rsuch a hearing as well two wrongs never make a rightBy choosing Judge rsuch Mr Trump has forced Democrats  reckon with the kind of obstructionism they long lamented from Republicans In their 10minute opening statements Democratic senars made no attempt  quibble with Judge rsuchs qualifications or temperamentWhile several members have already said they will vote against him the prospect of an institutionrattling fight has concerned some more moderate Democrats particularly those who face reelection in states that Mr Trump wonIf Judge rsuch cannot meet the 60vote threshold needed  overcome a filibuster Republicans could change longstanding rules and elevate him on a simple majority voteEven some criticisms seemed  hint at the likelihood of Judge rsuch being seated one way or anotherYoure going  have your hands full with this president Senar Richard J Durbin Democrat of Illinois said at one point during a discussion of executive branch overreach seeming at least briefly  assume Judge rsuchs confirmation Hes going  keep you busyBut skeptics of Judge rsuch hope  amplify several concerns turning particular attention  his case hisry on corporate issues and the rights of employees Repeatedly the example of a stranded truck driver was invoked Judge rsuch had written a dissent arguing that a trucking company was permitted  fire a driver for abandoning his cargo for his own safety in subzero temperaturesThe weather was frigid Mr Durbin said but not as cold as your dissent Judge rsuchMs Feinstein said it remained  be seen whether Judge rsuch could acquit himself as a reasonable mainstream conservative Other Democrats argued that Judge rsuch was handpicked  conservative groups like the Federalist Society rather than principally  Mr TrumpSenar Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont said Judge rsuch was selected  interest groupsIn their own opening remarks Republicans often sought  accuse their counterparts of hypocrisy suggesting they were only now awakening  anxieties over executive authoritySome of my colleagues seem  have rediscovered an appreciation for the

Cindy Crawford Peter Dinklage Morgan Freeman and Jeff Bezos were among the famous faces featured in ads during the gameAs the Super Bowl headed in its final quarter the ads continued  fluctuate between funny and somber The NFLs own ad featuring the New York Giants Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr reenacting moves inspired  the movie Dirty Dancing was a hit as was Amazons Alexa ad which included Cardi B Rebel Wilson and the companys chief executive Jeff BezosTheres definitely a humanitarian theme that is running through the spots said Margaret Johnson chief creative officer of the agency od Silverstein  Partners which created the DorisMountain Dew ad That and humor seem  be the two themes of the nightWhile there were no commercials connected  the MeToo movement some still saw progress when it came  the role of gender in Super Bowl adsI was just thinking that one thing I havent seen are those ads that objectify women which is refreshing Ms Johnson said And guess what Theres still funny stuff on the air Were making progressStill some wished that there was more humorIts really a pretty lame year said Marianne Malina president of the agency GSDM in Austin Tex When the TV promos for the Olympics and The Voice and the NFL and Justin Timberlake overshadow a lot that says everythingMs Malina pointed out that that was a shift from the political ne of last yearIts an interesting insight in just the level of risk that people are comfortable with right now Ms Malina said Last year people had a very strong response and now a year later people are confused Everyones trying  get their head around all the things that are going on so you can see how maybe the risk dial goes downBut in reality she added the risk dial maybe needs  go upVerizon was among the brands that ok a somber route Its ad showed images of rescue situations and carried the voices of people thanking emergency workers ending with the words They answer the call Our job is  make sure they can get itIn a culture and a climate where its hard  find any kind of positive news out there at the moment it felt like something we wanted  really lean in and take on a very different message said Andrew McKechnie Verizons chief creative officerThe blowback was swift for Ram after the carmaker used a sermon given  the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr as the voiceover for one of its adsThe general sentiment Did it really just use Dr Kings words about the value of service  sell trucksI think we all agree that MLKs message was Buy more carsNow that Martin Luther King is endorsing a pickup truck from beoynd the grave i think we can all declare racism offically deadIts the wrong mistake  make given everything thats going on in the US right now said Tim Calkins a marketing professor at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management Theres so much emotion right now around race in this country that this was a highrisk move and clearly its not going over very wellI think it was well intentioned but theyre going  have a lot of explaining  do Mr Calkins added They did not release this ahead of time so they went for the surprise They got that but at the same time they now have a big problem with feedback and people being upsetRam approached Dr Kings estate about using his voice in the commercial said Eric D Tidwell the managing direcr of Intellectual Properties Management the licenser of the estateOnce the final creative was presented for approval it was reviewed  ensure it met our standard integrity clearances Mr Tidwell said in a statement on Sunday night We found that the overall message of the ad embodied Dr Kings philosophy that true greatness is achieved  serving othersFiat Chrysler Aumobiles US said in a statement We worked closely with the representatives of the Martin Luther King Jr estate  receive the necessary approvals and estate representatives were a very important part of the creative process every step of the wayThe Super Bowl regularly draws elaborate schemes from advertisers and this year is no exception Tourism Australia  the Australian government agency responsible for attracting international visirs  the country  decided last April that it would buy a Super Bowl spot as part of a broader campaign geared ward drawing more visirs from North AmericaThe form it ok a big movie campaign for Dundee a sequel  the movie Crocodile Dundee starring the acrs Danny McBride and Chris HemsworthWe did a scan around things like the Grammys and the Academy Awards and other sporting events like the NBA Finals and the World Series but the event that really sps this country is the Super Bowl said John OSullivan the managing direcr of Tourism Australia Its such a spectacle right If you look at it from a foreigners point of view its this massive event which I think surpasses things like the Grand Slams in tennis and the Champions League finalNorth America is the secondmostvaluable market for Australian urism after mainland China and one that the agency has decided  focus on in the last six months Mr OSullivan said While many people want  visit Australia he said the trick for the country is moving up from a bucket list destination  a place that people will go in the near futureThe concept for the campaign was created  the ad agency Droga5 whose founder David Droga is Australian Content tied  the pretend movie will morph after the Super Bowl ad and will continue  use Danny McBride and Chris Hemsworth Mr Droga saidThe beauty is theres also a lot of content that moves with Chris and Danny thats sort of them exploring the country as friends  as an Aussie showing around a mate he saidMr Droga also noted that the campaign for Dundee benefited from the support of Aussiewood stars like Mr Jackman and Ms Robbie who worked on it for nothingIf we had  pay commercial rights for those people then it would be the most expensive ad in the Super Bowl maybe ever he saidCompanies continue  use the Super Bowl platform  promote humanitarian causes either initiated or supported  their brands Its a type of marketing that promotes feelings over factsOne final Super Bowl connection Mr OSullivan noted that he spent a year of high

years game drew more than 111 million viewers  and thats why theyre willing  shell out millions of dollars  be on it for 30 secondsLast year commercials with social and political messages sle the show but this years crop of advertisers seemed  steer clear of such commentary and aimed for laughs and nostalgiaIm a little bit surprised Charles R Taylor a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business said Some of the best ads over the last 10 years have focused on female empowerment like the Audi daughter adWomen are generally much less visible in Super Bowl ads than men even as Nielsen data shows that women were 47 percent of the audience for last years game Mr Taylor who recently studied Super Bowl ads from 2008  2017 found that 76 percent of the commercials showed a man as a principal character while 43 percent featured a woman as a principal characterSusan Credle the global chief creative officer at the agency FCB said Super Bowl advertisers may be concerned about looking opportunistic versus supportive And humor she noted was particularly appealing given the social and political climateSometimes when the world is troubled or America is feeling a little  well I wouldnt say it was an up 2017 for everybody  I think there is a tendency  want  balance out the energy Ms Credle said Lightheartedness and a little fun and joy is probably a good

John B Anderson a former Republican congressman from Illinois who bolted his party  run as a plainspoken independent candidate for president in 1980 drawing an enthusiastic if transient following among liberals and college students died on Sunday night in Washingn He was 95His death was confirmed  his daughter Diane AndersonThe United States was struggling with a recession a severe energy crisis and the protracted Iranian hostage crisis when Mr Anderson gave up a safe seat in the House of Representatives  seek the Republican presidential nomination When that try fizzled he reintroduced himself as an independent honestdealing alternative  the rancorous businessasusual politics of the major partiesFor a while he had the national spotlight a 58yearold maverick whose white hair hornrimmed glasses and clearheaded presentation gave him the air of a genial professor who was not so much above the fray as he was unwilling  play  its rulesMr Anderson refused  pander telling voters in Iowa that he favored President Jimmy Carters embargo on grain sales  the Soviet Union after it had invaded Afghanistan He called for a gasoline tax of 50 cents per gallon  when a gallon cost 115   save energyEarly on when all six of his rivals for the Republican nomination assured the Gun Owners of New Hampshire that they firmly opposed gun control legislation Mr Anderson said I dont understand whyWhen in this country we license people  drive aumobiles he added what is so wrong about proposing that we license guns  make sure that felons and mental incompetents dont get ahold of themHe was roundly booedHis backers promoted his campaign style as the Anderson difference but despite it  or perhaps because of it  he never finished better than second in a Republican primary That came in Illinois his home state which he had expected  win When he did not losing  Ronald Reagan  fewer than 12 points Mr Reagan was born in Illinois he decided  run as an independentDrawing support from moderate  liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats and finding a receptive audience on college campuses Mr Anderson did well in the polls at the start At one point upward of onefifth of voters said they preferred him  the major party nominees Mr Reagan and Mr Carter the Democrat who was seeking reelection Mr Anderson peaked in June when he was the choice of 24 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll 25 percent in a HarrisABC poll and 18 percent in a New York TimesCBS News pollHis hopes were sustained  the volatility of the 1980 campaign with its sudden swings of popularity Mr Carters Democratic challenger Senar Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts led  large margins in early polls only  see the president recover and defeat him soundly in the primariesMr Reagan the early Republican favorite spent money lavishly but lost  George Bush in the Iowa caucuses and trailed in national polls before a solid win in New Hampshire put him back on the road  the nomination Mr Anderson said he believed that the tide might turn in his favor in the climactic phase of the campaignSo he pushed on calling Mr Carter a mean and evasive campaigner who used a recession and high unemployment  fight inflation and criticizing Mr Reagans campaign oneliners calling them slick and simplisticBut in a pattern familiar  independent candidates Mr Andersons support drifted as voters turned  candidates who they believed could actually win the White House On Election Day when Mr Reagan won in a landslide Mr Anderson ended up with 66 percent of the popular voteMr Anderson was perceived as the most liberal of the three contenders That label probably fit on social issues like abortion but his economic views were traditionally conservative He preferred  think of himself as the moderate in the race  a selfdescription that reflected a marked political evolutionIn his first three years in the House starting in 1961 Mr Anderson a former prosecur and a decorated World War II veteran received a zero rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action Not long after entering the Capil he proposed a constitutional amendment declaring that this nation devoutly recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ Savior and Ruler of nationsThe measure never came  a vote and he later apologized for itThough his views began  moderate he was still conservative enough in 1969 for the Republicans  elect him chairman of the House Republican Conference the thirdranking leadership position He held the post through 1979 though not without fighting off challenges from the right By then the ADA had put his voting record in the mid40s and he had harshly criticized President Richard M Nixon a fellow Republican over his handling of the Watergate scandal His own critics called Mr Anderson selfrighteous and preachyBut he grew increasingly impatient not only with the House but also with the growing strength of the right wing of his own partyExtremist fringe elements he complained in 1977 seek  expel the rest of us from the GOP He warned If the purists stage their ideological coup dtat our party will be consigned  the hisrical junk heapThe right returned the compliment with a strong Republican primary campaign against him in his 1978 House race With the help of Democratic crossover votes Mr Anderson won with 58 percent over the insurgent Don Lyon a conservative minister But he resented the challenge and his thoughts turned  the White HouseIt was always a longshot campaign Few elected officials endorsed him His Republican campaign announced in June 1979 drew little support as Mr Bush emerged as the only viable alternative  Mr Reagan who wound up choosing Mr Bush as his running mateFor his independent run announced in April 1980 Mr Anderson had  spend millions  get on the ballot in all 50 states as the National Unity Party candidate leaving little cash for television advertising His running mate was Patrick J Lucey a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin And when Mr Carter refused  join him in a September debate sponsored  the League of Women Voters  the president it was said did not want  be perceived as taking Mr Andersons candidacy seriously  Mr Andersons last and best chance of making an impact was snuffed outThe debate went ahead without the president but Mr Reagan gained more from it than Mr Anderson did When Mr Andersons poll standing slipped below 15 percent the league did not invite him back for an Ocber debate the only one between Mr Carter and Mr Reagan for whom it was a turning pointBut Mr Anderson never considered dropping outWe had operated from the very beginning with the assumption that it was a given that Jimmy Carter could not be reelected Mr Anderson ld a conference at the Institute of Politics at Harvard weeks after the election His hope he added was that with the collapse of the Carter campaign he could emerge as a rational and reasonable alternative  Ronald ReaganTo the frequent accusation that he had been a spoiler in the race he replied Whats  spoil Spoil the chances of two men at least half the country doesnt wantJohn Bayard Anderson was born on Feb 15 1922 in Rockford Ill a son of Swedish immigrants E Albin Anderson and the former Mabel Edna Ring As a boy he worked in the familys grocery sre and was the valedicrian of his class at Rockford Central High SchoolHe earned bachelors and law degrees at the University of Illinois and a master of laws at Harvard In World War II he earned four battle stars as a staff sergeant in the field artillery in Europe and later worked in the Foreign Service in Berlin and Washingn where he met Keke Machakos a passport phographer They married in 1953 Returning  Illinois he was elected states atrney for Winnebago County in 1956In addition  his daughter Diane he is survived  his wife three other daughters Eleanora van der Wal Karen Moree and Susan Anderson a son John Jr and 11 grandchildrenMr Anderson had homes in Rockford as well as in Washingn where he practiced intellectual property law and in Fort Lauderdale Fla where he taught law for many years at Nova Southeastern University He served as president of the World Federalist Association which promotes international cooperation and chairman of FairVote a nonprofit group that favors rankedchoice votingMr Anderson was the author of Between Two Worlds A Congressmans Choice 1970 The American Economy We Need 1984 and A Proper Institution Guaranteeing Televised Presidential Debates 1988The most enduring impact of his 1980 independent campaign came in the courts where his vicries enabled later thirdparty candidates like H Ross Perot and Mr Nader  get on the ballot Most important was a ruling  the United States Supreme Court in 1983 that threw out Ohios filing deadline of March 20 for independent candidates Mr Anderson had not decided  run as an independent that early in 1980 but got on the ballot when a Federal District Court ordered Ohio  let him runOhio defended its deadline as a way  maintain political stability But the Supreme Court accepted Mr Andersons argument that states could not impose substantially more onerous burdens on independent candidates than on major party nomineesThough Mr Andersons candidacy had little impact on the outcome of the 1980 election his campaign was memorable for its candor Appearing in Des Moines

As the FBI investigated Hillary Clinn and the Trump campaign James B Comey tried  keep the bureau out of politics but plunged it in the center of a bitter electionWASHINGTON  The day before he upended the 2016 election James B Comey the direcr of the Federal Bureau of Investigation summoned agents and lawyers  his conference room They had been debating all day and it was time for a decisionMr Comeys plan was  tell Congress that the FBI had received new evidence and was reopening its investigation in Hillary Clinn the presidential frontrunner The move would violate the policies of an agency that does not reveal its investigations or do anything that may influence an election But Mr Comey had declared the case closed and he believed he was obligated  tell Congress that had changedShould you consider what youre about  do may help elect Donald Trump president an adviser asked him Mr Comey recalled recently at a closed meeting with FBI agentsHe could not let politics affect his decision he replied If we ever start considering who might be affected and in what way  what we do were done he ld the agentsBut with polls showing Mrs Clinn holding a comfortable lead Mr Comey ended up plunging the FBI in the molten center of a bitter election Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the FBI had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret Mr Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopenedWhat he did not say was that the FBI was also investigating the campaign of Donald J Trump Just weeks before Mr Comey had declined  answer a question from Congress about whether there was such an investigation Only in March long after the election did Mr Comey confirm that there was oneFor Mr Comey keeping the FBI out of politics is such a preoccupation that he once said he would never play basketball with President Barack Obama because of the appearance of being chummy with the man who appointed him But in the final months of the presidential campaign the leader of the nations preeminent law enforcement agency shaped the conurs if not the outcome of the presidential race  his handling of the Clinn and Trumprelated investigationsAn examination  The New York Times based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement congressional and other government officials found that while partisanship was not a facr in Mr Comeys approach  the two investigations he handled them in starkly different ways In the case of Mrs Clinn he rewrote the script partly based on the FBIs expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her In the case of Mr Trump he conducted the investigation  the book with the FBIs traditional secrecy Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized  speak  reportersMr Comey made those decisions with the supreme selfconfidence of a former prosecur who in a distinguished career has cultivated a reputation for what supporters see as fierce independence and detracrs view as mediasavvy arroganceThe Times found that this goitalone strategy was shaped  his distrust of senior officials at the Justice Department who he and other FBI officials felt had provided Mrs Clinn with political cover The distrust extended  his boss Loretta E Lynch the atrney general who Mr Comey believed had subtly helped play down the Clinn investigationHis misgivings were only fueled  the discovery last year of a document written  a Democratic operative that seemed  at least in the eyes of Mr Comey and his aides   raise questions about her independence In a bizarre example of how tangled the FBI investigations had become the document had been slen  Russian hackersThe examination also showed that at one point President Obama himself was reluctant  disclose the suspected Russian influence in the election last summer for fear his administration would be accused of meddlingMr Comey the highestprofile FBI direcr since J Edgar Hoover has not squarely addressed his decisions last year He has uched on them only obliquely asserting that the FBI is blind  partisan considerations Were not considering whose ox will be gored  this action or that action whose fortune will be helped he said at a public event recently We just dont care We cant care We only ask What are the facts What is the lawBut circumstances and choices landed him in uncharted and perhaps unwanted terriry as he made what he thought were the least damaging choices from even less desirable alternativesThis was unique in the hisry of the FBI said Michael B Steinbach the former senior national security official at the FBI who worked closely with Mr Comey describing the circumstances the agency faced last year while investigating both the Republican and Democratic candidates for president People say This has never been done before Well there never was a before Or Thats not normally how you do it There wasnt anything normal about thisMr Comey owes his job and his reputation  the night in 2004 when he rushed  the Washingn hospital room of John Ashcroft the atrney general and prevented Bush administration officials from persuading him  reauthorize a classified program that had been ruled unconstitutional At the time Mr Comey a Republican was the deputy atrney generalYears later when Mr Obama was looking for a new FBI direcr Mr Comey seemed an inspired bipartisan choice But his style eventually grated on his bosses at the Justice DepartmentOn other issues Mr Comey bucked the administration but won praise from his agents who saw him as someone who did what he believed was right regardless of the political ramificationsJim sees his role as apolitical and independent said Daniel C Richman a longtime confidant and friend of Mr Comeys The FBI direcr even as he reports  the atrney general often has  stand apart from his bossThe FBIs involvement with Mrs Clinns emails began in July 2015 when it received a letter from the inspecr general for the intelligence communityThe letter said that classified information had been found on Mrs Clinns home email server which she had used as secretary of state The secret email setup was already proving  be a damaging issue in her presidential campaignMr Comeys deputies quickly concluded that there was reasonable evidence that a crime may have occurred in the way classified materials were handled and that the FBI had  investigate We knew as an organization that we didnt have a choice said John Giacalone a former mob investigar who had risen  become the FBIs p national security officialOn July 10 2015 the FBI opened a criminal investigation codenamed Midyear in Mrs Clinns handling of classified information The Midyear team included two dozen investigars led  a senior analyst and  an experienced FBI supervisor Peter Strzok a former Army officer who had worked on some of the most secretive investigations in recent years involving Russian and Chinese espionageThere was controversy almost immediatelyResponding  questions from The Times the Justice Department confirmed that it had received a criminal referral  the first step ward a criminal investigation  over Mrs Clinns handling of classified informationBut the next morning the department revised its statementThe department has received a referral related  the potential compromise of classified information the new statement read It is not a criminal referralAt the FBI this was a distinction without a difference Despite what officials said in public agents had been alerted  mishandled classified information and in response records show had opened a full criminal investigationIn September of that year as Mr Comey prepared for his first public questions about the case at congressional hearings and press briefings he went across the street  the Justice Department  meet with Ms Lynch and her staffBoth had been federal prosecurs in New York  Mr Comey in the Manhattan limelight Ms Lynch in the lowerwattage Brooklyn office The 6foot8 Mr Comey commanded a room and the spotlight Ms Lynch 5 feet tall was known for being cautious and relentlessly on message In her five months as atrney general she had shown no sign of changing her styleAt the meeting everyone agreed that Mr Comey should not reveal details about the Clinn investigation But Ms Lynch ld him  be even more circumspect Do not even call it an investigation she said according  three people who attended the meeting Call it a matterIt was a thebook decision But Mr Comey and other FBI officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known And Mr Comey was concerned that a Democratic atrney general was asking him  be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs Clinns campaign according  people who spoke with him afterwardAs the meeting broke up George Z Toscas a national security prosecur ribbed Mr Comey I guess youre the Federal Bureau of Matters now Mr Toscas said according  two people who were thereDespite his concerns Mr Comey avoided calling it an investigation I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned  the matter Mr Comey ld reporters days after the meetingThe FBI investigation in Mrs Clinns email server was the biggest political sry in the country in the fall of 2015 But something much bigger was happening in Washingn And nobody recognized itWhile agents were investigating Mrs Clinn the Democratic National Committees computer system was compromised It appeared  have been the work of Russian hackersThe significance of this moment is obvious now but it did not immediately cause alarm at the FBI or the Justice DepartmentOver the previous year dozens of think tanks universities and political organizations associated with both parties had fallen prey  Russian spear phishing  emails that tricked victims in clicking on malicious links The DNC intrusion was a concern but no more than the othersDespite moments of tension between leaders of the FBI and the Justice Department agents and prosecurs working on the case made progress The investigative team did a thorough job Mr Giacalone said They left no sne unturnedThey knew it would not be enough  prove that Mrs Clinn was sloppy or careless To bring charges they needed evidence that she knowingly received classified information or set up her server for that purposeThat was especially important after a deal the Justice Department had made with David H Petraeus the retired general and former direcr of the Central Intelligence Agency Mr Petraeus had passed classified information  his biographer with whom he was having an affair and the evidence was damning He revealed the names of covert agents and other secrets he was recorded saying that he knew it was wrong and he lied  the FBIBut over Mr Comeys objections the Justice Department let Mr Petraeus plead guilty in April 2015  a misdemeanor count of mishandling classified information Charging Mrs Clinn with the same crime without evidence of intent would be difficultOne nagging issue was that Mrs Clinn had deleted an unknown number of emails from her early months at the State Department  before she installed the home server Agents believed that those emails sent from a BlackBerry account might be their best hope of assessing Mrs Clinns intentions when she moved  the server If only they could find themIn spring last year Mr Strzok the counterintelligence supervisor reported  Mr Comey that Mrs Clinn had clearly been careless but agents and prosecurs agreed that they had no proof of intent Agents had not yet interviewed Mrs Clinn or her aides but the outcome was coming in focusNine months in the investigation it became clear  Mr Comey that Mrs Clinn was almost certainly not going  face charges He quietly began work on talking points ying with the notion that in the midst of a bitter presidential campaign a Justice Department led  Democrats may not have the credibility  close the case and that he alone should explain that decision  the publicA document obtained  the FBI reinforced that ideaDuring Russias hacking campaign against the United States intelligence agencies could peer at times in Russian networks and see what had been taken Early last year FBI agents received a batch of hacked documents and one caught their attentionThe document which has been described as both a memo and an email was written  a Democratic operative who expressed confidence that Ms Lynch would keep the Clinn investigation from going o far according  several former officials familiar with the documentRead one way it was standard Washingn political chatter Read another way it suggested that a political operative might have insight in Ms Lynchs thinkingNormally when the FBI recommends closing a case the Justice Department agrees and nobody says anything The consensus in both places was that the typical procedure would not suffice in this instance but who would be the spokesmanThe document complicated that calculation according  officials If Ms Lynch announced that the case was closed and Russia leaked the document Mr Comey believed it would raise doubts about the independence of the investigationMr Comey sought advice from someone he has trusted for many years He dispatched his deputy  meet with David Margolis who had served at the Justice Department since the Johnson administration and who at 76 was dubbed the Yoda of the departmentWhat exactly was said is not known Mr Margolis died of heart problems a few months later But some time after that meeting Mr Comey began talking  his advisers about announcing the end of the Clinn investigation himself according  a former officialWhen you looked at the tality of the situation we were leaning ward This is something that makes sense  be done alone said Mr Steinbach who would not confirm the existence of the Russian documentFormer Justice Department officials are deeply skeptical of this account If Mr Comey believed that Ms Lynch were compromised they say why did he not seek her recusal Mr Comey never raised this issue with Ms Lynch or the deputy atrney general Sally Q Yates former officials saidMr Comeys defenders regard this as one of the unld sries of the Clinn investigation one they say helps explain his decisionmaking But former Justice Department officials say the FBI never uncovered evidence tying Ms Lynch  the documents author and are convinced that Mr Comey wanted an excuse  put himself in the spotlightAs the Clinn investigation headed in its final months there were two very different ideas about how the case would end Ms Lynch and her advisers thought a short statement would suffice probably on behalf of both the Justice Department and the FBIMr Comey was making his own plansA chance encounter set those plans in motionIn late June Ms Lynchs plane uched down at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport as part of her nationwide ur of police departments Former President Bill Clinn was also in Phoenix that day leaving from the same tarmacMs Lynchs staff loaded in vans leaving the atrney general and her husband on board Mr Clinns Secret Service agents mingled with her security team When the former president learned who was on the plane his aides say he asked  say helloMr Clinns aides say he intended only  greet Ms Lynch as she disembarked But Ms Lynch later ld colleagues that the message she received  relayed from one security team  another  was that Mr Clinn wanted  come aboard and she agreedWhen Ms Lynchs staff members noticed Mr Clinn boarding the plane a press aide hurriedly called the Justice Departments communications direcr Melanie Newman who said  break up the meeting immediately A staff member rushed  sp it but  the time the conversation ended Mr Clinn had been on the plane for about 20 minutesMs Lynch said she would not step aside but would accept whatever career prosecurs and the FBI recommended on the Clinn case  something she had planned  do all alongMr Comey never suggested that she recuse herself But at that moment he knew for sure that when there was something  say about the case he alone would say itTwo days later on the morning of July 5 Mr Comey called Ms Lynch  say that he was about  hold a news conference He did not tell her what he planned  say and Ms Lynch did not demand  knowOn short notice the FBI summoned reporters  its headquarters for the briefingA few blocks away Mrs Clinn was about  give a speech At her campaign offices in Brooklyn staff members hurried in front of televisions And at the Justice Department and the FBI prosecurs and agents watched anxiouslyWe were very much aware what was about  happen said Mr Steinbach who had taken over as the FBIs p national security official earlier that year This was going  be hotly contestedWith a black binder in hand Mr Comey walked in a large room on the ground floor of the FBIs headquarters Standing in front of two American flags and two royalblue FBI flags he read from a scriptHe said the FBI had reviewed 30000 emails and discovered 110 that contained classified information He said computer hackers may have compromised Mrs Clinns emails And he criticized the State Departments lax security culture and Mrs Clinn directlyAny reasonable person in Secretary Clinns position should have known better Mr Comey said He called her extremely carelessThe criticism was so blistering that it sounded as if he were recommending criminal charges Only in the final two minutes did Mr Comey say that no charges are appropriate in this caseThe FBI direcr James B Comey said on Tuesday that the agency was not recommending charging Hillary Clinn in her use of a private email server while secretary of stateThe script had been edited and revised several times former officials said Mr Strzok Mr Steinbach lawyers and others debated every phrase Speaking so openly about a closed case is rare and the decision  do so was not unanimous officials said But the team ultimately agreed that there was an obligation  inform American votersWe didnt want anyone  say If I just knew that I wouldnt have voted that way Mr Steinbach said You can argue thats not the FBIs job but there was no playbook for this This is somebody whos going  be president of the United StatesMr Comeys criticism  his description of her carelessness  was the most controversial part of the speech Agents and prosecurs have been reprimanded for injecting their legal conclusions with personal opinions But those close  Mr Comey say he has no regretsBy scolding Mrs Clinn Mr Comey was speaking not only  voters but  his own agents While they agreed that Mrs Clinn should not face charges many viewed her conduct as inexcusable Mr Comeys remarks made clear that the FBI did not approveFormer agents and others close  Mr Comey acknowledge that his reproach was also intended  insulate the FBI from Republican criticism that it was o lenient ward a DemocratAt the Justice Department frustrated prosecurs said Mr Comey should have consulted with them first Mrs Clinns supporters said that Mr Comeys condemnations seemed  make an oblique case for charging her undermining the effect of his decisionHe came up with a Rube ldbergtype solution that caused him more problems than if he had just played it straight said Brian Fallon the Clinn campaign press secretary and a former Justice Department spokesmanFurious Republicans saw the legal cloud over Mrs Clinn lifting and re in Mr ComeyIn the days after the announcement Mr Comey and Ms Lynch each testified before Congress with different results Neither the FBI nor the Justice Department normally gives Congress a factfact recounting of its investigations and Ms Lynch spent five hours avoiding doing soI know that this is a frustrating exercise for you she ld the House Judiciary CommitteeMr Comey discussed his decision  close the investigation and renewed his criticism of Mrs ClinnBy midsummer as Mrs Clinn was about  accept her partys nomination for president the FBI direcr had seemingly succeeded in everything he had set out  do The investigation was over well before the election He had explained his decision  the publicAnd with both parties angry at him he had proved yet again that he was willing  speak his mind regardless of the blowback He seemed  have safely piloted the FBI through the srm of a presidential electionBut as Mr Comey moved past one tumultuous investigation another was about  heat upDays after Mr Comeys news conference Carter  an American businessman gave a speech in Moscow criticizing American foreign policy Such a trip would typically be unremarkable but Mr  had previously been under FBI scrutiny years earlier as he was believed  have been marked for recruitment  Russian spies And he was now a foreign policy adviser  Mr TrumpMr  has not said whom he met during his July visit  Moscow describing them as mostly scholars But the FBI ok notice Mr  later traveled  Moscow again raising new concerns among counterintelligence agents A former senior American intelligence official said that Mr  met with a suspected intelligence officer on one of those trips and there was information that the Russians were still very interested in recruiting himLater that month the website WikiLeaks began releasing hacked emails from the DNC Roger J Sne Jr another Trump adviser boasted publicly about his contact with WikiLeaks and suggested he had inside knowledge about forthcoming leaks And Mr Trump himself fueled the FBIs suspicions showering Mr Putin with praise and calling for more hacking of Mrs Clinns emailsRussia if youre listening he said I hope youll be able  find the 30000 emails that are missingPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersIn late July the FBI opened an investigation in possible collusion between members of Mr Trumps campaign and Russian operatives Besides Mr Comey and a small team of agents officials said only a dozen or so people at the FBI knew about the investigation Mr Strzok just days removed from the Clinn case was selected  supervise itIt was a worrisome time at the FBI Agents saw increased activity  Russian intelligence officers in the United States and a former senior American intelligence official said there were attempts  Russian intelligence officers  talk  people involved in the campaign Russian hackers had also been detected trying  break in voter registration systems and intelligence intercepts indicated some sort of plan  interfere with the electionIn late August Mr Comey and his deputies were briefed on a provocative set of documents about purported dealings between shadowy Russian figures and Mr Trumps campaign One report filled with references  secret meetings spoke ominously of Mr Trumps compromising relationship with the Kremlin and threats of blackmailThe reports came from a former British intelligence agent named Chrispher Steele who was working as a private investigar hired  a firm working for a Trump opponent He provided the documents  an FBI contact in Europe on the same day as Mr Comeys news conference about Mrs Clinn It ok weeks for this information  land with Mr Strzok and his teamMr Steele had been a covert agent for MI6 in Moscow maintained deep ties with Russians and worked with the FBI but his claims were largely unverified It was increasingly clear at the FBI that Russia was trying  interfere with the electionAs the FBI plunged deeper in that investigation Mr Comey became convinced that the American public needed  understand the scope of the foreign interference and be inoculated against itHe proposed writing an oped piece  appear in The Times or The Washingn Post and showed the White House a draft his staff had prepared according  two former officials After the Times sry was published online on Saturday a former White House official said the text of the oped had not been given  the White House The oped did not mention the investigation of the Trump campaign but it laid out how Russia was trying  undermine the voteThe president replied that going public would play right in Russias hands  sowing doubts about the elections legitimacy Mr Trump was already saying the system was rigged and if the Obama administration accused Russia of interference Republicans could accuse the White House of sking national security fears  help Mrs ClinnMr Comey argued that he had unique credibility  call out the Russians and avoid that criticism After all he said he had just chastised Mrs Clinn at his news conferenceThe White House decided it would be odd for Mr Comey  make such an accusation on his own in a newspaper before American security agencies had produced a formal intelligence assessment The oped idea was quashed When the administration had something  say about Russia it would do so in one voice through the proper channelsBut John O Brennan the CIA direcr was so concerned about the Russian threat that he gave an unusual private briefing in the late summer  Harry Reid then the Senate Democratic leaderTop congressional officials had already received briefings on Russias meddling but the one for Mr Reid appears  have gone further In a public letter  Mr Comey several weeks later Mr Reid said that it has become clear that you possess explosive information about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump his p advisors and the Russian government  a foreign interest openly hostile  the United StatesMr Comey knew the investigation of the Trump campaign was just underway and keeping with policy he said nothing about itMr Reids letter sparked frenzied speculation about what the FBI was doing At a congressional hearing in September Representative Jerrold Nadler Democrat of New York pressed Mr Comey for an explanation citing his willingness  give details about his investigation of Mrs ClinnAfter you investigated Secretary Clinn you made a decision  explain publicly who you interviewed and why Mr Nadler said You also disclosed documents including those from those interviews Why shouldnt the American people have the same level of information about your investigation with those associated with Mr TrumpBut Mr Comey never considered disclosing the case Doing so he believed would have undermined an active investigation and cast public suspicion on people the FBI could not be sure were implicatedIm not confirming that were investigating people associated with Mr Trump Mr Comey said  Mr Nadler In the matter of the email investigation it was our judgment  my judgment and the rest of the FBIs judgment  that those were exceptional circumstancesEven in classified briefings with House and Senate intelligence committee members Mr Comey repeatedly declined  answer questions about whether there was an investigation of the Trump campaignTo Mr Comeys allies the two investigations were tally different One was closed when he spoke about it The other was continuing highly classified and in its earliest stages Much of the debate over Mr Comeys actions over the last seven months can be distilled in whether people make that same distinctionJust a few weeks later in late September Mr Steele the former British agent finally heard back from his contact at the FBI It had been months but the agency wanted  see the material he had collected right away according  a person with knowledge of the conversation What prompted this message remains unclearMr Steele met his FBI contact in Rome in early Ocber bringing a stack of new intelligence reports One dated Sept 14 said that Mr Putin was facing fallout over his apparent involvement in the DNC hack and was receiving conflicting advice on what  doThe agent said that if Mr Steele could get solid corroboration of his reports the FBI would pay him 50000 for his efforts according  two people familiar with the offer Ultimately he was not paidAround the same time the FBI began examining a mysterious data connection between Alfa Bank one of Russias biggest and a Trump Organization email server Some private computer scientists said it could represent a secret link between the Trump Organization and MoscowAgents concluded that the computer activity while odd probably did not represent a covert channelBut  fall the gravity of the Russian effort  affect the presidential election had become clearThe DNC hack and others like it had once appeared  be standard Russian tactics  tarnish a Western democracy After the WikiLeaks disclosures and subsequent leaks  a Russian group using the name DCLeaks agents and analysts began  realize that Moscow was not just meddling It was trying  tip the election away from Mrs Clinn and ward Mr TrumpMr Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early Ocber  again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling But the roles were reversed Susan Rice the national security adviser wanted  move ahead Mr Comey was less interested in being involvedAt their second meeting Mr Comey argued that it would look o political for the FBI  comment so close  the election according  several people in attendance Officials in the room felt whiplashed Two months earlier Mr Comey had been willing  put his name on a newspaper article now he was refusing  sign on  an official assessment of the intelligence communityMr Comey said that in the intervening time Russian meddling had become the subject of news sries and a pic of national discussion He felt it was no longer necessary for him  speak publicly about it So when Jeh Johnson the land Security secretary and James R Clapper Jr the national intelligence direcr accused Russias seniormost officials on Oct 7 of a cyber operation  disrupt the election the FBI was conspicuously silentThat night WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source the private email account of John D Podesta chairman of the Clinn campaignThe emails included embarrassing messages between campaign staff members and excerpts from Mrs Clinns speeches  Wall Street The disclosure further convinced the FBI that it had initially misread Russias intentionsTwo days later Mr Podesta heard from the FBI for the first time he said in an interviewYou may be aware that your emails have been hacked an agent ld himMr Podesta laughed The same agency that had so thoroughly investigated Mrs Clinn he said seemed painfully slow at responding  Russian hackingYes he answered Im awareThe Daily Mail a British tabloid was first with the salacious sry Anthony D Weiner the former New York congressman had exchanged sexually charged messages with a 15yearold girlThe article appearing in late September raised the possibility that Mr Weiner had violated child pornography laws Within days prosecurs in Manhattan sought a search warrant for Mr Weiners computerEven with his noriety this would have had little impact on national politics but for one coincidence Mr Weiners wife Huma Abedin was one of Mrs Clinns closest confidantes and had used an email account on her serverFBI agents in New York seized Mr Weiners lapp in early Ocber The investigation was just one of many in the New York office and was not treated with great urgency officials said Further slowing the investigation the FBI software used  catalog the computer files kept crashingEventually investigars realized that they had hundreds of thousands of emails many of which belonged  Ms Abedin and had been backed up  her husbands computerNeither Mr Comey nor Ms Lynch was concerned Agents had discovered devices before in the Clinn investigation old cellphones for example that turned up no new evidenceThen agents in New York who were searching image files on Mr Weiners computer discovered a State Department document containing the initials HRC  Hillary Rodham Clinn They found messages linked  Mrs Clinns home serverAnd they made another surprising discovery evidence that some of the emails had moved through Mrs Clinns old BlackBerry server the one she used before moving  her home server If Mrs Clinn had intended  conceal something agents had always believed the evidence might be in those emails But reading them would require another search warrant essentially reopening the Clinn investigationThe election was two weeks awayMr Comey learned of the Clinn emails on the evening of Oct 26 and gathered his team the next morning  discuss the developmentSeeking a new warrant was an easy decision He had a thornier issue on his mindBack in July he ld Congress that the Clinn investigation was closed What was his obligation he asked  acknowledge that this was no longer trueIt was a perilous idea It would push the FBI back in the political arena weeks after refusing  confirm the active investigation of the Trump campaign and declining  accuse Russia of hackingThe question consumed hours of conference calls and meetings Agents felt they had two options Tell Congress about the search which everyone acknowledged would create a political furor or keep it quiet which followed policy and tradition but carried its own risk especially if the FBI found new evidence in the emailsIn my mind at the time Clinn is likely  win Mr Steinbach said Its pretty apparent So what happens after the election in November or December How do we say  the American public Hey we found some things that might be problematic But we didnt tell you about it before you voted The damage  our organization would have been irreparableConservative news outlets had already branded Mr Comey a Clinn ady That same week the cover of National Review featured a sry on James Comeys Dereliction and a caron of a hapless Mr Comey shrugging as Mrs Clinn smashed her lapp with a sledgehammerThe assumption was that the email review would take many weeks or months If we thought we could be done in a week Mr Steinbach said we wouldnt say anythingThe spirited debate continued when Mr Comey reassembled his team later that day FBI lawyers raised concerns former officials said But in the end Mr Comey said he felt obligated  tell CongressI went back and forth changing my mind several times Mr Steinbach recalled Ultimately it was the right callThat afternoon Mr Comeys chief of staff called the office of Ms Yates the deputy atrney general and revealed the planMs Lynch undersod Mr Comeys predicament but not his hurry In a series of phone calls her aides ld Mr Comeys deputies that there was no need  tell Congress anything until agents knew what the emails containedEither Ms Lynch or Ms Yates could have ordered Mr Comey not  send the letter but their aides argued against it If Ms Lynch issued the order and Mr Comey obeyed she risked the same fate that Mr Comey feared accusations of political interference and favoritism  a Democratic atrney generalIf Mr Comey disregarded her order and sent the letter  a real possibility her aides thought  it would be an act of insubordination that would force her  consider firing him aggravating the situationIn the letter the FBI direcr James B Comey said that new emails had surfaced in a case unrelated  the closed investigation in whether Hillary Clinn or her aides had mishandled classified information and that the messages appear  be pertinent  the investigationSo the debate ended at the staff level with the Justice Department imploring the FBI  follow procol and stay out of the campaigns final days Ms Lynch never called Mr Comey herselfThe Clinn team was outraged Even at the FBI agents who supported their highprofile direcr were stunned They knew the letter would call in question the FBIs political independenceMr Trump immediately mentioned it on the campaign trail As you might have heard Mr Trump ld supporters in Maine earlier day the FBI   The crowd interrupted with a roar Everyone had heardThis changes everything Mr Trump saidMr Comey explained in an email  his agents that Congress needed  be notified It would be misleading  the American people were we not  supplement the record he wroteBut many agents were not satisfiedAt the Justice Department career prosecurs and political appointees privately criticized not only Mr Comey for sending the letter but also Ms Lynch and Ms Yates for not spping him Many saw the letter as the logical result of years of not reining him inMr Comey ld Congress that he had no idea how long the email review would take but Ms Lynch promised every resource needed  complete it before Election DayAt the FBI the Clinn investigative team was reassembled and the Justice Department obtained a warrant  read emails  or from Mrs Clinn during her time at the State Department As it turned out only about 50000 emails met those criteria far fewer than anticipated officials said and the FBI had already seen many of themAt a Justice Department memorial for Mr Margolis organizers removed all the chairs from the stage avoiding the awkward scene of Mr Comey sitting beside some of his sharpest criticsJamie S relick a deputy atrney general during the Clinn administration eulogized Mr Margolis for unfailingly following the rules even when facing unpopular options Audience members heard it as a veiled critique of both Mr Comey and Ms LynchOn Nov 5 three days before Election Day Mr Strzok and his team had 3000 emails left  review That night they ordered pizza and dug in At about 2 am Mr Strzok wrote an email  Mr Comey and scheduled it  send at 6 am They were finishedA few hours later Mr Strzok and his team were back in Mr Comeys conference room for a final briefing Only about 3000 emails had been potentially workrelated A dozen or so email chains contained classified information but the FBI had already seen itAnd agents had found no emails from the BlackBerry server during the crucial period when Mrs Clinn was at the State DepartmentNothing had changed what Mr Comey had said in JulyThat conclusion was met with a mixture of relief and angst Everyone at the meeting knew that the question would quickly turn  whether Mr Comeys letter had been necessaryThat afternoon Mr Comey sent a second letter  Congress Based on our review he wrote we have not changed our conclusionsMr Comey did not vote on Election Day records show the first time he skipped a national election according  friends But the direcr of the FBI was a central sry line on every television station as Mr Trump swept  an upset vicryMany facrs explained Mr Trumps success but Mrs Clinn blamed just one Our analysis is that Comeys letter  raising doubts that were groundless baseless proven  be  spped our momentum she ld donors a few days after the election She pointed  polling data showing that latedeciding voters chose Mr Trump in unusually large numbersEven many Democrats believe that this analysis ignores other facrs but at the FBI the accusation stung Agents are used  criticism and secondguessing Rarely has the agency been accused of political favoritism or worse tipping an electionFor all the attention on Mrs Clinns emails hisry is likely  see Russian influence as the more significant sry of the 2016 election Questions about Russian meddling and possible collusion have marred Mr Trumps first 100 days in the White House cost him his national security adviser and triggered two congressional investigations Despite Mr Trumps assertions that Russia is fake news the White House has been unable  escape its shadowMr Comey has ld friends that he has no regrets about either the July news conference or the Ocber letter or his handling of the Russia investigation Confidants like Mr Richman say he was constrained  circumstance while navigating waters in which every move has political consequencesBut officials and others close  him also acknowledge that Mr Comey has been changed  the tumultuous yearEarly on Saturday March 4 the president accused Mr Obama on Twitter of illegally wiretapping Trump Tower in Manhattan Mr Comey believed the government should forcefully denounce that claim But this time he ok a different approach He asked the Justice Department  correct the record When officials there refused Mr Comey followed orders and said nothing publiclyJames B Comey said that the agency is investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election Regarding President Trumps tweets about alleged wiretapping  the Obama administration Mr Comey said the agency had no information that supports those tweetsMr Richman sees no conflict but rather a consistent pattern of someone trying  act with independence and integrity but within established channelsHis approach  the Russia investigation fits this pattern he addedBut perhaps the most telling sign that Mr Comey may have had enough of being

Lawmakers from both chambers are now headed  conference where they will try  work out their differences and emerge with a final bill that can be passed  the House and Senate and then sent  President Trumps desk  ChristmasGetting a bill signed in law  Mr Trump remains a p priority of Republican lawmakers and momentum  get something  his desk quickly remainsOn Tuesday Mr Trump said that lawmakers were working on the bill so that it comes out very beautifullyI call it the mixer he said Its a conference where everyone gets gether and they pick all the good things and get rid of the things they dont likeAnd below we outline some of the p issues that must be resolved before the legislation can be signed in lawSenate lawmakers in their bill seeking additional revenue brought back the corporate alternative minimum tax and reinstated a limited version of the alternative minimum tax for individuals The House bill eliminated both versions of the alternative minimum taxTogether the Senate changes are expected  raise about 173 billion over the next decade But the possible reinstatement of the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliciting significant blowback from businesses including the US Chamber of Commerce manufacturing companies technology companies and pharmaceutical companies which say it would undermine their ability  use valuable tax creditsThe reason Both bills cut the corporate tax rate  20 percent from 35 percent But the corporate alternative minimum tax is also set at 20 percent It is devised  ensure that companies cannot use loopholes  avoid paying taxes and requires that companies calculate their taxes under both the corporate rate and the alternative minimum rate and pay the greater amountBy lowering the corporate tax rate  20 percent but keeping the alternative minimum tax Congress is essentially setting a 20 percent floor Companies that try  use tax breaks  lower their effective tax rate like the research and development tax credit would still face the 20 percent alternative minimum tax nullifying the value of incentives that are supposed  promote researchLawmakers are scrambling  resolve the issue While they could simply do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax the Senate would then have  find additional revenue  ensure the legislation stays within the 15 trillion bucket that Congress has created for the tax cutsOne possible solution floating around is  increase the corporate tax rate  22 percent rather than 20 percent which would raise more revenue But that plan may not sit well with House Republicans many of whom have been unwavering in their push  lower the rate  20 percentThe House bill guts a number of itemized deductions while the Senate bill expands themMortgage interest deduction House caps at 500000 Senate retainsMedical expense deduction House repeals Senate expandsTeacher deduction for school supplies graduate student tuition waver student loan interest deduction House repeals all Senate expands or retains allThe Senate bill allows owners of businesses organized as passthroughs  deduct 23 percent of their business incomeThe House bill sets a new 25 percent tax on passthrough businesses and builds guardrails  prevent companies from exploiting the loopholeThe Senate bill creates seven income tax brackets 10 percent 12 percent 22 percent 24 percent 32 percent 35 percent and 385 percent Those brackets expire at the end of 2025The House bill creates four income tax brackets 12 percent 25 percent 35 percent and 396 percent Those brackets are permanentThe House bill ultimately kills the estate tax which Republicans refer  as the death tax because it is a tax on wealthy estates that are left  heirsThe Senate bill applies the death tax  fewer people  doubling the exemption  levels  11 million for individuals and 22 million for couples but it does not kill the taxThe Senate bill leaves the Johnson Amendment unuchedRepealing the amendment has long been a key priority of the religious right which views the ban as an example of government hostility  religion in the public square But such a repeal is opposed  thousands of religious and nonprofit leaders who warn that it could blur the line between charity and politicsMr Trump has pledged  repeal the 1954 ban and religious groups have said they expect it  be included in the final legislationCollapse,politics
Common SenseInvesrs have seemingly been oblivious  claims of Russian interference in the election the firing of a direcr of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the appointment of a special prosecur As the second quarter ends this week 2017 has so far been a banner year with major indexes hitting recordsBut as the bull market rolls on some see srm clouds on the horizon Valuations are high and its one of the longest and largest bull markets in hisry said James Stack president of InvesTech Research Bull markets dont last forever So the question is when will the music spInvesrs are on a knifes edge said Michael J Kelly global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments With many still scarred  the financial crisis they see a potential disaster around every cornerThis month the socalled Faang scks  Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and ogle which have led the markets rally  faced a sudden downdraft which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times  come Those jitters were on display Thursday as tech shares led a selloff that put a dent in the major indexesAnd then theres Mr Trump himself whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential  rattle marketsSo I asked some prominent invesrs and market analysts whether they were pulling back from scks and how they viewed these latest developmentsTheres no question that these market darlings which gether have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the markets gains are expensive and getting more so Priceearnings ratios range from 38 Facebook  184 Amazon Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes They show up not only in socalled growth funds but also in value and lowvolatility funds Should they embark on a sustained plunge a bear market could quickly followThe tremor in June was a warning shot across the bow said Bill Smead the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle The Faang scks are showing all the classic signs of being overcooked he added What magazine hasnt had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover Theres no question this can end very badly But the market can stay irrational for a very long time My sense is that theres one big blowout rally left in these scksMr Stack noted that the Faang scks had brief selloffs last June and Ocber only  rebound Still he said the Faang scks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due  the amount of money that flowed in them and the high expectations that have driven them higherBut like Mr Smead he doesnt expect that  be imminent Were not buying them but were not necessarily saying sell Mr Stack said He urged invesrs  rebalance portfolios that have become o heavily weighted in these scksEveryone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market but that may still be years awayHisrically its difficult  find a bear market that wasnt triggered  some extent  the Fed Mr Smead said But I dont think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as theyre going  will have a significant impact What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced  raise rates faster than everyone anticipates The Fed has prepared invesrs for one more rate hike this year Thats where the potential surprise could come If we see two or three  years end were going  see definite headwinds and maybe a market p of some significanceMr Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room  maneuver before scks start  be affected We just had a oncein70year crisis that left very long scars Businesses basically didnt invest for eight years In tightening the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate But were just getting  the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and were seeing more normal economic activityMr Kelly said bull markets typically last another three  four years after such a point in the economic cycle and can even go another eight or nine Bull markets die from excess not old age he saidMr Smead agreed Theres no question were getting closer  normal rates he said That will be difficult for the sck market when it happens People will be less willing  be adventurous But thats still years awayOver at InvesTech Research were still quite bullish Mr Stack said Were not increasing cash reserves We are rebalancing wards more defensive and ouffavor secrs like consumer staples and health careThe risks dont lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment Mr Stack said For political mayhem  upset the economic apple cart it has  irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level So far we dont see that happening Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16year highs and CEO confidence in April was the highest since 2004Nor have invesrs given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver businessfriendly corporate tax reform and a progrowth overhaul of the tax code despite the presidents troublesAt the same time Trump shouldnt be looking  the market for vindication Mr Smead said I wouldnt call it a Trump rally Hes basically riding on the Obama years His botm line We dont pay much attention  politics and thats been a good thingCollapse,politics

A jolt of a movie Black Panther creates wonder with great flair and feeling partly through something Hollywood rarely dreams of anymore myth Most big studio fantasies take you out for a joy ride only  hit the same exhausted sry and franchiseexpanding beats Not this one Its axis point is the fantastical nation of Wakanda an African Eden where verdantgreen landscapes meet bluesky science fiction There spaceships with undercarriages resembling tribal masks soar over majestic waterfalls uching down in a sry that has far more going for it than brandingAs with all Marvel screen ventures the sry has a lot of moving parts but in general the results dont register as the sameold superhero busywork the kind that makes for forgettable sries and strenuously overinflated running times Written  Mr Coogler and Joe Robert Cole Black Panther brings TChallas sry up  the present sketches in his past and looks  his future all while clearing room for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and its other unitardwearing warriors Black Panther was first wedged in the forgettable Captain America Civil War The movie also rather o breezily establishes Wakanda as a militaristic monarchy that is nevertheless fair and democraticThe sry initially involves a satisfying if obvious caronish villain Ulysses Klaue Andy Serkis having a conspicuously very good time an underworld arms dealer with a weaponized arm an Afrikaans sneer and a rampaging cohort that includes Erik Killmonger Mr Jordan As his name announces Killmonger has well issues  go with his striking body ornamentation The bands evildoing ways attract the attention of the Black Panther and an international lawman in the person of a friendly CIA agent the cusmarily cuddly Martin Freeman whose goodguy status is just one reminder that Black Panther adheres  at least some dubious Hollywood conventionsFor a while as the sry and the Black Panther veer here and there jumping from Wakanda  Busan South Korea the filmmakers seem as if theyre simply going  deliver a remix of James Bond with a uch of Spidey shenanigans The Black Panther even slinks in a swank casino with some backup and before long the place has erupted with the kind of choreographed mayhem that  as legs and gowns twirl  achieves lifff Theres also the inevitable chaotic car chase that turns Busan in a video game and dispiritingly a car commercial an egregious tiein that is somewhat alleviated  the amusing image of a woman warriors bare foot putting pedal  the metalFlourishes like this along with an amusingly airborne wig and later rampaging rhinos and the Wakandan backdrop give the action scenes kick and actual personality but Mr Cooglers directing strengths are more intimate There are sequences in Black Panther that may make you cry because of where they go and what they say but also because of the sensitivity he brings  them He makes some savvy sry choices o And so before Mr Serkis can steal o many scenes Mr Coogler turns his attention  Killmonger and pushes the movie in another direction away from a white villain wronging black people  black people living their livesPart of the movies pleasure and its ethos  which wends through its visuals  is how it dispenses with familiar eitheror divides including the binary opposition that tends  shape our discourse on race Life in Wakanda is at once urban and rural futuristic and traditional technological and mystical Spaceships zoom over soaring buildings with thatched ps a hover train zips over a market with hanging woven baskets In one of the most striking locales an openair throne room is horizontally lined with suspended tree limbs creating a loose pattern that pointedly blurs the divide between the interior and exterior worlds and is echoed  the fretwork in costumes and other setsThe rejection of the eitheror divide extends  Killmonger whose emotional fraught back sry gives the movie more heft and realworld friction than any of Marvels other superhero blowouts Like a lot of adventures Black Panther turns on a familiar fatherandson drama  theres an assassination a power vacuum and a somewhat reluctant heir  a patrilineal intrigue that is filled in here with intense faceoffs involving questions of ancestry identity the African diaspora the new world and the old One particularly moving narrative thread features Sterling K Brown a tremulous vibrantly sensitive acr who conveys entire chapters of grief He could outweep Juliette BinocheMr Jordan is a terrifically charismatic presence and there are times when you wonder if he might have made a better Black Panther Mr Bosemans magnetism is more slowburning and his performance is more physically restrained than Mr Jordan even deliberate though he has his splashier freewheeling moments including some handhand grappling Wrestling is big in Wakanda hence a few sexy smackdowns featuring acres of bare skin and jumping muscle Like many other Wakandans he speaks in English with a South African lilt an accent that vividly summons up Nelson Mandela and suggests that TChalla will soon be assuming the role of international diplomatIts important  the movies politics and mythbuilding that he is surrounded  a phalanx of women among them a battalion of women warriors called the Dora Milaje These arent moviedoms irritatingly ken strong chicks the ugh babes with sizable biceps and skills but no real roles For all his father issues TChalla is enveloped  women who cushion him in maternal military sisterly and scientific support A female general Danai Gurira stands  his side his ba sister a vivacious Letitia Wright provides gadgets and withering asides  la Bonds gadget guy Angela Bassett swans in as the royal mother while Lupita Nyongo as a spy makes the case for her own spinoffBuoyed  its groovy women and Afrofuturist flourishes Wakanda itself is finally the movies strength its rallying cry and state of mind Early on a white character carelessly describes it as a third world country  textiles shepherds cool outfits Part of the joke which the movie wittily engages is that Wakanda certainly fits that profile except that its shepherds patrol the border with technowizardry and its textiles and costumes dazzle because of the countrys secret vibranium sauce More critically having never been conquered Wakanda has evaded the hisrical traumas endured  much of the rest of Africa freeing it from the ravages of both colonialism and postcolonialismRace matters in Black Panther and it matters deeply not in terms of Manichaean good guys and bad but as a means  explore larger human concerns about the past the present and the uses and abuses of power That alone makes it more thoughtful about how the world works than a lot of mainstream movies even if those ideas are interspersed with plenty of comicbook posturing It wouldnt be a Marvel production without manly skirmishes and digital avatars Yet in its emphasis on black imagination creation and liberation the movie becomes an emblem of a past that was denied and a future that feels very present And in doing so opens up its world and yours beautifullyMovie data powered

Heres a question very few people expected  be asking this year Does the Democratic Party have a futureThe defeat of Hillary Clinn has revived with new intensity the conflict between proponents of identity politics  focusing elecral attention on AfricanAmericans Hispanics women and the LGBT community  and those who advocate what they describe as a more universal strategyAmerican liberalism has slipped in a kind of moral panic about racial gender and sexual identity that has disrted liberalisms message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governingLilla called for a postidentity liberalism that wouldconcentrate on widening its base  appealing  Americans as Americans and emphasizing the issues that affect a vast majority of themThe reaction was swift and fierceIn the new political climate we now inhabit Duke and Lilla were contributing  the same ideological project the former cloaked in a KKK hood the latter in an academic gown Both men are underwriting the whitening of American nationalism and the recentering of white lives as lives that matter most in the US Duke is happy  own the white supremacy of his statements while Lillas oped does the more nefarious background work of making white supremacy respectable AgainOn the surface it looks as if there is no way  find common ground between these warring camps But in fact it is not an eitheror choice its really a matter of emphasisIn her brief public statement at 10 Downing Street on July 13 May broached Britains version of identity politics She declared her commitment  battle burning injusticesIf you are born poor you will die on average nine years earlier than others If youre black youre treated more harshly  the criminal justice system than if you are white If youre a white workingclass boy youre less likely than anyone else in Britain  go  university If youre at a state school youre less likely  reach the p professions than if you were educated privately If you are a woman you will earn less than a man If you suffer from mental health problems theres not enough help  handWhile acknowledging the legitimacy of these deep and abiding problems May made the case that the larger issue facing British society is the struggle of all those trying  make ends meetThe mission  make Britain a country that works for everyone means more than just fighting these injustices If youre from an ordinary workingclass family life is much harder than many people in Westminster realize You have the job but you dont always have the job security You have your own home but you worry about paying the mortgage You can just about manage but you worry about the cost of living and getting your kids in a good schoolThe core mission of the May government she promised would be  lighten the burdens on such ordinary working class familiesWe will do everything we can  give you more control over your lives When we take the big calls well think not of the powerful but you When we pass new laws well listen not  the mighty but you When it comes  taxes well prioritize not the wealthy but you When it comes  opportunity we wont entrench the advantages of the fortunate few We will do everything we can  help anybody whatever your background  go as far as your talents will take youIn other words May attempted  address the specific problems of key identity groups but emphasized that her p priority would be the concerns of all workers regardless of race sex or ethnicity The challenge for Democrats in this country going forward is  selfmonir more assiduously for divergence from the MayTimothy strategy Successful Democratic candidates have often done just thatTaxes were lowered on the wealthiest people whose incomes were rising and raised on middle class families as their incomes fell And through it all millions of decent ordinary people who worked hard played  the rules and ok responsibility for their own actions were falling more and more behind living a life of struggle without reward or securityI want  set our party and our country on the path ward the new center ground of British politics built on the values of fairness and opportunity where everyone plays  the same rules and where every single person  regardless of their background or that of their parents  is given the chance  be all they want  beIn a Clinn Administration we are going  create opportunity for all Weve got  grow this economy not shrink it We need  give people incentives  make long  term investment in America and reward people who produce goods and services not those who speculate with other peoples money Weve got  invest more money in emerging technologies  help keep highpaying jobs here at homeTwo and a half decades later May saidWe also value something else the spirit of citizenshipThat spirit that means you respect the bonds and obligations that make our society work That means a commitment  the men and women who live around you who work for you who buy the goods and services you sell That spirit that means recognizing the social contract that says you train up local young people before you take on cheap labor from overseas That spirit that means you do as others do and pay your fair share of taxEven when speaking before civil rights and womens rights groups Obama ok pains  avoid particularistic appealsWhen any human being is denied a life of dignity and

theyre going without the medicines that they so desperately need  we have more work  do Thats what this election is all about Its about the responsibilities we all share for the future we hold in commonNot black America or white America Not rich America or poor America rural America or urban America but all America An America where no childs destiny is determined before shes born  and no ones future is confined  the neighborhood hes born in An America where hard work is still a ticket  the middle class  and you can make it if you tryYou see corporations making record profits with CEOs making record pay but your paychecks have barely budged While many of you are working multiple jobs  make ends meet you see the p 25 hedge fund managers making more than all of Americas kindergarten teachers combined And often paying a lower tax rate So you have  wonder When does my hard work pay off When does my family get aheadThe difference in the rherical strategy of Hillary Clinn and Theresa May is one of stress and underscoring While May made sure her identity group stands were secondary  her pronounced commitment  the working men and women of England generally Clinn frequently placed

overnightNoEarlier at a primary debate on CNN Anderson Cooper asked her Secretary Clinn how would you not be a third term of President ObamaClinn repliedWell I think thats pretty obvious I think being

nothing about how a Clinn presidency would improve their lives in ways that the Obama presidency had notDonald Trump won the presidency on an identity politics counterpunch the mobilization of angry white voters most of them men White men supported Trump over Hillary Clinn 62 percent  31 percent while white women supported Trump  a more modest margin 52  43 Clinns emphasis on her gender appears  have helped Trump in key battlegroundsThe approach developed  May and her staff and  the Obama and Bill Clinn campaigns before her addresses a question that nags at Democratic strategists How do you establish a commonweal when everyone is looking  have his or her own concerns ratifiedThe tried and true way for a politician  market a coalitional regime amid a cacophony of particularistic demands is  forcefully assert the primacy of the whole This worked for the Obama insurgency in 2008 because his coalition members were willing  temporarily suspend their immediate demands in favor of a more encompassing vicryLooking ward the future Democrats might turn the tables on the Republicans and explicitly demonize Trump and his party as proponents of an exclusionary politics of white male identityBut it is also legitimate  ask whether the age of identity politics is coming  an end One lesson of 2016 is that opposition  multiculturalism has become an extraordinarily powerful mobilizing ol for the right It has spurred the emergence of a white lower and middleincome Republican party while simultaneously invigorating the formerly insignificant altright and white supremacists generallyIt would be simplistic  make identity politics the sole culprit of this years Democratic defeat especially in light of Clinns 24 million popular vote margin While universalistic appeals have a certain allure in the face of particularistic clamor it is unlikely that either identity politics or its hyperactive watchdog political correctness  the current whipping boys of postelection analysis  will disappear anytime soonEarlier traditional societies imposed clear frameworks and roles upon individuals but with postindustrial modernization identity became individualized and pluralized Individuals became more focused on selfdetermination and selfexpression An individuals identity is neither a stable nor a finished entity Contemporary societies generate possibilities of creating new identities The last ten years have been dominated  incomplete ever more fragmented identities composed of multiplied and individualized persons The world we live in creates new forms and breeds fragmentedness Pluralization of forms of agency the many sources of authority an individual can invoke and the chance  choose a lifestyle have become increasingly important in creating an identityThis has been such a profound transformation that now themeaning of the concept of identity is ambivalent and presupposes both a positive identification with other people groups collectives cultures and a negative identification differentiation with all a person is notIdentity as a key aspect of human and thus political behavior is a reality Should the Democrats strive for more subtle sophisticated and ingenious appeals  their partys crosssection of identities including a revivification of the idea of the commonweal I would say emphatically yes Trumps recent vicry notwithstanding the debate over how  do this needs  move forward on a higher plane without the name calling if it is  have any chance of successCollapse,politics

WASHINGTON  For years a coalition of wellfunded groups on the religious right have waged an uphill battle  repeal a 1954 law that bans churches and other nonprofit groups from engaging in political activityNow those groups are edging ward a onceimprobable vicry as Republican lawmakers with the enthusiastic backing of President Trump prepare  rewrite large swaths of the United States tax code as part of the 15 trillion tax package moving through CongressThe change could turn churches in a wellfunded political force with donors diverting as much as 17 billion each year from traditional political committees  churches and other nonprofit groups that could legally engage in partisan politics for the first time according  an estimate  the nonpartisan congressional Joint Committee on TaxationSenate leaders would need  win over several Republican senars  pass a tax overhaulWith time running out for Republicans  deliver a major legislative vicry after nearly a year of stalemate on the partys p agenda items lawmakers appear poised  agree  lastminute changes and tweaks  try  ensure the bills passage so it can be delivered  President Trump  Christmas Tax bill negotiations are expected  kick in high gear on Monday as lawmakers return  Washingn with just a handful of legislative days left and big issues  contend with including the need  pass a funding measure  keep the government open beyond Dec 8 and action  protect the young undocumented immigrants known as DreamersThe need for a legislative vicry is giving comfort  those on the religious right that the final bill sent  the president will include the House language which was drafted with significant input from evangelical groupsThe sudden movement ward their goal appears  trace back  a January 2016 meeting that Mr Trump then a presidential candidate had convened at his Trump Tower office in Manhattan with evangelical leaders he was courtingThat meeting helped lead  a campaign pledge  Mr Trump  repeal the ban known as the Johnson Amendment and set the stage for its inclusion in the tax code overhaul that passed the HouseIt will bring the partisan divide  our doors said Jatrice Martel Gaiter the executive vice president of external affairs for Volunteers of America a ministry and social service provider that receives about 70 percent of its funding from the government If the Senate doesnt sp this there will be havoc in the nonprofit secrChristian conservative leaders contend that the provision in the House bill was drafted narrowly  avoid any such abuse and they cast the issue as a matter of constitutional rights rather than politicsBoth sides agree that repealing or dialing back the Johnson Amendment seemed improbable at best as recently as a year and a half ago That was when Mr Trumps surprising embrace injected new life in it and helped spark an alliance that benefited his campaign and the religious rightThats the way the world works The world is transactional What can we pursue that is mutually beneficial said Tony Perkins a leading figure on the Christian right who is the president of the Family Research Council His group has been working against the Johnson Amendment for more than a decade The awareness was building but the real catalyst of this conversation was Donald TrumpConservative Christian leaders say Mr Trump seized on the issue at the January meeting in his office He asked why Christian organizations and churches did not speak out more on the public policy issues said Jerry A Johnson the president and chief executive of the National Religious BroadcastersMr Trump cited a specific conversation he had with a pasr whom hed met along the journey who didnt feel he could endorse him but he wanted  said Johnnie Moore a Christian publicist who was appointed  Mr Trumps evangelical board Mr Trump said the Johnson Amendment which threatens religious organizations and charities with loss of their taxexempt status if they endorse or oppose political candidates had created a situation in which some of his most committed supporters were careful about the language they used publicly about him Mr Moore said He added that the candidate appeared  be genuinely upset that the federal government would attempt  bully these organizations in this wayAt his behest the repeal effort was included in the Republican platform for the first time Nobody else would even think about doing it Mr Trump boasted explaining it was for the evangelicals without whom he said I could not have won this nominationThe order was almost immediately challenged in federal court  the nonprofit Freedom From Religion Foundation which said the order gave preference  religion over nonreligionNonetheless conservative Christian leaders have increasingly seized on the Johnson Amendment as an example of what they see as government hostility  religion in the public squareIn 2008 Mr Farriss group began an effort  overturn the Johnson Amendment in court through an annual civil disobedience protest called Pulpit Freedom Sunday His group and Mr Perkinss group helped recruit pasrs  deliver overtly political sermons and transmit the recordings  the IRS The aim was  tempt the agency  try  revoke the churches tax exemption giving them standing  challenge the constitutionality of the Johnson Amendment in court It has yet  take the baitOther opponents began efforts  repeal the ban in Congress Bills  do so were supported  powerful Christian conservative groups including Mr Perkinss Family Research Council the Christian Coalition and the Traditional Values Coalition according  lobing filingsA more nuanced approach emerged from an interfaith commission convened in 2011  another nonprofit group the Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability which suggested leaving the Johnson Amendment intact but allowing churches and other nonprofit groups  support or oppose candidates in the ordinary course of an organizations regular and cusmary activities provided the amount spent on such activity was de minimisThe recommendations became the basis for a bill called the Free Speech Fairness Act which was introduced last year in the House  Representative Steve Scalise Republican of Louisiana and this year in the Senate  Mr Lankford and for the language in the House tax billKenneth P Vogel reported from Washingn and Laurie odstein from New

Common SenseHaving reached the p of a major corporation and amassed a fortune chief executives often wonder Whats nextAfter Donald J Trump the answer may well be a run for the White HouseMr Trump had no political or military experience the traditional routes  high political office Virtually his only qualification was his business career and a checkered one at that considering his own brush with personal bankruptcyThere is this sense that if Trump got it why shouldnt they said David Gergen codirecr of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School and an adviser  four presidents Theyve been more successful they have more experience and theyve run a public company which is more equivalent  what a president does than a private company like the Trump OrganizationStu Loeser once the press secretary for Michael R Bloomberg the former New York mayor who considered a presidential run last year concurred If you run a company that has employed tens of thousands of people and generated lots of profit and been undeniably successful and you look at a sitting president who  be honest a lot of business people dont have much respect for you think why not me he saidMr Loeser now runs his own strategic consulting firm and ld me he has clients who are business executives considering a run for high public office I cant tell you their names obviously he saidBoldface corporate names widely discussed as contenders for the next Democratic presidential nomination include chief executives like Howard Schultz of Starbucks Robert A Iger of Disney and Marc Benioff of Salesforcecom along with Sheryl Sandberg the Facebook chief operating officer and Oprah Winfrey chairwoman and chief executive of Harpo Inc which owns half of the Oprah Winfrey NetworkAll deny theyre running or even seriously considering it But everyone demurs so far ahead of the first primaries as did Hillary Clinn four years ago and it hasnt spped anyone from speculating Thats especially the case for people who appalled  the Trump administration can hardly wait for the next campaignI feel many of these chief executives are responding  a public longing for a strongman or woman a strong leader Mr Gergen said Theres a sense thats why Trump got elected Youre seeing the same thing in Europe in Asia in a long list of countries People are dissatisfied with standard politicians Military types and business people with a strong track record offer an attractive alternativeApart from proven business experience they have widespread name recognition or identification with major consumer brands And they have enough money  finance their own campaignsIve spoken this week  multiple people who have at least discussed the possibility of running for office with Mr Schultz and Mr Iger All declined  be named discussing what were private conversationsMr Schultz 63 with a fortune estimated  Forbes at 3 billion came close  making a bid last year but backed out after concluding it would be very difficult  defeat Mrs Clinn who seemed  have the Democratic nomination all but locked up and at the time seemed likely  win the presidencyThose circumstances have obviously changed drastically With Mr Trump in office the next Democratic race appears wide open and many friends and potential donors are urging Mr Schultz  runMr Schultz seemed  pave the way in December when he announced hed step down as Starbucks chief executive this April But he continues  be actively involved in the expansion of the companys highend roasteries as well as its socialimpact initiativesHoward Schultz is definitely being pursued Mr Gergen said He has a powerful social conscience He comes from a very different place than the kind of chief executive with a big ego who wants the trappings of presidential powerMr Schultz declined  commentLast year Mr Iger 66 ld The Hollywood Reporter that a lot of people  a lot  have urged me  seek political office and last week the entertainment publication fueled renewed speculation when it reported that Mr Iger had discussed the possibility with Mr BloombergPeople who have discussed a possible presidential run with Mr Iger ld me that his discussion with Mr Bloomberg some years ago focused more on a possible run for mayor of New York City where Mr Iger has an apartment New York has long welcomed nonresident candidates like Mrs Clinn so Mr Igers California residency isnt seen as an obstacleBoth Mr Iger and Mr Bloomberg declined  commentWhether any of those jobs including the presidency would actually be better than being chief executive of Disney remains an open question After earlier announcing his retirement Mr Iger recently said he was willing  extend his contract which would eliminate the need for any highprofile exit strategy at least for the next few yearsCampaign butns emblazoned with Vote for Benioff and Marc Benioff for President circulated two years ago at Salesforces annual Dreamforce conference in San Francisco which draws hundreds of thousands of participants and has been viewed  some as a likely launching pad for any Benioff campaignLike Mr Schultz Mr Benioff has pursued an ambitious social and philanthropic agenda He started Pledge 1 the Salesforce model of donating 1 percent of their product 1 percent of their equity and 1 percent of employees time  help nonprofits achieve their missions  a practice that Salesforce says is now followed  1400 companies Mr Benioff was an outspoken defender of gay and lesbian rights and helped create a network of corporate leaders  oppose bills limiting LGBT rights in states like Indiana Georgia and North CarolinaMr Benioff 52 whose stake in Salesforce alone is worth over 3 billion and who has a net worth estimated  Forbes at over 4 billion has also written three books including the bestselling Behind the Cloud Still hes hardly a household name and is best known in business and technology circlesAsked for comment Mr Benioff said Business is the greatest platform for changeMs Sandbergs coming nationwide ur  promote the new book she coauthored Option B which describes coming  terms with her husbands sudden death in 2015 and other sries of coping with adversity has fueled speculation and possible wishful thinking that the book could be a springboard for a presidential campaignAs a billionaire 147 billion Forbes estimates and a key executive of the hugely successful Facebook Ms Sandberg already has enormous name recognition Her previous book Lean In was a bestseller and inspired a rallying cry for women She has worked in politics before as an assistant  the former Treasury secretary Lawrence H Summers and was a donor  Mrs Clinns campaign She was considered a candidate for a p post in any Clinn administrationMs Sandberg has denied any immediate presidential ambitions insisting that she loves her job at Facebook At age 47 shes under no pressure  run this election cycleWidespread reports that the Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg would run for president seem even more farfetched The speculation appears  have been set off  a Bloomberg News report that Mr Zuckerberg would retain voting control of Facebook even if he sold his shares and served in a government position for up  two years Mr Zuckerberg has denied any interest in runningThen theres Ms Winfrey 63 who for many Democrats might amount  the dream candidate She has unrivaled star power is an AfricanAmerican woman has run a successful business and has a fortune estimated  Forbes at 3 billionThats what I thought Ms Winfrey replied I thought Oh gee I dont have the experience I dont know enough And now Im thinking Oh OhBut when Mr Rubenstein began  ask As you consider whether you are going  run for president of the United States or not  she interjected No that wont be happeningWhile some may disparage Mr Trumps credentials for the presidency he did bring  his campaign a level of recognition that will be hard for other executives  replicate with the possible exception of Ms WinfreyTrump spent decades building his brand and his image as a successful businessman Mr Loeser said He was the star of one of the mostwatched television

around them but in politics youre out there dealing with reporters every dayLook at Rex Tillerson he added referring  the Exxon chief turned secretary of state Hes extremely well regarded in corporate

because they will Mr Loeser said Oprah is one of the most beloved people in America But has anyone gone through every minute and every hour of every show shes ever done  see if theres anything controversial Because someone willMr Gergen suggested that some chief executives might want  lower their sights I think business chief executives tend  make better governors or mayors he said They can

Stewart Patrick the direcr of the International Institutions and Global vernance Program at the Council on Foreign Relations elaborated on these trends in an emailThe most salient political division day is not between conservatives and liberals in the United States or social democrats in the United Kingdom and France but between nationalists and globalists The vicry of the Leave campaign in Britain the triumph of Trump and the unprecedented success of Marine Le Pens National Front albeit in a losing effort were underpinned  economic and cultural anxiety that transcended traditional ideological lines  and a rejection of conventional parties and a political establishment that had o long ignored those concernsTrump accelerated a realignment in the elecrate around racism across several different measures of racial animus  and that it helped him win By contrast we found little evidence  suggest individual economic distress benefited Trump The American political system is sorting so that racial progressivism and economic progressivism are aligned in the Democratic Party and racial conservatism and economic conservatism are aligned in the Republican PartyOn the surface the success of the British Labour Party in the elections two weeks ago would appear  stand apart But Labours gains were not based on improved margins in traditionally Labour leaning constituencies Corns Labour Party actually lost ground on its home turf but it more than made up for those setbacks  prevailing in Conservative constituenciesIn other words the Labour Party in England can no longer be considered a labor party in the traditional sense of representing the working class In this respect there is a growing demographic convergence between the Democratic Party the Labour Party in England Macrons En Marche in France the voters who elected Van der Bellen president of Austria and those who voted for the Peoples Party for Freedom and Democracy in the NetherlandsIn each of these plebiscites education emerged as the strongest predicr of votes for a right populist option where the less educated chose it more often than those with degreesAccording  Stewart Patrick of the Council on Foreign Relations globalization and the Great Recession of 20079 have resulted in a pervasive anxiety that providesfertile grounds for populists who promise a reassertion of control and national sovereignty including over borders as well as a renewed focus on those left behind in the global economyPatrick shares with a number of internationalists the hope that Macron and En Marche represent a viable political solution  contemporary conflicts that could be applied in other countriesMacrons genius has been  argue that he can thread the political needle  embracing globalization and reinforcing social protections  compensate those exposed  its downside In the process he has obliterated traditional parties of the left and the right while promising a synthesis tailor made for the twentyfirst century If he can bring it off he will become a model for other leaders  follow  including in the United StatesEven more striking among all voters Clinn won 5242 among the collegeeducated while Trump carried those without degrees 5144The ascendant militant wing  a colorful if controversial description of the SandersWarren wing of the party  has the moral high ground within Democratic ranks but the votes they want the party  seek are those of some of the least reachable constituencies  white men and women whose views on immigration race and political correctness are in direct conflict with liberal idealism It would be an extraordinary challenge  get these particular voters  join with minorities and progressive activistsLiberals must take seriously Americans yearning for social cohesion To promote both mass immigration and greater economic redistribution they must convince more nativeborn white Americans that immigrants will not weaken the bonds of national identityIn practical terms Beinart writes it means celebrating Americas diversity less and its unity moreThe hard partis backing ugh immigration enforcement so that path  citizenship doesnt become a magnet that entices more immigrants  enter the US illegallyBeinart cites Karen Stenners 2005 book The Authoritarian Dynamic in which she wroteExposure  difference talking about difference and applauding difference  the hallmarks of liberal democracy  are the surest ways  aggravate those who are innately inlerant and  guarantee the increased expression of their predispositions in manifestly inlerant attitudes and behaviors Paradoxically then it would seem that we can best limit inlerance of difference  parading talking about and applauding our samenessAmericans Beinart contendsknow that liberals celebrate diversity Theyre less sure that liberals celebrate unity And Obamas ability  effectively do the latter probably contributed  the fact that he  a black man with a Muslimsounding name  twice won a higher percentage of the white vote than did Hillary ClinnWhat we are seeing now is the replacement of classbased politics a trend apparent in the United States and Europe This gives us a more racialized and xenophobic politics on one hand and a politics capitalizing on increasing levels of education and openmindedness in the elecrate on the other If the building of a viable left coalition is possible it is likely  require some thoughtful and humane cooptation in the form of deference  our limits and boundariesCollapse,politics
At the same time thats not a complete pictureA 2013 study of red and blue America conducted well before the seismic events of the last two years sheds additional light on the Republican elecrate and provides a more complicated understanding of contemporary conservatismThe most conservative and most Republican of the three psychological regions  which Rentfrow labels Cluster 1 Friendly and Conventional  extends across the northern tier of the United States from Montana  Michigan down through the Midwest  almost all of the South for a tal of 26 states The accompanying map shows the region in shades of purpleRentfrow found that the Cluster 1 region isless affluent has fewer highly educated residents and is less innovative compared with states in the other regions States in this region also appeared  have higher levels of social capital and less social lerance compared with states in other regions Moreover friendly and conventional states were more politically conservative and Protestant compared with other regionsRentfrow and his coauthors write that the regionis defined  moderately high levels of extroversion agreeableness and conscientiousness moderately low neuroticism and very low opennessand thatthis configuration of traits portrays the sort of person who is sociable considerate dutiful and traditionalI asked a number of experts in political psychology what they thought about the Rentfrow paper and their answers ran the gamut from those who support a more empathetic portrayal of Republican voters  those who are adamant in their view that authoritarianism remains a dominant characteristic of those on the rightI started with Rentfrow himself My question went as followsSome research shows that Republicans and Trump voters in particular score high on measures of authoritarianism and on critical if not hostile views of AfricanAmericans and immigrants How does this fit with your finding that residents of the most Republican region are friendly sociable and considerateRentfrow replied thatindividuals high in authoritarianism score low in openness So in this sense the patterns of results we find at the regional level are consistentMany whites in the South he argued abide  an honor culture As longas everyone is respectful and abides  the social norms everyone is happy and agreeable But when threats are made against ones reputation or values acts of violence and physical aggression are considered appropriate forms of retribution In some ways the profile we observe uches on the surface of this profile  the friendly and considerate aspect when all is well But I think were now beginning  see more of the aggressive aspects I think many people perhaps especially in this region have begun  feel threatened  the changes taking place in society and are reacting with angerStenner explained this seeming contradiction  noting thatit is a lot easier  be generous and considerate and civicminded and invested in ones community if ones community is full of people much like oneself The kinds of behaviors we get out of authoritarians depend critically on how and where they have drawn the boundaries of us and them They can be very attentive  us but also tend  be very particular about whom us includesJohn Jost a professor of psychology and politics at NYU expands upon the implications of the word conscientiousness in describing red state votersConscientiousness is correlated with measures of racism sexism homophobia prejudice authoritarianism social dominance and system justification I suspect that this personality facr has more  do with a need for order or desire for rulefollowing which can easily take an authoritarian turn than other aspects of conscientiousness that we might associate with say honesty or integrityIn the opposite corner from Jost Marc Hetheringn a political scientist at Vanderbilt and a coauthor of the 2009 book Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics said he has abandoned use of the word authoritarian because he views it as excessively pejorative In place of authoritarian Hetheringn said he will now use the phrase fixed worldviewThe adherence  established traditions what scholars derisively call conventionalism is very much a characteristic of high conscientiousness Hetheringn wroteWhether you think this is good or bad probably depends on what you think of community norms In my view there is a lot of good  many of them Fixed worldview people want  protect themHetheringn added a cautionary noteHere is the problem though If you are perceived as outside that community the enforcement of those norms isnt going  feel very goodJonathan Haidt a social psychologist at NYUs Stern School of Business raised a crucial if obvious point Primary season Trump voters do not represent all Republican votersWe cant really know just on the basis of this paper whether these traits apply  Trump voters All we can know is that these traits are more common in states and regions that voted for Trump It is possible that the people who most show the positively valenced personality traits did not have Trump as their first choice in the primary but then once the general election came around most of them voted for the Republican candidate which is what partisans do in our two party system with very little party switchingMatt Motyl a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago argued in an email that in the general election thetypical Trump voter is not a raging screaming white nationalist the typical Trump voter is not much different from the typical Romney McCain or Bush voter They are just ordinary RepublicansThere is however a subset of Trump supporters who are extraordinarily vocal in their inlerance and white nationalism according  Motyl These activists have become the template of the stereotype of Trump voters he wrote As is the case for many stereotypes he added there is a grain of truth but the grain of truth is just that  a grainIn fact authoritarian voters with a sense of besieged white identity are more than a grain in the Republican elecrateAnd the clout of the authoritarian white identity wing of the Republican Party is such that Trump is governing  please this wing first and foremostFrom his apocalyptic threats  Kim Jongun  his call for the firing of protesting NFL players from his pardon of Joe Arpaio  his defense of proNazi protesters in Charlottesville Trump has remained the leader of hardright white AmericaThis strategy won him the presidency in 2016 when millions of nonauthoritarian white Republicans  sympathetic kind affectionate conscientiousness persevering thorough and reliable  made a pact with the devil and chose party loyalty over conscience Whos  say it

The relentless focus on the white working class in the aftermath of the election of President Trump has overshadowed a much larger bloc of voters the roughly 65 million service secr workers whose partisan loyalty is up for grabsThis immense and diverse employment secr is set  become a battleground in the struggle between Democrats and RepublicansMark Muro a Brookings senior fellow noted in an emailWhile the term service secr has become somewhat pejorative with its ambience of lousy locallytraded foodservice and maintenance jobsit also includesresearch services education services and professional services like consultingMuro sees potential for Democratic Party growth in the service secr arguing thatthe ongoing servitization of the economy is a big trend and it likely will benefit

Rotman School of Management University of Toron has conducted some of the most detailed analyses of employment secrsRepublicans dominate working class metros Florida noted in an email Democrats

Florida finds that this population currently splits its vote evenly between the two parties  no statistical significance for either Trump or Clinn According  Florida for Democrats  keep bemoaning the loss of the white working class may be a big mistakeFlorida argues that lowpaid service workers are the population that Democrats need  mobilize He suggests a far more targeted approachNot working class places The way  do this is with an aggressive inclusive growth agenda upgrade service jobs higher geographicallyindexed minimum wage better labor laws  protect service and caring work and jobs universal basic income affordable housing I could go on This is the new winning crossclass geographic coalitionPatrick Adler a docral candidate in urban planning at UCLA who collaborated with Florida on this research does not disagree but has some caveats He sent me data he compiled that suggests that lowpaid service workers are  no means guaranteed  become loyal Democrats Much depends on ethnic and other demographic characteristicsAdler analyzed 2016 voter information from 75 metropolitan areas with absolute majorities at least 50 percent of lowwage service workers  cities like Ocean City NJ Hot Springs Ark and Las VegasAdlers data shows that the strongest Clinn metro areas were 498 percent Latino while Trumps best metros were 87 percent Latino Clinn metros had four times the percentage of foreignborn voters at 20 percent as Trumps at 5 percentWhat stands out  me Adler wroteis that solidly Clinn service metros tend  be immigrant gateways like Miami McAllen and Orlando while solidly Trump service metros tend  be highly segregated ie blackwhite segregated Southern placesThe demographics of the proClinn metros point  additional problems facing Democrats who seek  build support among service workers The high levels of immigrant Latino and foreignborn voters in these communities means that it is more challenging  register and turn them outDemocrats however know that they need  get more votes from workers without college degrees and that their best opportunity  do so is among service workersFor example 77 percent of the 58 million employed in personal care and service occupations are women 72 percent of the 177 million people working in office and administrative support occupations are women and 756 percent of the 89 million in health care occupationsDemocratic operatives and union organizers are starting  mobilize lowerpaid service workers in preparation for the 2018 midterms and the 2020 presidential elections The Service Workers International Union is gearing up for a major political and union organizing campaign in the MidwestUnion officials estimate that there are 64 million workers across the country who make less than 15 an hourOnly half are

thatHillary Clinn didnt inspire anyone Why the hell stand in line if its just  vote for more of the sameStan Greenberg a Democratic pollster and strategist wrote me  email  say that he thinks Floridas analysis is very smart Greenberg like many pollsters had been broadly categorizing voters without college degrees as working class but recently he has begun  change the practiceFor the first time we are asking occupation  try  get at this  and so I think there really is potential for Democrats  gain here This is a real insight in what is possibleService industries are where the growth strategies of organized labor have been mostly focused for 40 years and where most of the growth has occurred While union membership has stagnated on the botm line at around 16 million over that span the composition of the 16 million changed dramatically millions of health care personal service education and government workers and some retail joining while roughly the same number in other secrs leavingRepublican leaders Booth argues are fully aware of the dangers of an organized and politically mobilized service secr The effort  strangle this opportunity has been the p strategic priority of the GOP since it gained power in the 2010 midterm elections he contended These efforts include state rightwork legislation ending aumatic deduction of union dues severe restrictions on the issues permitted at the bargaining table and other restraints on organized laborBooth notes that in 2014 Democrats and unions successfully backed ballot initiatives  raise the minimum wage in three red states Alaska Arkansas and South Dakota but little or none of the support spilled over  help Mark Pryor Mark Begich and Rick Weiland the losing Democratic Senate candidates in those statesOne key obstacle for Democrats seeking  recruit service workers is that such a mobilization would require stronger class appeals and less emphasis on identity politics than party leaders have been prepared  makeIf as my SEIU source says politics doesnt answer peoples problems then you are not going  get majorities willing  get in the fightSimilar tension has been a constant source of intraparty conflict dating back nearly 50 years  the 1968 presidential primary battle between Hubert Humphrey Eugene McCarthy and Robert F KennedyThe conflict will not be resolved  November 2018 But the ideas suggested

As far as anyone can tell Paul Ryan the speaker of the House  and the leader of whats left of the Republican establishment  isnt racist or authoritarian He is however doing all he can  make a racist authoritarian the most powerful man in the world Why Because then he could privatize Medicare and slash taxes on the wealthyAnd that in brief tells you what has happened  the Republican Party and  AmericaThis has been an election in which almost every week sees some longstanding norm in US political life get broken We now have a majorparty candidate who refuses  release his tax returns despite huge questions about his business dealings He constantly repeats claims that are tally false like his assertion that crime is at record highs its actually just a bit off hisric lows He stands condemned  his own words as a sexual predar And theres much much moreSo how did all our political norms get destroyed Hint It started long before Donald TrumpOn one side Republicans decided long ago that anything went in the effort  delegitimize and destroy Democrats Those of us old enough  remember the 1990s also remember the endless series of accusations hurled against the ClinnsNothing was o implausible  get on talk radio and get favorable mention in Congress and in conservative media Hillary killed Vince Foster Bill was a drug smugglerWhen Mrs Clinn famously spoke of a vast rightwing conspiracy out  undermine her husbands presidency she wasnt being hyperbolic she was simply describing the obvious realityAnd since accusations of Democratic scandal not  mention congressional investigations that started from a presumption of guilt had become the norm the very idea of bad behavior independent of politics disappeared The flip side of the obsessive pursuit of a Democratic president was utter refusal  investigate even the most obvious wrongdoing  Republicans in officeThe erosion of norms continued after President Obama ok office He faced tal obstruction at every turn blackmail over the debt ceiling and now a refusal even  hold hearings on his nominee  fill a vacancy on the Supreme CourtWhat was the purpose of this assault on the implicit rules and understandings that we need  make democracy work Well when Newt Gingrich shut down the government in 1995 he was trying  guess what privatize Medicare The rage against Bill Clinn partly reflected the fact that he raised taxes modestly on the wealthyIn other words Republican leaders have spent the past couple of decades doing exactly what the likes of Mr Ryan are doing now trashing democratic norms in pursuit of economic benefits for their donor classSo we shouldnt really be o surprised that Mr Comey who turns out  be a Republican first and a public servant well not so much decided  politically weaponize his position on the eve of the election thats what Republicans have been doing across the board And we shouldnt be surprised at all that Mr Trumps lurid personal failings havent caused a break with the leaders of his partys establishment They decided long ago that only Democrats have scandalsDespite Mr Comeys abuse of power Mrs Clinn will probably win But Republicans wont accept it When Mr Trump rages about a rigged election expect muted disagreement at best from a party establishment that in a fundamental sense never accepts the legitimacy of a Democrat in the White House And no matter what Mrs Clinn does the barrage of fake scandals will continue now with demands for impeachmentCan anything be done  limit the damage It would help if the media finally learned its lesson and spped treating Republican scandalmongering as genuine news And it would also help if Democrats won the Senate so that at least some governing could get doneCollapse,politics
Her company however was always a limited enterprise working for short periods of the year And unlike nearly every other artistic direcr day she demonstrated no interest in commissioning 21stcentury choreography Besides Balanchine the only choreographers she included were those who had made works for her as a dancer Jerome Robbins Maurice Bjart and Paul Mejia her former husbandThese Farrell dancers attached  companies from Arizona  Virginia came from varied backgrounds Most were American but the leading ballerinas Heather Ogden and Natalia Magnicaballi are Canadian and Argentine She released in them all a freedom of spirit a wealth of musical nuance and a range of physical inflection that kept her enterprise on the p level of achievement amid the worlds Balanchine diaspora Familiar ballets looked new rare ballets were reborn corps dancers made breakthroughs The companys final performances Dec 79 were no exceptionI returned  Washingn  meet Ms Farrell three days after the final performance Some of what she said Balanchine is my life  my destiny might look highflown on the page but was spoken simply almost with resignation She referred  her menr as Balanchine Mr Balanchine and sometimes Mr BMs Farrell 72 said she would continue teaching  she is a professor at Florida State University  but has no other plans as yet I live in the now Id dance forever if I could  theres nothing better She has two homes on an island in upstate New York Ive often taught a dance summer school there and an apartment here in WashingnShe likes  say she is a shy person who had  learn how  talk as an adult but she is eloquent Out of the blue she remarked I tell my dancers You have  change the molecular structure of the air  thats what dancing is about Below are edited excerpts from our conversationWith your company do you always teach the morning classEvery day Teaching extends my dance life I feel as if Im still the dancer I was I show my dancers a move and I think my legs way up there where it used  go Then I look in the mirrorClass is probably where Mr B learned about me You have  be there in the laborary where everybody is vulnerable Im sure Balanchine must often have looked at me and thought What does she think shes doing Thats not what I would have done But then he looked at what I did do And he worked with that I see that all the time in my dancers They do things in class or rehearsal that I didnt think Id asked for  and thats what I work withAs a dancer you made each performance a singular event Can this be passed onSome people go out there with an opinion and they dance an opinion But the musics never quite the same from one performance  the next you cant plan that in advance You must dance the choreography but you should recognize the different ways it can go You cant rehearse a performance What I rehearsed were options There are so many ways a performance can go your partner that night the music your security on point Dancing on point On that tiny part of your foot Its a precipiceDid you have stage frightWhen I was waiting in the wings Id be full of anticipation and quite anxious  but when I was out there onstage I was fine Not everything would go as I wanted but if I was off Id get back onAnd no audience is the same I tell my dancers If there are one thousand people in the house then you have  perform for each different person of the thousand You cant just perform for onethousandth of that audienceBut how do you dance differently for each member of the audienceYou dance in 360 degrees of space not just one People in the audience are sitting there and there and there  not all straight ahead of youIs there a common facr in these optionsIt has  be honest Words can misspeak and tell lies and errors The body cannot  not if youre an honest dancerYou were an ideal for many people  but not the only kind of ideal in Balanchines realmMr Balanchine was an observer and he loved the differences between people He liked  liken his dancers  animals Carol Sumner was a bird Some dancers were horses some thoroughbreds I was half cheetah half dolphin A cheetahs speed and its intelligence a dolphins fluencyYour season ended with the first ballet Balanchine choreographed in America SerenadeSerenade contains so much for me It has the first solo role I ever danced with the company They needed someone for the role known as the Dark Angel at short notice Mr B was asked who  cast I was in his line of vision He said Give it  her I had no stage rehearsal I was taught it very quicklyYou were away from New York City Ballet from 1969  1975 This season you presented Tzigane the first piece Balanchine made after your return  the fold Was it hard  regain your chemistry with himI suppose Mr Balanchine and I were both a little nervous So in our first Tzigane rehearsal we were both testing the waters He asked for something  mark one moment in the music I gave him a high penche arabesque leg extended high behind while the rso and head lean low He said Yes I know you can do that What else can you do So I turned over still on that one leg but now facing upward Then we both knew we were experimenting again I loved that We always undersod each others energyYour seasons have included a Balanchine Preservation Initiative reviving rarities you never danced How do you proceed with thoseWith those ballets nothing there is in my body So I have  check the videos and listen  the music But for that reason I dont have  unlearn anything My own body isnt involved But Ive had  learn each ballet inside outI dont stage ballets  showing the dancers a film of the ballet theyre going  learn Thats just one performance Its not the BibleCollapse,politics

Postmaterialism they write eventually became its own gravediggerThe rise of postmaterialism here and in Europe Inglehart and Norris arguebrought declining social class voting undermining the workingclassoriented Left parties that had implemented redistributive policies for most of the 20th century Moreover the new noneconomic issues introduced  Postmaterialists overshadowed the classic LeftRight economic issues drawing attention away from redistribution  cultural issues further paving the way for rising inequalityAs the Democratic Party in the United States and social democratic parties in Europe shifted their interest away from economic policies hardpressed members of the working and middle classes  suffering from stagnant or declining wages and lost jobs  led a backlash against the cultural changes linked with the rise of Postmaterialist and Selfexpression values Inglehart and Norris writeIn effect postwar prosperity in America and in Western Europe allowed many voters  shift their political priorities from breadandbutter issues  less materialistic concerns bringing greater emphasis on freedom of expression environmental protection gender equality and lerance of gays handicapped people and foreignersNot everyone experienced this newfound economic security however and the number of those left behind has grown steadily Those who do not experience the benefits of prosperity Inglehart and Norris write can see others  an influx of foreigners for example as the culprit causing their predicamentInsecurity encourages an authoritarian xenophobic reaction in which people close ranks behind strong leaders with strong ingroup solidarity rejection of outsiders and rigid conformity  group normsAccording  the two authorsThe proximate cause of the populist vote is anxiety that pervasive cultural changes and an influx of foreigners are eroding the cultural norms one knew since childhood The main common theme of populist authoritarian parties on both sides of the Atlantic is a reaction against immigration and cultural change Economic facrs such as income and unemployment rates are surprisingly weak predicrs of the populist voteIn addition  immigration issues related  race play a central roleLesseducated white Americans feel that they have become strangers in their own land They see themselves as victims of affirmative action and betrayed  linecutters  AfricanAmericans immigrants refugees and women  who jump ahead of them in the queue for the American dream They resent liberal intellectuals who tell them  feel sorry for the linecutters and dismiss them as bigots when they dontRelative  not absolute  economic insecurity plays a major role in the development of these attitudes Inglehart and Norris observeIt is clear that strong forces have been working  increase support for xenophobic parties This seems  reflect the fact that in recent decades a large share of the population of highincome countries has experienced declining real income declining job security and rising income inequality bringing growing insecurity In addition rich countries have experienced a large influx of immigrants and refugeesThey cite the example of Denmark before and after the financial collapse of 20089In 2004 before the crisis erupted the overtly antiMuslim Danish Peoples Party won 7 percent of the vote in 2014 it won 27 percent becoming Denmarks largest party In both years cultural backlash rather than economic deprivation was the strongest predicr of the vote for the Danish Peoples Party  but rising economic insecurity made people increasingly likely  vote for themunderstand why lowdensity white America turned out  support a populist leader with disturbingly illiberal tendenciesIn sections of the country undergoing sustained hardship  a result of aumation global trade and the residual effects of the 20079 recession  the march ward postmaterialist values has in Wilkinsons view come  a dead haltIn normal circumstances two fundamental shifts  from traditional and religious values  secular and rational values on one hand and from survival  selfexpressive values on the other  tend  move in the same direction over time Wilkinson writes In the United States they haventInstead he points out the United States has gone in two seemingly opposite directions over the past 15 years becoming significantly more secularrational while losing ground on selfexpressive valuesWhites living in low density exurban and rural areas are driving the shift back ward survival values Wilkinson arguesThe relative hardship experienced  many Trump supporters is reflected in a number of studiesTake just one measure For most Americans the most common form of wealth lies in the value of the homes people own Conversely those people who own homes valued below what they owe on their mortgages have more debt than wealth they are as the saying goes underwaterThis was especially true in the industrial Midwest where Monnat reportedTrump did better than Romney  an average of 167 percent in the highest mortality counties compared  81 percent in the lowest mortality countiesIts simple the working class  and even a significant part of the noncosmopolitan middle class that might vote for the Left  has always had a degree of cultural ethnic and nationalist feelings while the modern Left has bizarrely ejected all these things out of leftist politics and engaged in the deranged fantasy that these things dont matter at allThe result in LKs view is disastrousThe Left  as it currently exists with its xic obsession with internationalism multiculturalism and identity politics for everybody except the majority of people who might form its base  will simply die if it doesnt understand this believe that the American establishment was no longer reliably patriotic with patriotism defined as an instinctive loyalty  the wellbeing and values of Jacksonian AmericaWhile much of the elite with cosmopolitan sympathies see their main ethical imperative as working for the betterment of humanity in general according  Mead Trump supporters see the cosmopolitan elite as near treasonous  people who think it is morally questionable  put their own country and its citizens firstInglehart and Norris conclude their current essay on a modestly optimistic note suggesting the possibility that there might yet be an alliance between the populist right and the Democratic leftSo far emotionallycharged cultural issues cutting across economic lines have hindered the emergence of a new coalition But both the rise of populist movements and the growing concern for inequality reflect widespread dissatisfaction with existing political alignments In the long run a coalition based on the 99 percent is likely  emergeWilkinson does not share this outlookTo the extent that increasing economic security is liberalizing and stagnation and decline tend ward an illiberal zerosum survival mindset this amounts  a recipe for the political imposition of relatively illiberal policy on increasingly liberal and increasingly economically powerful cities This is not a stable situation and bodes ill for the future of American freedomIn practice Wilkinsons bleak prediction depends heavily on the success or failure of President Trumps attempts  undermine the pillars of democratic government the system of checks and balances the rule of law and the watchdog role of the mediaTrump is betting that his flamboyant strategy will take him through his first term and beyond As atrocious as it is who can blame

On SoccerLIVERPOOL England  Josep Maria Barmeu the president of Barcelona preferred  focus on what he had gained rather than what he had lostWe have earned 105 million or about 127 million he said and there is more  invest in football in assets Lets see what we doAlmost exactly five months later the watching world now has an answer What Barcelona has done with all of that money all of that opportunity is sign Ousmane Dembl a 20yearold French winger of bright promise for an initial 126 million and allocate even more  upward of 175 million the secondhighest fee in hisry   the transfer of Philippe Coutinho Liverpools Brazilian playmakerBut the when is still uncertain Jamie Carragher the former Liverpool defender might be expected  feel his former club should keep hold of one of its crown jewels until the end of the season The best thing for Liverpool  do he wrote on Twitter this week is  agree on a BIG fee for Coutinho  leave during the summer warning that Liverpools place in the p four would be seriously risked if he departed this monthFrom the players perspective while it is a move he has long craved the timing is less than ideal Such a drastic change of scenery in a season that leads in a World Cup carries a little more risk than a key figure in Brazils plans might like even if escaping the brute physicality of the Premier League might be an attractionThat is not  say there is no logic  it Allowing Coutinho  earmarked as a longterm replacement for Andrs Iniesta  a sixmonth period  settle in would allow Barcelona  see him flourish more fully next season More immediately a move now also might ease the domestic workload on the 33yearold Iniesta meaning the teams coach Ernes Valverde could reserve him for Champions League adventuresFar more important than when however is why As recently as September Barcelonas direcr of professional sports Albert Soler claimed the Neymarinspired hyperinflation of Europes already superheated transfer market was a model of football we are not used  and insisted that Barcelona wont get involved in thatYet whenever Coutinho joins Barcelona will possess two of the most expensive players of all time PSG and Manchester City might have started the fire but Barcelona is happily fanning the flames and it is doing so at a time when the club most at risk of being burned is Barcelona itselfIt is now almost a decade since Pep Guardiola ok charge of the team that would change soccer In the summer of 2008 Guardiola was promoted from manager of Barcelonas B team after only one season and handed the reins of a senior side that included Lionel Messi Gerard Piqu Iniesta Xavi Hernndez and soon Sergio BusquetsXavi  now in lucrative semiretirement in Qatar  apart the spine of that team remains in place It has been graceful  watch  Barcelona always is  but it is an aging team its beauty slowly dimming its glory gradually fading Busquets is a comparative spring chicken as is Ivan Rakitic both 29 Messi Piqu Iniesta and Javier Mascherano are all the wrong side of 30They are still expensive though Last year Barcelona announced record revenues of 854 million when its chief executive Oscar Grau boasted that even teams in the NFL and NBA did not make that much moneyThe clubs salary bill accounted for an eyewatering 63 percent of that clubs are recommended  spend no more than 70 percent of turnover on salaries even before a spate of renewals  including that of Messi  are taken in account Barcelonas squad is the highestpaid in all of soccer more than Real Madrid more than Manchester City more than PSGBarcelona is adamant it can afford it though its existence is perhaps a little more handmouth than the scale of its wealth might suggest Barcelona projects its revenues will increase again this year breaking the 900 million mark but then they will have  if the club is  keep pace with its rapidly inflating salariesWhen PSG deposited the 267 million check  cover Neymars buyout clause Barcelona had a chance  break that cycle As Barmeu said it was an opportunity and a golden oneFor years Barcelona has recruited desperately poorly It is a club that the worlds finest players would do almost anything  join  as Coutinho and Luis Surez before him prove  and yet its approach  acquisitions is haphazard and chaoticLast summer what was supposed  be a move for PSGs Marco Verratti somehow became the sale of Neymar A deal for Nices Ivorian midfielder Jean Michael Seri collapsed amid rumors that talks had only begun because Barcelona fans kept mentioning his name Liverpool held firm on CoutinhoLast month Atltico Madrid threatened  complain  FIFA about Barcelonas pursuit of Anine Griezmann The club might have added Dembl and Nlson Semedo last summer two bright young things but a midfield in desperate need of rejuvenation was bolstered only  Paulinho 29 signed from Chinas Guangzhou EvergrandeThe current league standings might not suggest it but Real Madrid has its future in hand Barcelona remains locked  its past seemingly unable  think about replacing the players that have brought so much success Barmeu has talked about reenergizing the production line of young talent from La Masia its famed academy but that seems more a pipe dream than a planFive months ago Barcelona had a fortune with which  rebuild itself Whenever Coutinho arrives most of that money will be gone And yet the problems the issues it has refused  confront for so long will remainCollapse,sports

Most children who play team sports will not win a college scholarship But that doesnt mean that we cant learn something from collegiate coaches who spend countless hours evaluating high school athletes on and off the field As it turns out the advice head coaches have for prospective recruits will help any student succeed even those who dont plan  play sports in collegeWe spoke with several college coaches from a variety of sports about the qualities they look for in a student as they try  build a successful team Here are edited excerpts of what they had  sayNick Saban head football coach at the University of AlabamaI tell my players  focus on what you have  do  succeed rather than the result itself This is true if you want  climb Mount Everest be the president of IBM or play for Alabama I ask them what are your goals what do you hope  accomplish and how is your behavior now helping you accomplish those goals Whether we win or lose there are technical aspects for every player things that they did well and things that they did poorly My focus is on improvement One game doesnt define success  its momentary Its about consistency and performanceI always talked  my own kids after their games and looked for the life lessons that came from the things they did or other things that happened in the game As a parent you can have these discussions or leave it  the coach I think sometimes you need  prepare your child  respond  adversity If I want  play more then I need  work harder Everyone is not entitled  an opportunity  play Thats not the way of the world You have  earn your wayThink of college as a 40year decision not a fouryear one The life lessons learned at that institution will affect them foreverGene McCabe head coach of mens lacrosse at Washingn and Lee UniversityWe all think our kids are the greatest but what is the reality If your child is talented and loves it be sure  provide them with competitive opportunities  grow their game and  gain exposure but keep it in perspectiveCandidly I worry about the money that is spent day on competitive youth sports While families do need  engage in the process and attend urnaments and showcases they do not need  do it all the time nor should they take out a second mortgage on the house  pay for itI always find it interesting  get a voicemail from a parent saying that their son is so busy that he cant call me himself Until that kid picks up the phone I assume they are not interested When you see a kid who has taken ownership of the process it tells you that  and large they will take ownership of other things in their lives oAudra Smith head coach of womens basketball at Clemson UniversityThe kind of athlete Im looking for is one who can handle adversity Today a lot of parents walk around with a safety net so their children wont get hurt or disappointed  but I want a ugh player who understands that when I push them its not personal its because I know they have the ability  be better We need  help our children develop a little ughness so that when they experience ughness down the road they dont shut down or shatter emotionallyParents should look for a good youth coach who demands the best of their kids but is not over the p  Find a coach who fits your childs personality and who you feel comfortable with as a parent So when your child says the coach is being ugh you can back up that coach and agree that maybe your child isnt playing up  his or her potential Thats what I tell my own daughter when shes disappointed after a game Parents need  uphold a coachs authority not undermine itThere are kids I dont recruit because I see their social media When I see an inappropriate post like provocative pictures or inappropriate language its a red flag It not only tells me about the player it also tells me that their parents are obviously not aware of whats going on in their teens world and I dont feel like Im going  have that backing from a parent if I have an issue with that childJeremy Gunn head coach of mens soccer at Stanford UniversityThe biggest asset I look for on the field past athleticism and skill is intrinsic drive The most successful student athletes that I have coached are the ones that first minute or last minute winning or losing hot day or cold day cup final or easier game show the same type of attitude If somebody has that drive and work ethic they will continuously grow and develop As a coach you are not really recruiting the student athlete for day you are recruiting who they are going  become and who you think they can beEverybody has moments when theyre upset and not happy with an outcome As a parent you can either join in the complaining process or sensibly say  your kids What do you think you can do about it Or what can you do next time When a child complains about their coach you can either join in with the process or you can say Have you spoken  your coach about this  help guide them  take control of their situationBeing successful requires the same traits no matter what you do If somebody is a good student they have already shown perseverance and a desire  succeed That means theyve already learned certain skills that are going  make them a good athlete for us I talk  our student athletes about Dr Carol Dwecks work on the growth mindset and explain that those are the types of people who are the foundations of our program People who have been extremely successful have often been reinforced with the fixed idea that they are good and they are special Then when they move up the levels I think a great university can sometimes take a huge sledgehammer and smash their ego  smithereens Now they are no longer p of the heap They are no longer the superstar athlete Based on the fixed reinforcement theyve had their whole life it logically follows that they are now bad and they are no good So  educating people that it is a continuous journey theyre able  handle the situation in a more positive mannerLisa Miller head coach of womens lacrosse at Harvard UniversityWe look for athletes who are also serious students ones who are challenging themselves in the classroom  taking ugh courses and doing well in themWith travel leagues parents should ask themselves What will my child be missing  not playing for our wns team or for their high school While the players on travel teams are all close in age in high school a freshman may be playing with a senior and vice versa Kids learn social skills when they have  play with people of different ages and levels Upperclassmen are learning  be leaders and freshmen are learning  be part of a teams culture These are skills that kids need  play at the college level and later on in the workplaceTo play at an elite level youre going  have  play at the club level But you dont have  be on the road every weekend so that youre missing family vacations not forming friendships with the kids in the neighborhood or giving up a chance  play another sportNinety percent of our athletes played multiple sports in high school Multisport play reduces overuse injuries and exercises different muscles  but theres also a learning benefit You might be the star lacrosse player but when it comes  basketball you may be on the bench for most of the game Its a good learning experience for a kid  have  sit on the bench It puts them in another persons shoes and teaches them empathy which will make them a better leader and teammateTracey Bartholomew head coach of womens soccer at Columbia UniversityI think one of the things that kids dont handle well is constructive criticism They dont know how  process it when theyre hearing things that arent praiseworthy all the time You want parents  be encouraging but also not afraid  give constructive criticism A coachable kid who can handle constructive criticism  that goes a long wayAs children get older its important  teach them how  selfreflect Instead of giving your opinion right away ask them what they thought about the game If theyre o hard on themselves sp them and say here are two or three things you did well and heres the thing youll need  work on for next time Help them learn  process itWe vet players  talking  their club coaches I want  know Is this the kid who after practice is  themselves wearing their headphones walking quickly off the field Or is this the kid who picks up the cones and the pinnies and helps out I want the kid who picks up the cones who has that awareness of other people In developing a team I look for people who are not selfish I honestly would take A or B level

The NFL said Thursday that the number of concussions had fallen 113 percent this season compared with last seasons record high as more players reported suspected head injuries and medical spotters at games pulled more athletes aside for examinationThe league has for years tried  reduce concussions  introducing an array of measures such as altering kickoffs limiting the number of fullcontact practices and adding extra medical personnel at games Yet in the five years since statistics on concussions have been published the decline has been more modest 65 percent  244 concussions this season from 261 in 2012 The leagues numbers encompass concussions sustained during practices and games from the preseason and the regular seasonOn a conference call with reporters a panel of medical experts who work with the league said they were heartened  the declines but they acknowledged that more work was needed  reduce further the number of concussionsI was encouraged that the numbers are down but Im still far from satisfied said Dr Mitchel S Berger a member of the NFLs head neck and spine committee As a health care provider I think one of our absolute highest priorities is  get these numbers further downThe league said that since it began releasing concussion statistics the number of concussions in preseason practices had declined the most while the number in games had declined only marginallyThe league said some of its initiatives had helped account for the biggest declines like the limits on the number of fullcontact practices that were introduced in the latest labor deal in 2011 The number of concussions in practices in the preseason when players on expanded rosters are fighting for jobs fell  26 this season from 42 in 2012But the league has had a harder time explaining why the number of concussions over all has not changed as drastically The number of concussions in preseason games for instance rose  45 from 43 five years agoPart of the problem facing the league is identifying concussions in real time In theory a decline in concussions can mean that fewer players are being concussed or that fewer players are stepping forward  admit they have been Some players who selfreport an injury might also turn out not  be concussedWilliam B Barr the direcr of the neuropsychology division at the NYU School of Medicine and a former neuropsychology consultant for the Jets said that the increased scrutiny on concussions should lead  a longterm increase in the number of reported casesWhat this tells me that you would expect them  report more and theyre not he said I dont see these numbers as significantly different from previous numbersThe league also admitted that its concussion procols which it has enhanced several times have flaws On Wednesday the league said that the Miami Dolphins medical staff did not follow the concussion procol in a playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Jan 8According  the league the Dolphins team docr ok appropriate steps  consult with the independent neurologist on the sideline and  review video of the play The league said that Moore did not demonstrate any concussion sympms either during or at any time following the gameThe Dolphins docr and the independent sideline docr however did not recognize that Moore was bleeding from the mouth and let him return  the gameCollapse,sports

PHILADELPHIA  When T J McConnell a reserve guard for the Philadelphia 76ers was married last summer his brother and best friend surprised him at the end of the reception The funky beat of a familiar song filled the room as the dance floor flooded with friends and familyMcConnell knew the lyrics  heartHere they come PhiladelphiaOn the run stand up and cheerNo 1 PhiladelphiaHere they come team of the yearEveryone went nuts McConnell saidThe song was Here Come the Sixers a discoflavored anthem from 1975 that has become the soundtrack for the NBAs most precocious team The 76ers are so young they might as well take a school bus  their games But they commemorate their vicries  dancing  a song that practically struts down the street in bellbotms while shaking a tambourineIts very strange said Terry Rocap 70 a musician who performed on the original recording But its a good tune People seem  like itThe 76ers under the direction of Scott ONeil their chief executive have been dipping in the franchises past even as the team reinvents itself Chris Heck their president for business operations cited the teams new slate of uniforms which quilt gether several eras Theres Phila lettering from 1960 stars from the 1970s and a collar taken from the jerseys worn  the 76ers during the 198283 season when they last won an NBA championshipWhen Scott came in about five years ago we got gether and said We need  start bringing back what was great about the Sixers Heck said Because the heritage is amazingThat heritage also includes Here Come the Sixers which ONeil hoped  incorporate in recent seasons as a regular part of the gamenight experience But Heck said the rest of the staff voted  reserve it for home wins which meant that nobody got  hear it much at all The Sixers were 1072 just two seasons agoBut successstarved fans of the team are optimistic The 76ers employ several young players who are actually decent at basketball And despite some recent growing pains they should contend this season for their first playoff berth since 2012 Vicries are hardearned though and Here Come the Sixers is still something of a rare treatScotts always like I want  hear it more Heck said And were like We love it o But we have  stay disciplinedThe song urges fans  clap your hands and smp your feet in support of the team of the year which is of course the 76ers For the musicians behind the song its renaissance has been a pleasant surpriseWe figured the song would just be a fleeting moment of glory said Randy Childress 68 who played bass guitar on the song But now its going  be on my epitaphAt the time of the songs creation Childress was doing odd jobs for the 76ers while he finished his degree at Temple He recalled that he once earned 500 for dressing up as a turkey at a game before Thanksgiving A pair of female ushers clad in pilgrim costumes led him aroundI did all sorts of stupid stuff he saidAs for the team itself the 76ers were on the rise after years of yawninducing mediocrity But Pat Williams then the general manager undersod the 76ers needed  add some pep  the gameday experience if they were  draw larger crowds  the Spectrum the teams arena at the timeWe were trying  create the kind of atmosphere where it was a fun place  come he said in a telephone interviewSo when Williams learned that Childress was in a rock band he had an idea Perhaps the 76ers needed their own theme songArmed with a new assignment Childress invited Rocap and a third bandmate named Joe Sherwood  his small apartment where he had a fourtrack machine They hammered out a demo the original beat set  the steady dribble of a basketballBoink boink boink boink Childress saidOne morning after watching Sesame Street with his 7yearold daughter Rocap arrived with lyricsOne two threefourfive SixersTen nine eight 76ersAnd were going Oh thats great Childress said So thats where the initial burst came from and then we built the whole song around itThe band known as Fresh Aire wrote the song in E major a key at the p of the vocal range for most male tenors By pushing that range Sherwood said the song created energy And in hopes of protecting its shelf life over the years the band kept the lyrics free of references  specific players on the team  even the illustrious Julius ErvingOn the track the band harmonizes  an accompaniment that includes guitars piano bass and drums Sherwoods brother Richard gave the song some soul  jamming out on a Hohner Clavinet a keyboard instrument at the height of cool in the 1970s thanks  Stevie WonderMy brother added a little riff said Joe Sherwood 70 who began singing Here they come Deedley deedley deeeeeWilliams the Sixers general manager appreciated how the song turned out  it was exactly what he wanted he said  but the team kept its rollout subtleIt really wasnt a big deal Sherwood said There wasnt any big hoopla or major announcement They just started playing itWorld B Free 64 a former guard who now works as an ambassador for the team was a firstyear player when the song made its debut Before home games the songs first few beats would reach the players as they ok the floor It became an even bigger deal once Erving known as Dr J joined the team the next seasonWed be coming out of the tunnel and the crowd would be getting juiced up Free said And then Doc would come out there with that big ol Afro and start throwing it down BoomFor better or for worse the song has stuck with Free through the decadesI hear it in my sleep he saidIn the wake of Here Come the Sixers other teams reached out  the band  write their theme songs including one for the NHLs Washingn Capitals called Clap for the Caps But none of them had much staying power And when Williams left the 76ers organization in 1986 the song more or less left with himBut it had a good run Williams saidChildress Rocap and Sherwood meanwhile spent several years uring and playing at clubs Sherwood eventually started a recruiting business Rocap became a professional window washer Childress who had studied architecture began designing exhibits for trade shows and museumsThe Sixers theme song was largely forgotten until the early 2000s when it was resuscitated  Angelo Cataldi a longtime host for Sports Radio 94WIP in PhiladelphiaWe were really excited about the team and we needed a song Cataldi said So we did some research and we found out there was really only one and it was this 70s disco thing and it was dated and absurd But thats kind of our showCataldi now regrets the part he played in keeping Here Come the Sixers alive  its not his favorite song he said  but many others seem  have a more favorable opinionLast season Joel Embiid the teams effervescent center celebrated a win against the Knicks  dancing  the song with several cheerleaders Some of his teammates are similarly enchanted  itI actually play it all the time said McConnell the 76ers guard My friends will be like Let me hear the song And Ill put it onWhen Williams now senior vice president for the Orlando Magic delivered the keynote address at a prayer breakfast in Ocber he was surprised  the entertainment a rendition of Here Come the Sixers performed  Childress and RocapI sat there listening and I couldnt believe what was happening Williams said These 700 people were carrying on like it was a Billy Graham crusadeWilliams said the reason for the songs popularity was no secretEverybody likes  tap their es and clap their hands Williams said Winning helps oCollapse,sports

Common SenseAt age 67 Thomas C Davis should be enjoying all the perks of a long and distinguished career at the pinnacle of Wall Street and the Texas business elite These include golfing at the prestigious Dallas Country Club and Presn Trail lf Club where he was a member trips  Las Vegas and golf urnaments on the private jet he coowned and fractional ownership of two professional sports teams the Texas Rangers and the Dallas StarsWhat he faces instead is the prospect of 20 years or more in federal prison and millions of dollars in finesLast month Mr Davis pleaded guilty  12 felonies for a brazen insider trading scheme in which he leaked a stream of confidential information about the Dallasbased Dean Foods while he served as the companys chairmanWhen questioned  agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission last year he lied compounding his securities fraud  committing perjury And after the FBI agents left he ok a prepaid cellular phone he had used  leak the information and threw it in a creek near his Dallas home destroying evidence and obstructing justiceMr Daviss crimes have received relatively little attention in part because of the blaze of publicity that accompanied the flamboyant professional sports gambler William T Walters who was accused of being his coconspirar and the threetime Masters golf champion Phil Mickelson Mr Mickelson wasnt charged but netted nearly 1 million from the Dean Foods tips and agreed  forfeit the proceeds plus interestMr Walters pleaded not guilty last week  10 felony countsWhat led  Mr Daviss actions His plea hearing coupled with the SEC and criminal complaints and interviews with people who know him offer some cluesFor one thing Mr Davis was so desperate for money he even ok from a charity According  the SEC Mr Davis ran a charity that raised money for a Dallas shelter for battered women and children The charity tax records show was Shelter lf Inc which held an annual oneday proam golf urnament at Presn Trail  benefit Genesis Womens Shelter  Support The event typically raised over 400000 and after expenses contributed about 300000 a year  GenesisMr Davis was a copresident and trustee of Shelter lf the golf legend Lanny Wadkins was one of five other trustees According  the SEC in August 2011 Mr Davis ld his assistant  write him a check for 100000 on the charitys account which he then used  cover an overdraft in his personal checking account of 80000This 100000 check resulted in a significant shortfall in the amount available for donation  the battered womens shelter the SEC said in its complaint Davis first delayed the charitys donation  the shelter and later wrote a check for a partial amount only after prompting  the shelter leader and promising another 100000  the end of the shelters fiscal yearMr Davis eventually repaid the 100000 using money he had obtained as part of the insider trading schemeMany of his former colleagues on Wall Street were stunned  the charges against the distinguished whitehaired Mr Davis a Harvard Business School graduate and a Navy veteran who in contrast  Mr Walters and Mr Mickelson both known gamblers was seen as a pillar of the business establishmentIn addition  his long tenure on the Dean Foods board culminating in being named chairman in 2013 Mr Davis served on at least nine other corporate boards including Trin Energy Suiza Foods and the Dallasbased Colonial Bank now owned  BBT Financial He was chief executive of the Concorde Group and a founder of Bluffview Capital both investment firmsBefore that he was a managing partner at Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette where he was head of banking and corporate finance for the southwestern United States and handled many mergers and acquisitions He left after Credit Suisse acquired the firm in 2001He of all people should have known betterBut the annals of insider trading are filled with people who knew better from Ivan Boesky  Rajat Gupta Whats perplexing is their motives Like Mr Davis they were already rich and successful beyond most peoples dreamsAt his plea hearing last month Mr Davis said he knew that his actions were wrong and unlawful but otherwise shed little light on why he turned  insider trading But clearly he needed money despite his years of bonuses as a highly paid investment banker and his lucrative direcrs feesAccording  the SECs complaint  April 2010 Mr Davis was in desperate financial straits He owed the IRS 78000 His brokerage account was heavily margined and he had run up tens of thousands in credit card debt He owed 550000  one of his investment fundsMr Davis sought salvation in gambling and in Mr Walters whom he met decades earlier on a golf course The two often played gether especially when they were both living in Southern California The insider trading scheme began around June 2008 when Mr Davis tipped Mr Walters  Dean Foods coming earningsIt isnt clear who came up with the idea but Mr Walters an active invesr often expressed an interest in how Dean Foods was doing There was no explicit agreement for Mr Davis  share in any proceeds from Mr Walterss trading Rather as Mr Davis put it at his plea hearing I expected that I would receive personal benefits in the form of business opportunities and a potential source of capitalAs Professor Coffee put it This is a perfect example of a favor bank which is exactly how Wall Street worksHowever vague the terms of their deal they clearly knew that what they were doing was wrong Mr Walters gave Mr Davis a prepaid cellular phone for use when conveying inside information and ld him  use the code Dallas Cowboys when referring  Dean Foods the government assertedMr Davis finally came knocking in April 2010 when he met with Mr Walters in Las Vegas and asked for money Mr Walters arranged a loan of 625000 which solved the immediate demands of the IRS and his investment firmBut his spending continued In just one month March 2011 Mr Davis ran up gambling losses of 200000 at one Las Vegas casino He owed 178000 for the private jet And he had  cover the 100000 he had taken from the charity The overdraft had occurred when the casino cashed in his markers after Mr Davis failed  make good on the gambling lossesThis time Mr Walters guaranteed a 400000 line of credit for Mr Davis who promptly drew down 350000 of it And Mr Davis repaid Mr Walterss 625000 loan with interestMr Davis ultimately received over 1 million in loans from Mr Walters most never repaid As it turned out that was a pittance compared  the 43 million in profit Mr Walters reportedly reaped from Mr Daviss tips  a sum Mr Davis learned of only in the course of the investigation Despite Mr Daviss reputation as a skilled deal maker that will surely rank as one of the worst insider trading deals in hisry and it may help explain why Mr Davis is now cooperating with the government against Mr WaltersA lawyer for Mr Davis Thomas M Melsheimer at Fish  Richardson in Dallas declined  commentThe government has shed little light on Mr Daviss motive other than that he needed money The SEC said he did little  adjust his expensive lifestyle after leaving Credit Suisse in 2001 He experienced a sharp drop in his income went through an expensive divorce soon after and suffered big investment reversals during the 2008 financial crisisNone of that is a crime Mr Davis is hardly alone in trying  maintain the illusion of wealth and prosperity even as his personal finances veered out of controlBut after a lifetime of success Mr Davis was o proud and o embarrassed  admit any of this and turn  his wealthy friends and fellow golf club members though many would have been willing  help according  a person close  him This person and others insisted on anonymity because the situation involved a pending criminal matterSome people would risk anything rather than suffer that kind of personal embarrassment Professor

ATLANTA  Drew Speraw a Kansas State assistant coach found himself in an unenviable position near the end of the Wildcats tight win over the University of Maryland Baltimore County last Sunday He had  physically grab his bossBruce Weber Kansas States head coach is a defensefirst guy In the second half while his team was on defense against UMBC the action was on the other end of the court from the Kansas State bench As Weber yelled instructions and imprecations  his players over the noise of the crowd he inched closer and closer  midcourt like a salmon traveling upstream in spurts and like plenty of other coaches even wandered on the court itself sometimesThose are nonos in college basketball grounds for a technical foul which is a terrible thing during a close game Just ask Kentucky Coach John Calipari who got whistled for drifting beyond the coachs box in his teams loss  Kansas State Thursday nightIn Kansas States game last weekend Weber had already been warned Fortunately Speraw is used  it and he knows the responsibility that goes with his position  Weber on the benchIm the closest one Speraw said after Sundays game in Charlotte NCOn Wednesday Weber said that while he is a frequent migrant down the sideline one boundary is clearMy thing is if you yell at the refs you should get a technical he saidBut he defended his intention  leading his team  vicry  and actions  shouting pacing pushing the limits of the coachs boxIf were coaching our guys he said thats what were paid  doThe NCAA doesnt necessarily disagree This is the first season of an expanded coachs box which is the area the head coach may patrol during play Vigorous sideline generals received an extra 10 feet this season they may now roam from the baseline all the way  a mark 38 feet away Thats a midrange jump shot from midcourt which is 47 feet from the baselineI have had officials tell me that it was expanded for me Weber saidCollege basketball coaches are easy subjects for ridicule NBA fans scoff at their hyperactivity and point  professional coaches comparatively calm mien even though NBA coaches may stray as much as 43 feet from the baseline Casual observers wonder why these blustering nattily dressed bombasts cant stay coolThe college coaches say they deserve sympathy Their charges are younger than most players in the NBA Their teams can feel especially far away while on defense seeking crucial lategame sps out of vocal range for even the loudest coach Most coaches are former players with decades of experience who now watch mostly helplessly as postadolescents try  implement months of training in a few essential seconds Their antics also make for great TVYet they have  stay inside an invisible box during games or risk a penalty that could tangibly hurt their team The correct call for a coachs box violation after a warning is a Class B technical foul giving the other team one free throw and the ball inbounded where it was when the foul was calledI have a young team and sometimes they dont talk Alabama Coach Avery Johnson said last week between first and secondround games You can hear it in my voice Ive got  talk for them I got warned yesterday and probably going  get warned morrowDespite plenty of yelling and straying Johnson and Alabama lost  Duke on Sunday nightIn a world where referees Tup coaches for far more subjectively determined violations there is an argument that the coachs box is extraneous even condescending Anecdotally there appear  be few Ts actually called the NCAA said it did not keep the statistic Kansas Coach Bill Self complained that he had been whistled once this year for sticking my e two inches outside the boxWe represent universities South Carolina Coach Frank Martin said in a phone interview Were grown men Were employed We get treated like were immature Weve got  be in this small little confined area Were not going  go  the other bench and instigate somethingThis understanding was partly why the box was expanded according  Art Hyland secretaryrules edir of the NCAA mens basketball rules committee It is also why referees are instructed  first give the bench a warningPeople felt empathy that the coaches really needed a little more room in order  do their job correctly Hyland saidAn extra 10 feet turns out  be a lot Self said Thursday in Omaha before the Jayhawks round of 16 game He thought it was a pretty insignificant change when it was announced last June but now that it has been in place for a season he said Its been a great ruleYou feel like you can actually have a little bit more communication on the other end of the floor he saidOn Wednesday before Thursday nights violation Calipari blamed the tight strictures of the old box for one of the most infamous coachs box technical fouls in the college gameAt the Spectrum where they had all those lines Calipari said Im standing there and the guy calls a T from 90 feet away Youre out of the box And I really wasnt out of the box but it looked like itCalipari had no such defense or excuse Thursday nightIn practice there is frequently a liveandletlive dynamic between referees and hyperactive coaches Warnings are issued actual fouls less soEd Highwer a retired referee said officials often find that assistant coaches are better interlocurs for conveying the warnings Speraw Webers assistant said that the referees had spoken  the staff at halftime of the UMBC gameWhen warning coaches that they were in danger of violating this rule Highwer said he would often say You dont want  make me do something I dont want  doNinety percent of the time I would say the coaches are just so caught up in the moment coaching their kids Highwer said Its an emotional sportCollapse,sports
ORLANDO Fla  The NFL believes it has finally figured out one of the most basic aspects of football what is a catchIn hopes of clarifying what has consistently been one of its most frustrating onfield issues the league announced on Tuesday that as part of several adopted proposals from the leagues competition committee it had redefined and hopefully simplified what constitutes a catch But the door was certainly left open for future debateIn the simplest terms a player has  catch the ball land in bounds and then do something that demonstrates he has control of the ballThe new definition is similar in spirit  what was previously on the books but both the main rule and its attached notes were rewritten significantly in hopes of clarifying things for players officials and fans The terminology now states that a catch will have occurred if a player who is in boundsa secures control of the ball in his hands or arms before the ball uches the ground andb uches the ground inbounds with both feet or with any part of his body other than his hands andc after a and b have been fulfilled performs any act common  the game eg tucks the ball away extends it ward or over the goal line or the firstdown line takes an additional step turns upfield or avoids or wards off an opponent or maintains control of the ball long enough  do soThe NFL removed the stipulation that a player who has satisfied those three criteria must also survive going  the ground with the ball A player will only have  survive the ground if he has yet  satisfy category cJames who still believes his catch should have been a uchdown said the changes should help the game be called more consistentlyThe sticking point though regardless of how many spectacular uchdowns are preserved could prove  be the issue of fumbles The going  the ground language was introduced  the NFL rule book in 1982 with the goal of eliminating what had become a disturbing trend of fumbles at the end of catches and this weeks change could inadvertently bring that problem back in full forceAt a news conference on Monday announcing the proposed changes Al Riveron the NFLs senior vice president of officiating acknowledged that significantly changing the going  the ground language would most likely mean an uptick in fumbles but he said that fan pressure was involved in the decision makingAre we going  see more fumbles Maybe Riveron said We want  make these catches catches Thats what the fans wantRich McKay the president of the Atlanta Falcons said that he would trade 10 more fumbles for five more memorable catches and that the leagues hisry of tweaking the catch rule had led  far o much confusion necessitating a tal overhaul of how catches are handledWe needed  start over he said It got  us we need  get objective standardsRiveron and McKay acknowledged that it was Bryants overturned catch that started the debate leaguewide but the volume was turned up after Commissioner Roger odell vowed  fix thingsI think we can clarify this rule odell said at his annual news conference before the Super Bowl With a lot of hard work focus get  a place where  Im not going  say there wont be controversy  but we can get  a better place We have a great opportunity  get this thing rightOwners said they would still brace for controversial calls but predicted there would be fewer of themThis rule change is not gonna solve every single issue youre still going  have a certain amount of subjectivity said John Mara the president of the GiantsThe league also changed language  try  curb dangerous hits that make use of a players helmet altering the rule book in two places Under the section on unnecessary roughness it removes the necessity that contact with a helmet be initiated violently or uneccessarily and simply bans the practice outright In the section on initiating contact with the crown of the helmet the proposal drastically simplifies matters It now reads USE OF THE HELMET It is a foul if a player lowers his head  initiate and make contact with his helmet against an opponentBenjamin Hoffman contributed reporting from New YorkCollapse,sports

On SoccerLIVERPOOL England  This time there would be no knockout blow There would be no sense that once again a meeting between Liverpool and Chelsea would decide something would decide everything This time there would be only bruising and bruises healBy most standards the rivalry between these two clubs is a young one a distinctly 21stcentury phenomenon hardly older than Facebook But since 2003 they have conjured from nothing one of the fiercest feuds that English soccer can offerThe flames have been fueled in part  the sense that each team sees in the other its polar opposite It is telling that the songs Liverpool fans deploy  deride Chelsea focus on Chelseas supposed lack of hisry and that Chelsea supporters rebuttal concentrates on Liverpools more recent failingsJust as important as the contrast in selfimage however is that their meetings have  at least since 2003 the year the rivalry erupted  tended  be so highstakesThey have not always been pretty Jorge Valdano at the time a direcr at Real Madrid once claimed that Chelsea and Liverpools encounters summed up all that was wrong with soccer But they have rarely been less than significant With remarkable frequency these games have defined one or the other teams season more than once they have been decisive for the Premier League as a wholeNone perhaps have been quite so significant as Chelseas vicry in 2003 that ok it  the Champions League at Liverpools expense That match was a key moment in persuading Abramovich  save the club from financial despair And none have been quite so raucous as Liverpools revenge in 2005 when it knocked Chelsea out of the Champions League at the semifinal stage on the way  its triumph in the final in IstanbulBut those games were just the start There have been finals in both the FA Cup and the League Cup won  Chelsea It was Liverpool that ended Chelseas 86match home unbeaten streak in 2008 and Liverpools win at Stamford Bridge last season kickstarted the run that eventually cost Coach Jos Mourinho his jobTwice the league title itself has been snatched or surrendered in 2010 when Chelsea won  20 at Anfield  seal a championship for Carlo Ancelotti and in 2014 when Chelsea effectively crushed Liverpools hopes of a first title since 1990 with the same scoreTuesdays edition seemed ready  attain a similar status It had the air of a turning point A Chelsea win would have moved Manager Annio Conte and his players within realistic uching distance of the Premier League title a Liverpool vicry might have proved the point at which Chelseas advantage at the summit of the league standings started  erodeIn the event neither happened there was no knockout blow only minor damage in a 11 draw Chelseas wounds will in all probability heal a little sooner Contes team could have won had Diego Costa converted a late disputed penalty kick but Chelsea still managed  extend its Premier League lead With Arsenal having lost at home  Watford and Tottenham having tied lowly Sunderland on the road Chelsea sits 9 points ahead of second placeA share of the spoils was less palatable  LiverpoolManager Jrgen Klopp was in an ebullient mood afterward insisting that if most fans had been offered in the summer a time machine  take us  this point in the season in this position with 15 games  go and a full squad they would have gladly accepted itThey would of course Liverpool was not expected  mount a title challenge this year The received wisdom at the start of the season was that Klopps target in his first full year in England would be  resre Liverpool  the Champions League once a frequent destination for Liverpool but since 2009 a most elusive goal This draw may not have advanced the clubs hope of winning the league but it has not killed it off entirely either There remains a distant glimmer of hope That represents progress it just does not feel like thatTo some extent Klopp has only himself  blame Liverpool is a club predisposed  inflated hope and a searing start  the season  vicries over Arsenal and Chelsea on the road  served as license  dream A freeflowing attack scorers of more Premier League goals than any other masked deficiencies on defense and in goal Klopps bullish charisma seemed  have rubbed off on his players and Liverpools absence from other European competitions seemed  negate fears over the holes in the squadAnd then over a bitter January it all fell apart Injury bureaucracy and international commitments deprived Klopp of several key players Elimination from the two domestic urnaments in the space of a week highlighted just how thin his resources beyond his p 14 or 15 players really are He has been accused of lacking a Plan B an alternative way of playing  break down stubborn defenses  a somewhat woolly concept in English soccer still regarded as the hallmark of a great coachKlopp has sensed that he made a point Monday night of telling Liverpool  and he gave the impression of speaking about the fans as much as the players  not  lose its nerve Everything is still in play he said the season is far from overHe is right Liverpool may not be able  win the league not from here not with Chelsea running out of challenging opponents and far from running out of steam but then that was only ever a hope Liverpool and Klopp remain on track  more or less  for what they were supposed  achieve this season That it feels like a disappointment is not a sign that they have lost their way It indicates instead that they have simply traveled faster and further than anyone expectedCollapse,sports

It helped  develop all the new ways we watch TV  ondemand bingeing mobile But the Silicon Valley company still has  keep reinventing itselfTed Sarandos who runs Netflixs Hollywood operation and makes the companys deals with networks and studios was up first  rehearse his lines Pilots the fall season summer repeats live ratings  all hallmarks of traditional television  were falling away because of Netflix he boasted Unlike a network which needs shows that are ratings home runs  maximize viewers and hence ad dollars he continued Netflix also values singles and doubles that appeal  narrower segments of subscribers Its ability  analyze vast amounts of data about its cusmers viewing preferences helped it decide what content  buy and how much  pay for itSarandos can be an outspoken even gleeful critic of network practices in his zeal  promote what Netflix views as its superior model  ondemand and commercialfree streaming on any device That glee was on full display in these remarks For years he said consumers have been at the mercy of others when it comes  television The shows and movies they want  watch are subject  business models they do not understand and do not care about All they know is frustration That he added is the insight Netflix is built onWhen Sarandos was done Reed Hastings Netflixs chairman and chief executive ok the stage A pencilthin man he seemed swallowed up  the empty ballroom He squinted uncomfortably under the lights He and a number of other Netflix executives had spent the morning at a meeting in Laguna Calif where a rare rrential rainsrm grounded air traffic forcing them  make the fivehour drive  Las Vegas They arrived only a few hours earlier To make matters worse Hastings was feeling illHaggard and tired he stumbled irritably through his presentation But as he neared the finale Hastings broke out in a small satisfied smile While you have been listening  me talk he said reading from a monir the Netflix service has gone live in nearly every country in the world but China where we also hope  be in the future Even though this was only a practice run  and even though it would be a long time before anyone knew whether global expansion would pay off  the Netflix executives sitting in the ballroom let out a loud sustained cheerThey had good reason  celebrate Netflix since its streaming service debuted in 2007 has had its annual revenue grow sixfold  68 billion from 12 billion More than 81 million subscribers pay Netflix 8  12 a month and slowly but unmistakably these consumers are giving up cable for internet television Over the last five years cable has lost 67 million subscribers more than a quarter of millennials 70 percent of whom use streaming services report having never subscribed  cable in their lives Those still paying for cable television were watching less of it In 2015 for instance television viewing time was down 3 percent and 50 percent of that drop was directly attributable  Netflix according  a study  MoffettNathanson an investment firm that tracks the media businessAll of this has made Netflix a Wall Street favorite with a sck price that rose 134 percent last year Easy access  capital has allowed the company  bid aggressively on content for its service This year Netflix will spend 5 billion nearly three times what HBO spends on content which includes what it licenses shows like AMCs Better Call Saul and original series like House of Cards Its dozens of original shows more than 600 hours of original programming are planned for this year often receive as much critical acclaim and popular buzz as anything available on cable Having invented the bingestreaming phenomenon when it became the first company  put a shows entire season online at once it then secured a place in the popular culture Netflix and chillBut the assembled executives also had reason  worry Just because Netflix had essentially created this new world of internet TV was no guarantee that it could continue  dominate it Hulu a streaming service jointly owned  21st Century Fox Disney and NBC Universal had become more assertive in licensing and developing shows vying with Netflix for deals And there was other competition as well small companies like Vimeo and giants like Amazon an aggressive buyer of original series Even the networks which long considered Netflix an ally had begun  fight back  developing their own streaming apps Last fall Time Warner hinted that it was considering withholding its shows from Netflix and other streaming services for a longer period John Landgraf the chief executive of the FX networks  and one of the companys fiercest critics  ld a reporter a few months ago I look at Netflix as a company thats trying  take over the worldAt the moment Netflix has a negative cash flow of almost 1 billion it regularly needs  go  the debt market  replenish its coffers Its 68 billion in revenue last year pales in comparison  the 28 billion or so at media giants like Time Warner and 21st Century Fox And for all the original shows Netflix has underwritten it remains dependent on the very networks that fear its potential  destroy their longtime business model in the way that internet competirs undermined the newspaper and music industries Now that so many entertainment companies see it as an existential threat the question is whether Netflix can continue  thrive in the new TV universe that it has brought in beingNow that future has begun  take shape The television industry last went through this sort of turbulence in the late 1970s and early 1980s when cable television was maturing Previously of course television had been mostly transmitted via the public airwaves and the major networks made the bulk of their money from advertising But cable provided an indisputably better picture and the proliferation of cable networks came  offer a much greater variety of programming In time consumers concluded that it was worth paying for something  TV  that had previously been free This meant that in addition  advertising dollars each cable channel received revenue from all cable cusmers even those who didnt watch that channel By 2000 685 million Americans had subscriptions giving them access  the several hundred channels the industry ok  calling the cable bundleGet the best of the Magazine delivered  your inbox every week including exclusive feature

knew the internet would eventually compete with that bundle but he wasnt entirely sure how And so he had  be flexible Sarandos says that in 1999 Hastings thought shows would be downloaded rather than streamed At another point Netflix created a dedicated device through which  access its content only  decide that adapting its service  everything from mobile phones  TV sets made more sense The Netflix device was spun out in its own company Roku In 2007 even as Netflixs DVDmail business remained lucrative and long before the internet was ready  deliver a streaming movie without fits and starts Hastings directed Netflix  build a standalone streaming serviceSo the company shifted  television Cable networks like FX and AMC were developing expensive talkedabout dramas the kind HBO pioneered with The Sopranos and The Wire But these series with their complex seasonlong sry arcs and hourlong format seemed  be poor candidates for syndication unlike selfcontained halfhour sitcoms like Seinfeld which can be watched out of orderHastings and Sarandos realized that Netflix could become in effect the syndicar for these hourlong dramas We found an inefficiency is how Hastings describes this insight One of the first such series  appear on Netflix was AMCs Mad Men which became available on the site in 2011 between its fourth and fifth seasons Knowing from its DVD experience that cusmers often rented a full season of The Sopranos in one go Netflix put the entire first four seasons of Mad Men online at once Bingeing ok offTelevision networks lined up  license their shows  Netflix failing  see the threat it posed  the established order Its a bit like Is the Albanian Army going  take over the world  Jeff Bewkes the chief executive of Time Warner famously joked back in 2010 The occasional voice warned that Netflix would become o big for the industry  control but mostly the legacy media companies viewed the fees from Netflix as found money Streaming video ondemand rights as they were called hadnt even existed before Netflix asked  pay for them And because the networks didnt understand how valuable those rights would become Netflix got them for very little moneyEveryone seemed  be a winner including the shows themselves In 2012 for instance Netflix began streaming the first three seasons of Breaking Bad the dark drama produced  Sony that ran on AMC Though praised  critics Breaking Bad had not yet found its audienceWhen the folks at Sony said we were going  be on Netflix I didnt really know what that meant Vince Gilligan the crear of Breaking Bad ld me I knew Netflix was a company that sent you DVDs in the mail I didnt even know what streaming was Gilligan quickly found out It really kicked our viewership in high gear he says As Michael Nathanson an analyst at MoffettNathanson put it  me  Breaking Bad was 10 times more popular once it started streaming on NetflixThis was around the time that network executives started  recognize the threat that Netflix could eventually constitute  them Five years ago says Richard Greenfield a media and technology analyst at BTIG who happens  be Netflixs most vocal proponent on Wall Street we wrote a piece saying that the networks shouldnt license  Netflix because they were going  unleash a monster that would undermine their business Thats exactly what seemed  be happeningWorse they realized that Netflix didnt have  play  the same rules they did It didnt care when people watched the shows it licensed It had no vested interest in preserving the cable bundle On the contrary the more consumers who cut the cord the better for Netflix It didnt have billions of legacy profits  protectYet the networks couldnt walk away from the company either Many of them needed licensing fees from Netflix  make up for the revenue they were losing as traditional viewership shrank Negotiations between a network or a studio and Netflix became fraught as the networks understanding the value of their streaming rights sought much higher fees In some cases those negotiations broke down The Starz deal for example was not renewed after it ended in 2012 Chris Albrecht the chief executive of Starz would later describe the original deal as terribleWe could see that eventually AMC was going  be able  do its own ondemand streaming Hastings says Or FX We knew there was no longterm business in being a rerun company just as we knew there was no longterm business in being a DVDrental companyStill Hastings was cautious Producing original material is a very different business from licensing someone elses shows New content requires hefty upfront costs  one show alone would most likely cost more than the 30 million a year Netflix reportedly once paid Starz for its entire library of movies Developing its own series would thrust it in the unfamiliar business of engaging with producers direcrs and stars Back in 2006 the company set up a way  distribute independent films called Red Envelope Entertainment but it failed and Hastings shut it down We would have been better off spending the money on DVDs he ld me Now it was going  give original content another try  with much higher stakesSarandos had a show he was itching  buy House of Cards a political drama that was being pitched  David Fincher the wellknown direcr and would star Kevin Spacey Sarandos knew that according  Netflixs vast database many of the companys subscribers liked the kind of drama that Fincher and Spacey wanted  make But algorithms alone werent the deciding facr He and Hastings figured that Fincher who directed films like Fight Club and The Social Network would create a critical and popular sensationIn any case Sarandos said the potential reward vastly outweighed whatever financial and reputational risk House of Cards represented If it is a flop we will have overpaid for one series he ld Hastings But if it succeeds we will have changed the brandIn winning over Fincher Sarandos faced two other obstacles a competing offer from HBO which also wanted House of Cards and the fact that no one had ever made a show for a streaming service before For decades when movies went straight  video without a theater run they were ipso fac failures in Hollywoods view for a seasoned direcr like Fincher picking Netflix presented the same risk of marginalization Sarandos overcame both  offering freedom and money There are a thousand reasons for you not  do this with Netflix he ld Fincher But if you go with us well commit  two seasons with no pilot and no interference Sarandos also offered Fincher a reported 100 million for 26 episodes at the high end for an hourlong dramaThe first season of House of Cards became available in February 2013 It was an immediate hit with viewers and critics Five months later Netflix posted the first season of Orange Is the New Black which Sarandos had ordered before House of Cards went in production Critics lavished praise on the new show as well Having begun its life as a Silicon Valley tech company Netflix had somewhat improbably become a television networkBorn and raised in the Bosn suburbs  his greatgrandfather was the wealthy invesr Alfred Lee Loomis who played a critical role in the invention of radar  Hastings now 55 is one of those tech executives who came  California  attend Stanford grad school for computer science in his case and never left The tech company he ran before Netflix was called Pure Software which made debugging ols for software engineers Before Netflix Hastings had no experience in the entertainment industryAlthough news coverage now tends  focus on its shows Netflix remains every bit as much an engineering company as it is a content company There is a reason that its shows rarely suffer from streaming glitches even though at peak times they can sometimes account for 37 percent of internet traffic in 2011 Netflix engineers set up their own contentdelivery network with servers in more than 1000 locations Its user interface is relentlessly tested and tweaked  make it more appealing  users Netflix has the ability  track what people watch at what time of day whether they watch all the way through or sp after 10 minutes Netflix uses personalization algorithms  put shows in front of its subscribers that are likely  appeal  them Nathanson the analyst says They are a tech company Their strength is that they have a really good productIt is no surprise that Hastings given his engineering background believes that data above all else yields answers  and the bigger the data set the better The worst thing you can do at Netflix is say that you showed it  12 people in a focus room and they loved it says Todd Yellin the companys vice president of product innovation He likes  note that cusmers will at most consider only 40  50 shows or movies before deciding what  watch which makes it crucial that the company puts just the right 50 titles on each subscribers screen All the data Netflix collects and dissects can yield surprising correlations For example viewers who like House of Cards also often like the FX comedy Its Always Sunny in PhiladelphiaThere is another underappreciated aspect of Netflix that Hastings views as a competitive advantage what he calls its high performance culture The company seeks out and rewards star performers while unapologetically pushing out the restOne person who helped Hastings create that culture is a woman named Patty McCord The former head of human resources at Pure Software she was also Hastingss neighbor in Santa Cruz She carpooled  work with him and socialized with his family on weekends I thought the idea for Netflix was kind of stupid she ld me But she trusted Hastingss instincts and wanted  keep working with him Her title was chief talent officerThe origins of the Netflix culture date  Ocber 2001 The internet bubble burst the year before and Netflix once flush with venture capital was running out of money Netflix had  lay off roughly 50 employees shrinking the staff  a third It was Reeds first layoffs McCord says It was painfulThe remaining 100 or so employees despite working harder than before enjoyed their jobs more McCord and Hastings concluded that the reason was that they had held on the selfmotivated employees who assumed responsibility naturally Office politics virtually disappeared nobody had the time or the patience There was unusual clarity McCord says It was our survival It was either make this work or were dead McCord says Hastings ld her This is what a great company feels likeAs luck would have it the DVD business ok off right around the time of the layoffs By May 2002 Netflix was doing well enough  go public selling 55 million shares at 15 a share With the 825 million Netflix reaped from the offering Hastings started hiring aggressively again This time he and McCord focused on hiring fully formed adults in their words gogetters who put the companys interests ahead of their own egos showed initiative without being asked and embraced accountability Dissent and argument were encouraged even demandedFor those who fit in Netflix was a great place  work  empowering and rational There are no performance reviews no limits on vacation time or maternity leave in the first year and a onesentence expense policy Do what is in the companys best interest But those who could not adapt found that their tenure at Netflix was stressful and shortlived There was pressure on newcomers  show that they had what it ok  make it at Netflix those who didnt were let go Reed would say Why are we coming up with performance plans for people who are not going  work out  McCord says Instead Netflix simply wrote them a check and parted waysMcCord also convinced Hastings that he should ask himself a few times a year whether he would hire the same person in the same job if it opened up that day If the answer was no Netflix would write a larger check and let the employee go If you are going  insist on high performance McCord says then you have  get rid of the notion of retention Youll have  fire some really nice hardworking people But you have  do it with dignityI held the hands of people weeping saying I want  be here forever  McCord says I would tell them Nothing lasts forever I would say  Reed I love them o but it is our job  be sure that we always have the right people In 2004 the culture was codified enough for Netflix  put it on a sequence of slides which it posted on its corporate website five years later It is an extraordinary document 124 slides in all covering everything from its salaries it pays employees what it believes a competir trying  poach them would  why it rejects brilliant jerks cost  effective teamwork is o high The key concept is summed up in the 23rd slide Were a team not a family it reads Netflix leaders hire develop and cut smartly so we have stars in every positionAfter Hastings the executive I spent the most time with at Netflix was Yellin a former independent filmmaker who joined the company in early 2006 when he was in his early 40s Yellin quickly distinguished himself  pushing back hard whenever he thought Hastings was wrong about something There was a culture of questioning but I pushed the envelope he says He also helped develop a style of meeting that Id never seen before At the one I sat in on there were maybe 50 people in a small circular room with three tiers of seats like a tiny coliseum allowing everyone  easily see everyone else The issue at hand seemed pretty small  me They were discussing whether montages on the opening screen of the user interface would be more effective in keeping subscribers than still images or trailers But the intensity of the discussion made it clear that the group ok the matter very seriously Various hypotheses had been tested  sending out montages  100000 or so subscribers and comparing the results with another 100000 who got say still images This is classic AB testing as its known Every person present had something  say but while there were strong disagreements no ones feathers seemed ruffledOne of my last interviews at Netflix was with Tawni Cranz the companys current chief talent officer who started under Patty McCord in 2007 Five years later McCord her menr left When I asked her why she visibly flinched She wouldnt explain but I learned later that Hastings had let her goIt happened in 2011 after he made his biggest mistake as chief executive He split Netflix in two companies  one  manage the DVD business and the other  focus on streaming Cusmers were outraged for many the move meant a 60 percent price increase if they kept both the DVD and the streaming service With complaints mounting and subscribers canceling Hastings quickly reversed course and apologized In the three weeks following this episode the price of Netflix shares dropped 45 percent and Wall Street questioned the companys acumen Hastings decided  reevaluate everyone in the executive ranks using the litmus test McCord taught him Would he hire them again day One of the people this led him  push out was McCordIt made me sad she said when I called  ask her about it I had been working with Reed for 20 years Netflix had just given the goahead  House of Cards and McCord said she didnt want  walk away in the middle of the next thingBut she also felt a sense of pride She was gratified that Hastings had taken her advice so thoroughly  heartTed Murray said as they shook hands warmly you should get a promotion He grabbed Sarandos  the lapels pulled him close and added loudly You are the future The two men laughed uproariouslyFrom the time he arrived at Netflix in 2000 Sarandos has had the final say on both Netflixs licensing deals and its original programming An Arizona native Sarandos was working for a large videoretail chain when Hastings hired him  negotiate DVD deals directly with the studios Sarandos had been in love with movies all his life He worked his way through college  managing an independent video sre If he had chosen a different path its easy  imagine him having become a traditional Hollywood executive instead of an industry antagonistAt an investment conference late last year David Zaslav the chief executive of Discovery Communications which operates the Discovery Channel articulated the case for having networks rethink their relationship with Netflix Streaming videoondemand platforms only exist because of our content Zaslav said in an obvious reference  Netflix To the extent that our content doesnt exist on their platforms  not  be o pejorative  they are dumb pipes We as an industry are supporting economic models that dont make senseSarandos who had spoken earlier in the day had clearly anticipated the criticism Zaslav says that we built a great business on their content he said Thats just not true We did not renew their deal when they wanted a premium So we replaced it with other programming that got us just as many viewers for less moneyThose who think Netflix will come  dominate television have a simple rationale Netflix has exposed and taken advantage of the limitations of conventional TV The more time people spend on Netflix  its now up  nearly two hours a day  the less they watch network television Our thesis is that bingeing drives more bingeing says Greenfield the Wall Street analyst Once people start watching shows that dont have commercials they never want  go back Waiting week after week for the next episode of a favorite show he says is not a good experience for consumers anymoreStill despite the rise in Netflixs share price over the past few years the company has no shortage of doubters on Wall Street Some distrust Netflixs numbers arguing that millions of people no longer watch the service anymore but keep their subscriptions because they are so inexpensive Netflix has announced that it will raise prices this year and the Netflix skeptics believe the price increase will cause subscribers  cancel in droves Other critics note the slowdown in the growth of domestic subscribers  far the companys most profitable segment In addition Netflix between its content costs and the cost of adding subscribers is spending more than it collects in revenue How long can that continueFinally the pessimists point out that Netflix makes very little profit In the first quarter of this year for instance Netflix had nearly 2 billion in revenue but only 28 million in profit Despite the significant moves  Netflix in original programming Wall Street still values Netflix more like a platform company  a business that uses the internet  match buyers and sellers like Uber  than a content company like a studio or a network Its valuation is currently 5 billion more than Sony for example Hastings who has been very blunt about the companys strategy of plowing money back in the business has promised bigger profits sometime in 2017 Whether he can deliver on that promise will be a significant test of invesrs faith in himOne of the most prominent Netflix skeptics is Michael Pachter a research analyst at Wedbush Securities a Los Angelesbased investment bank In his view Netflixs true advantage in the beginning was that it had the entire game  itself and the networks not realizing how valuable streaming rights would be practically gave them away He had a buy on the sck from 2007  2010 he ld me But he added referring  those years when Netflix had streaming all  itself If its o good  be true then it will attract competitionNow he said the networks and studios are charging higher fees for their shows forcing up Netflixs costs Netflix doesnt own most of the shows that it buys or commissions like House of Cards so it has  pay more when it renews a popular show In addition  the money it now spends on content it also has more than 12 billion in future obligations for shows it has ordered The only way it can pay for all of that is  continue adding subscribers and raise subscription rates And even then Pachter says the networks will extract a piece of any extra revenue Netflix generates It is nave  think that Netflix can raise its price  2 a month and keep all the upside he said I defy you  look at any form of content where the distribur raises prices and the supplier doesnt get more Thats the dumbest thing I ever heardNetflix Pachter concluded is caught in an arms race they invented He compared Netflix  a rat racing on a wheel staying ahead only  going faster and faster and spending more and more As its costs continue  go up it needs  constantly generate more subscribers  stay ahead of othersAnd if that doesnt happen If subscriber growth were  stall for instance then Wall Street would sp treating it as a growth sck and its price would start falling Slower growth would also increase the cost of taking on more debt  pay for its shows The company would be forced  either raise subscription prices even higher or cut back on those content costs or do both which could slow subscriber growth even further Netflixs virtuous circle  subscriber growth and content expenditures driving each other  would become a vicious circle insteadMatthew Ball a strategist for Otter  who writes often about the future of television thinks the latter is more likely He says that day when you have a cable subscription you have access  hundreds of channels  in effect they all share you as a cusmer The cable bundle puts you in a television ecosystem and you flip from one show  the other depending on what you want  watch In the emerging ondemand world television wont work that way All the networks will have their own streaming service and cusmers will have  pay a fee for every one The days when networks could make money from people who never watch their shows will endOne consequence is that networks will have  have oneonone relationships with their viewers  something they have little experience with and which Netflix with its ability  personalize its interactions with its 81 million cusmers has mastered Another consequence is that as streaming becomes the primary way people watch television they are highly unlikely  pay for more than a small handful of subscriptionTV networks What they will want Ball believes is a different setup companies that offer far more programming than any one network can provide Netflix clearly has already created that kind of ecosystem Netflix is ABC it is Discovery it is AMC it is USA and all the other networks Ball said Its subscribers dont say I love Netflix for Westerns but Ill go somewhere else for scifi The old model just doesnt work in an ondemand worldIn this vision of the future Netflixs most potent competir is likely  be Amazon which is also developing an extensive array of content including many of its own original shows Early on it o produced a highly praised series Transparent It o has no allegiance  the cable bundle And it has the kind of revenue  exceeding 100 billion  that neither the networks nor Netflix can approach Compared  the networks Netflix may have an imposing war chest but in a fight with Amazon it would be outgunnedAccording  Ball what Netflix is counting on  maintain its primacy and  start making big profits is unprecedented scale Thats where the effort  create a global network the one that was announced in January at the Consumer Electronics Show comes in In April when the company announced its firstquarter results it said it had added 45 million international subscribers Yet success and profits are still some way off as Hastings is the first  acknowledgeYouTube he notes is available in more than 50 languages Netflix can be seen in only 20 languages Netflix was primarily attracting people in its new countries who speak English as it races  localize its service in each country Netflix is ordering shows with an international flavor like Narcos but so far it has only a handful up and running Netflix wants  make the best Bollywood movie thats ever been produced Hastings ld an Indian publication it wants  make Japanese anime it wants  make local films for every market it wants global rights when it licenses shows  something that once again contravenes Hollywoods conventional business model in which rights are sold on a countrycountry basis The company still has much  learn about each countrys quirks and tastes and cusms and it will be a while before it can hope  earn a profit from its global cusmersWhen we were in the DVD business Hastings said it was hard  see how we would get  streaming Then it was hard  see how  go from a domestic company  a global one And how  go from a company that licensed shows  one that had its own original shows Now it knew exactly where it was going Our challenges are execution challenges he ld meAsked what the competitive landscape would look like five years in the future he returned  the analogy he used earlier with the evolution of the telephone Landlines had been losing out  mobile phones for the past 15 years he said but it had been a gradual process The same he believed would be true of televisionThere wont be a dramatic tipping point he said What you will see is that the bundle gets used less and less For now even as Hulu and Amazon were emerging as rivals he claimed that the true competition was still for users time not just the time they spent

TrilobitesA battle over pleasure has broken out On Twitter and in the pages of scientific journals psychologists neurologists and neuroscientists are forging alliances over the question of whether pleasure we get from art is somehow different from the pleasure we get from candy sex or drugsShe offered up an unconventional solution art which she says engages us in ways these other pleasures do not and can help overwrite the detrimental effects of dysfunctional urges and cravingThe paper struck a nerve with some of her fellow art and pleasure researchers who published a rebuttal last month in the same journal The idea that the way that art engages the brain is somehow special has been around for far o long and it is time  kill it off once and for all they insistThe arguments over Dr Christensens paper pointed  disputes within the emerging field of neuroaesthetics or the study of the neural processes underlying our appreciation and the production of beautiful objects and artworks On Team 1 youll find the argument that the experience of pleasure from art is neurobiologically identical  the experience of pleasure from candy or sex Team 2 believes that both making and appreciating art can offer unique neurobiological rewards Team 3 asks Who knows Who cares seems  be a subset of this groupGiven that pleasure is known  be a powerful motivar of human behavior its a dispute with implications far beyond art  at least according  Team 1 and Team 2There are some core elements that all sides seem  agree on As with wine how much people enjoy art seems  be affected  contextual cues like price or the reputation of the crear Art is difficult but possible  define Definitions vary however Across cultures what people perceive as beautiful is less consistent with artwork than it is with architecture landscapes and faces Faces are the most consistentWhat researchers do not agree on is whether enjoying a da Vinci engages a different neural process than enjoying a visit  Pornhub or McDonaldsDr Nadal speaking for Team 1 said in an interview that humans appear  use only one pleasure system  assess how pleasurable or unpleasurable a sensory experience is He calls this discovery one of the most important insights  emerge from the last 15 years of neuroscience and believes it shows that while enjoying CheezIts or a sculpture may feel different in our brains they are processed the same wayOthers who study pleasure are not convincedTalking in terms of shared neural systems is foolish said Paul Bloom a psychology professor at Yale University and author of the book How Pleasure Works The New Science of Why We Like What We LikeHe thinks that art scratches all kinds of itches While watching The Sopranos or parallel parking a car are all done  the brain he says that doesnt mean they are the sameI know these projects are tally irrational tally useless the conceptual artist Chris has said about his 168 million project The Floating Piers Some researchers would point  science  say thats not true  its benefits are specialThis highlevel pleasure requires more scientific investigation But given that we spend our lives chasing pleasures she argues why not try  better understand one of the few that do not induce states of craving without fulfillment or cause health problems and instead make you think and experience things differentlyAll of this may lead you  ask If pleasures are so similar why dont people ever orgasm from pleasure associated with food or art Actually some doShe cannot yet say why which lends support  the broader notion that there is really so much we as scientists still dont understand about pleasureCollapse,sports

As protests  NFL players during the national anthem seem  have settled down the grievance case against the league  the man who started it all the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is proceedingYou may not have heard much about it lately because it is transpiring behind closed doors And it is unlike any legal proceeding you might have seen before not really a trial but with elements of oneThe rules on how the investigation is conducted and  whom  and all the quirks of what evidence is allowed  are detailed in the zantine labor agreement between the league and playersIt was designed with due process in mind but as often happens with cases involving the NFL the decisions are appealed and end up in federal courtKaepernick who began kneeling last season during the anthem  protest racism and police brutality ward AfricanAmericans opted out of his contract in March and has not played a down sinceYet he has become a rallying point for protests with dozens of players this season at various points kneeling or making some gesture during the anthem though lately the numbers have trailed off In the meantime he has watched about two dozen quarterbacks  including one who came out of retirement  join teamsHere is a look at his caseWho will hear the caseUnder Article 17 of the labor agreement between the NFL and the players all cases of collusion are heard  an independent arbitrar appointed  agreement of the NFL and the players union Stephen B Burbank a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School has held that role for many yearsWhat are the rules for gathering evidenceUnusual for a sports labor agreement the NFL uses the Federal Rules of Evidence which are more in line with court trials This means among other things that thirdparty companies will be hired  help gather evidence including for instance a search of computers and cellphones of league and team officials  find references  Kaepernick The arbitrar will weigh the evidence and arguments of both sides perhaps conducting hearings and make a decisionWhat is the definition of collusion in this caseAccording  the leagues labor agreement which was last updated in 2011 no team its employees or agents shall enter in any agreement express or implied with the NFL or any other Club its employees or agents  restrict or limit individual Club decisionmaking negotiations with any playerHow will Kaepernick prove there was collusion  keep him outSeveral quarterbacks of seemingly lesser ability or experience have been signed as starters or backups something Kaepernicks lawyers point  as evidence teams are deliberately passing over his clientBut proving collusion will be difficult legal experts say because teams have many reasons for signing one quarterback over another including his age his salary his temperament how he fits in an offensive system and other available quarterbacksTheres a host of reasons why a club would individually or independently not offer him a contract said Matt Mitten the executive direcr of the National Sports Law Institute at Marquette University Law School So it will be ugh for them  argue that there was a tacit agreementIt also is rare  find an email text or phone conversation that explicitly shows that teams worked gether  shun a player or that league officials directed them  do soHow does Kaepernick intend  prove collusionKaepernicks lawyer Mark Geragos a prominent criminal lawyer based in Los Angeles has submitted a list of people he wants  depose including Commissioner Roger odell and several owners who have been vocal about their opposition  player protests including Jerry Jones the Dallas Cowboys owner and the owner of the Housn Texans Bob McNairHe will also look for clues in the emails and other documentation from the computer and cellphones searches The NFL though can argue that the document requests are o broad or the requests  depose certain individuals are irrelevant The arbitrar will ultimately decide on any objectionsHave players won collusion cases in the pastCollusion cases involving individual players are rare in the NFL but baseball players filed a series of successful cases against Major League Baseball in the 1980sHow much of this case will be publicVery little of the proceedings of the grievance will be made public though the ruling will ultimately be released It is unlikely a decision will be made before the season endsWhat does Kaepernick stand  gain if he winsAccording  the labor agreement Kaepernick would receive twice what he might have earned if he was playingCould the two sides settle before a rulingIn theory yes The NFL might for instance want  avoid having its p executives deposed or any negative publicity stemming from the case In exchange for his dropping the case they could offer Kaepernick a financial settlement while admitting no wrongdoingWould the league be forced  give him a shot on a team if it is shown it deliberately kept him outThe league cannot force a team  assess or sign KaepernickCollapse,sports

On SoccerMANCHESTER England  To Pep Guardiola as  anyone involved in elite sports the very idea of being second best is anathema So Guardiola the Manchester City manager did not need  pause for thought when he was asked whether in certain circumstances there is no difference between coming in second and finishing firstI prefer first he said without missing a beat Pushed for an explanation he demurred I dont know why he said Its a good question I just prefer it It is an instinct a reflex one that would be shared  any manager any player in any sport Theirs is a world after all in which second is never good enoughThere are occasions though when it is not without its attractions On Wednesday Real Madrid will host Borussia Dortmund in the final round of group games in this seasons Champions League Both teams are already assured of a place in the competitions round of 16 next year but this week they will meet  decide which of them will advance as their groups winner Dortmund currently has 13 points Real Madrid 11 It is winner takes allOr it should be anyway The vagaries of the draw for the knockout rounds however mean that it is not quite that simple For Real Madrid in particular there will be a sneaking suspicion that it is second rather than first that brings the true prizeShould Madrid the reigning champion beat Dortmund and finish ap Group F it could draw Bayer Leverkusen or F C Por when the knockout stage begins in February It could however also find itself paired with either Bayern Munich or Guardiolas Manchester City an algether more intimidating prospectBy contrast finishing second would allow Real  avoid both of those teams More significant the rules governing the draw for the round of 16  teams cannot face opponents they have faced in their group or those from their own country  would also inoculate Real from hazardous ties with not just Dortmund but Atltico Madrid and Barcelona oThere are still dangers of course  a secondplace Real could draw Juventus or the winner of Group A either Arsenal or Paris StGermain  but the odds would be on its receiving a somewhat softer landing Of the five other likely potential opponents three are Monaco a stuttering Leicester City and the winner of the BesiktasBenficaNapoli group Yes second place is not without its attractionsManchester City and Bayern Munich which are already guaranteed secondplace finishes are in a similar situation Bayern cannot draw Dortmund or Atltico which visits Bavaria in the group stage finale on Tuesday so it will be hoping for Monaco or Leicester rather than Juventus or PSG Guardiola might have preferred  finish first but at least  coming in second City will avoid Barcelona Bayern and potentially Real Madrid as well as LeicesterThat is not his only solace Guardiola believes o that how a team qualifies for the last 16 is not the most important facr in determining how well it performs once it is thereMy experience in the Champions League is that what matters is how you arrive in February he said The draw is on Monday and we will analyze the team and say who is the favorite  get  the next round But the game is in February and many things will happen before thatHisry does not quite bear that out In four of the last five years six of the eight group winners have gone on  qualify for the quarterfinals In the other season  the 201314 edition  all eight made it through That raw statistic would suggest that playing the away leg of a homeandhome series first is something of a head start as it is supposed  beMore likely though is that it hints at something else Over the last 10 years or so what was a creeping transformation in the nature of the Champions League has become an overwhelming one The urnament particularly in the knockout stages has been colonized  a clutch of superclubs Since 2010 Barcelona Bayern and Real Madrid have accounted for almost twothirds of the semifinal spots In the last three years only Atltico Madrid has suggested it is capable of breaking  or becoming part of  that strangleholdThat the climax  this seasons group stages is so low key only strengthens that impression Of the 16 spots available in the knockout rounds only four have yet  be claimed At this stage last season there were seven slots still up for grabs in 2012 there were 10This year the few big clubs that do not yet know their places  Arsenal PSG Real Madrid and Dortmund  are merely scrapping for position The last vestiges of drama are in Group B where Benfica Napoli and Besiktas can all still qualify Group G where Por and Copenhagen retain hope and Group H where Lyon against Sevilla has the air of a shoout Only once in 20 years have there been fewer meaningful matches at the end of the group stagesThat is not the only change If Napoli makes it through 14 of the last 16 teams in the urnament will be from one of Europes socalled Big Five leagues the domestic competitions of England Spain Italy Germany and France Currently all but one of those teams scheduled  qualify are among those with the largest salary budgets The only exception is Tottenham which was eliminated despite a higher budget than Monaco or LeverkusenTo Guardiola that is normal that is good I prefer the best teams  be thereIn another light though it is a problem and one likely  be exacerbated  the unpopular decision  UEFA European soccers governing body  guarantee the leagues ranked as the continents four most powerful get four aumatic spaces each in the group stage from 2018 onwardIncreasingly the Champions League feels somehow preordained ever more homogeneous ever more predictable That this weeks matches feel like a boxchecking exercise a formality is part of it so o is the fact that it does not matter who finishes first and who finishes second After all it is the same games the same teams who prosper in the endCollapse,sports

ahead and check the box on the most important metric of the Knicks young season and perhaps their entire season the allimportant vision thingPart A Kristaps Porzingis comfortably views himself as the heir  the role of franchise playerPart B Frank Ntilikina the rookie point guard from France clearly sees the floorNot  overstate the value of a threegame winning streak following the same number of dismal defeats but six games in it is already safe  say that anyone mourning the end of the Carmelo Anthony era has lifted the veil and shed the fear that Porzingis needed cover from the pressure of being a leading man in big bad New YorkFrom the beginning I wasnt scared he said before a careerhigh 38 points powered a 116110 Knicks vicry over Denver on Monday night at a suddenly buzzed Madison Square GardenMoving on from the Anthony era was never going  be difficult because it wasnt really memorable or all that watchable And while Anthony was as deadly a scorer as the Garden has ever regularly observed there was never much evidence that he was a born leaderIn that vein Porzingis has challenges ahead not the least of which will be staying healthy and upbeat if the losses should mount But at 22 and having promised in three languages Latvian Spanish and English at 19 that he was no soft shy European he has gracefully embraced his promotionAs Porzingis drained free throws  seal a game the Knicks dominated except for one horrific thirdquarter stretch I mentioned  someone sitting next  me at the Garden that Porzingiss willingness  blow off an exit meeting with Phil Jackson last April when Jackson still ran the team was actually an example of a precocious young star showing convictionPeople said he should have ld Phil what he was upset about directly but he was sending a message  ownership that he wasnt going  accept the chaotic way the franchise was being run I said Even if his people put him up  itThe guy introduced himself as Dan Rohme of the agency ASM Sports  or as he said one of Kristapss peopleOopsFor what its worth he didnt bother  correct meMission accomplished Jackson ok the bait commenced fielding trade offers for Porzingis and was soon posting on Twitter a selfie of his unemployed bare feet from his Montana retreatThe unofficial Friends of Anthony association will point out that he was routinely targeted for not sharing the ball enough while Porzingis will get a pass for his own highvolume shooting In the six games  date this season while averaging 293 points he has all of 5 assistsThe crucial difference is in the approach While he obviously feels free  launch from far and away occasionally o soon Porzingis gets most of his shots within the flow of an offense He is also demonstrating a greater comfort closer  the basket  catching turning and daring a player several inches smaller  block his shotAs Rohme said wait until his slender legs fill out and allow Porzingis at 7 feet 3 inches  better fend off the more brutish post defendersWhile Porzingis isnt opening eyes with his passing the way Nikola Jokic Denvers 610 Serbian stud has since becoming the hub of the Nuggets offense hes not exactly inhibiting teammates from getting theirsHaving watched the Knicks beat the Nets last Friday night at the Garden in a seat behind the home teams bench what struck me about Ntilikina was how he plays with his eyes literally open wide  though not in stage frightHe may not be as audacious a rookie as Porzingis was but nor is he averse  being bold in moments Ntilikina made several passes  bounce passes for the purists left among us  against the Nets in transition that more even than Porzingis roused the Garden in the way that only visionary ballsharing canNtilikina was injured during summer league and for most of training camp so who knew In the Knicks pregame locker room Monday night Kanter said he didLet me tell you something his vision is probably one of the p 10 in the NBA right now he ld meReallyYes His vision is unbelievable Hes going  be specialHe is also rookie raw with nine turnovers  go with 10 assists including an embarrassing strip while dribbling the ball up court against Denvers Will Barn Lets also note that Kanter was hyping Porzingis for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award on Monday night suggesting that three straight wins with Housn in wn on Wednesday night have been inxicating if not mindalteringThen again along with excellent court vision Ntilikina is 65 with long limbs that foretell an ability for the Knicks  finally address a ruinous lack of defensive pressure at the point of attack Kanter o should know transcendent potential when he sees it having shared much court time at his last sp in Oklahoma City with Russell Westbrook and Kevin DurantIt would be cruelly unfair  expect or predict that level of greatness on anyone But given early evidence of a tandem that will give the Knicks a real foundation why not at least begin the anthem of hope with O say can you seeCollapse,sports

Common SenseWith the Tony Awards coming on Sunday night I decided this week that Id better bite the bullet and buy tickets  Hello Dolly in case Bette Midler wins best actress and tickets become even more scarce and expensiveI knew the tickets would be steep Thanks  whats known as dynamic pricing in which costs shift constantly  match demand p ticket prices for hit shows on Broadway have hit previously unheardof levels Annual Broadway ticket sales reached a record 145 billion for the justended seasonWhen I went online Wednesday the p price for that nights performance of Hello Dolly at several ticket resellers was 1450 give or take a few dollars It was sold out both on Telecharge and at the Shubert Theater box officeAs premium ticket prices have soared many buyers have responded with outrage accusing theater owners of price gouging and bemoaning the emergence of Broadway as one more exclusive preserve for the ultrarich Both themes were prominent in reader comments on the Times articleBut guess what There was also one Hello Dolly ticket for 194 on Wednesday evening available from an online reseller albeit for a balcony seat And there were more than a dozen seats at prices well below 750And if youre willing  forgo the potentially onceinalifetime experience of seeing Bette Midler as Dolly Levi TodayTix a relatively new purveyor was offering seats for future performances starring the critically lauded Donna Murphy  for 39The venerable TKTS booth in Times Square had 22 Broadway shows on offer for Wednesday evening nearly all at 50 percent offPeople have been whipped in a frenzy  the p prices said Thomas Schumacher president of the Disney Theatrical Group producer of the current dynamically priced hit musicals The Lion King and Aladdin If youre a regular person who wants  see a Broadway show night you can There are tickets for 29 You may be priced out of the best seats at the hottest shows but the same is true of a deluxe suite at the St Regis or a restaurant on New Years DayEven at hit shows relatively few seats sell at headlinemaking prices Mr Schumacher noted that the average price of a ticket for Aladdin one of the five pgrossing shows on Broadway was 112 last yearAverage Broadway ticket prices last season rose  109 from the prior seasons 103 a 58 percent increase Thats more than the rate of inflation but still not exorbitant considering the disproportionate impact of a few megahits like Hamiln The higher prices compensated for  or perhaps contributed   a decline in the number of tickets soldAs more transactions shift  the internet consumers will have  get used  a world in which dynamic pricing is increasingly the norm Theyve pretty much accepted it for airline fares airlines pioneered the concept years ago It has since spread  hotel rooms sporting events concerts and designer clothing  and is likely  be used for just about any highly differentiated product where demand may at times far exceed supplyAt the most basic level all pricing is about allocating scarce resources said Robert Phillips the head of marketplace optimization sciences at Uber the car service that has pioneered surge pricing in local transportation Surge pricing is another form of dynamic pricing Mr Phillips previously headed Columbia Universitys Center for Pricing and Revenue ManagementIve worked in theater concerts and sports he said and they all have a similar problem For extreme hits demand at what people would consider a reasonable price far exceeds supplyFrom an economics perspective this is simply a rationing problem he added If you keep prices low people will buy tickets and resell them on the secondary market Someone is going  pay a marketclearing price no matter how high The only question is who should get the money the invesrs and performers and crears or a specular who managed  snap up the tickets the moment the box office openedHowever creative the product says Howard Sherman direcr of the Arts Integrity Initiative for the New School College of Performing Arts Broadway is not immune from the forces of any marketplaceAs somebody who believes theater and live performing arts are an incredibly important part of our society Id love  be able  say that ticket prices should stay artificially low said Mr Sherman who is also a United States theater columnist for the British weekly The Stage But that denies the reality of what commercial theater is Shows have a responsibility  return money  the people who invested in them and  the people who created the showBut it was only because the price was so high that I was able  buy tickets at all on such short notice he added If legal restrictions or moral sanctions had forced prices  remain close  face value it is likely that no tickets would have been available  the time my family got around  planning its trip  the cityWhen I reached him this week Mr Mankiw said he thought the backlash  high theater prices reflected a broader anticapitalist bias People say they believe in capitalism but when prices rise  clear markets they say its unfair he said I have some sympathy for that when youre talking about fundamental rights like perhaps health care But scarce tickets  HamilnI asked him if Hamiln tickets had been worth the cost Every penny Mr Mankiw said It was fantastic one of the best things Ive ever seenJust as smart travelers know how  find bargain airline seats there are some simple ways ticket buyers can use dynamic pricing  their advantage since it yields bargains along with premium prices Weekday shows and especially Wednesday matinees are generally in far less demand than weekend shows January and September are the best months for cheap seats Prices are usually lower before a show officially opens and critics weigh in as long as the reviews are positiveAnd as I discovered it helps  be flexible While I started out this week looking for Hello Dolly tickets I ended up at Groundhog Day a new show with seven Tony nominations including best musical and best acr for a small fraction of the price of seeing Bette Midler Seats for Groundhog Day were available at TKTS for halfprice and online for 50 And I loved itDynamic pricing and superpremium prices may be relatively new but the scarcity of tickets for hit shows has a long tradition Mr Schumacher cited My Fair Lady the Hamiln of the 195556 Broadway season As Broadway lore has it a man in the audience turned  his neighbor an older woman and asked why the fifthrow center seat next  her was emptyMy husband died she repliedDidnt anyone else want  come he askedNo she answered Theyre all at the funeralCollapse,sports

On SoccerHEERENVEEN the Netherlands  Fans are melting away from all four sides of the Abe Lenstra Stadium as SC Heerenveens players amble around the edge of the field taking in a cursory lap of honor after a hardfought win against Sparta RotterdamMost of the squad is going through the motions taking the shortest route possible cutting the corners They chat among themselves occasionally lifting their heads  pick out friends and family in the crowd or  offer brief bursts of soft mechanical applauseOnly two players find themselves waylaid One Denzel Dumfries has been voted man of the match He scored the winning goal and is now being held back  the need  balance the enormous bouquet of flowers he has received as his rewardThe other dallying behind the main group has had a less productive evening Martin Odegaard did not play badly he had no shortage of energy no drought of ideas It was just one of those games where nothing quite worked His uch was a little heavy his passes just slightly off keyAs he walks past the fans though there is a jolt of anticipation A group of children summon him  the sideline They stretch out their hands for him  uch or proffer cellphones and scraps of paper for selfies and augraphs At this midtable team in this backwater wn Odegaard still carries with him an air of almost impossible glamourHe was registered for Reals B team at the time under the oversight of Zinedine Zidane but trained most often alongside Cristiano Ronaldo Gareth Bale and the rest of the clubs seniorteam stars In May of that year Odegaard made his debut for Reals senior team It made him the youngest player  play for the European champions oThat buzz has long since abated All of the noise that surrounded Odegaard for a year has disappeared Soccer impatient has moved on  other prodigies As Odegaard  still just 19 still bafaced  dutifully signs augraphs and poses for pictures on a bitterly cold night in this city in the north of the Netherlands it is impossible not  think that he is a long way from Real Madrid a long way from where he was meant  be and  wonder whether moving  the biggest team in the world was o much o soonIt is impossible  answer that question Tore Pedersen a former Norwegian international defender said when asked whether Odegaard could have found a more direct route  his goals  choosing another of his suirs Pedersen now an agent consulted on Odegaards moves  both Madrid and HeerenveenOf far more significance   Odegaard and  those concerned with his career  is that he is now in the right place  nurture his talent In two years at Real Madrid he made only one start for the first team in the Copa del Rey Carlo Ancelotti the clubs former manager dismissed his signing as a PR stuntZidane who coached him on the B team would not go that far but he also did not draft Odegaard in the senior team when he was named manager In January last year Odegaard decided he needed an intermediate step the chance  play competitive games somewhereA loan  Heerenveen was deemed the best option It was a good chance  play Pedersen said The culture is similar in Holland  Norway so it easier  settle and Heerenveen has a good record with Scandinavian playersIt would be a home away from home the thinking ran a more natural progression in the senior game Morten Thors one of several Norwegians on Heerenveens roster contacted Odegaard  persuade himThe Netherlands o seemed  offer the right environment  allow him  flourish There is a little bit more space a little bit more time said Stijn Schaars Heerenveens captain of the style of play in the p division known as the Eredivisie It is good for young players  grow  develop the game and the body before moving on  other leaguesThat is not  say it was easy Odegaards first day at the club brought more television cameras than Heerenveens manager Jurgen Streppel had ever seen Its what you expect for a European Championship final he said Despite the otherworldly vibe that Odegaard seemed  bring though he was still just a teenager unaccusmed  the stresses and strains of elite soccer By his own admission he had mixed feelings about his first six months He passed on a request  be interviewed for this articleHeerenveen kept its faith Odegaard asked  be given the coveted No 10 jersey last summer and his wish was granted Streppel promised him he was one of the four key players in his plans for this season but asked that he try  be more decisive in gamesHe has  be able  make a difference in Holland in game after game Streppel ld the Norwegian newspaper VG Only that will be good enough if he is  succeed in a really p teamThis season has brought an improvement Odegaard has scored just one Eredivisie goal in 15 league appearances and created only one other but nobody at Heerenveen plays more key passes per game He is learning o  be more vocal He is not a guy with a big mouth Schaars said But he is a smart player Smart players have more vision than normal players so if you see something say itThat is why Odegaard is here  mature on the field and off it He has passed his driving test  when he first arrived the club issued him a bicycle  help him get around  and he now lives on his own after his father who had lived with him for six months returned  Norway He intends  go back  the Bernabu as a man rather than a boyThat has always been the aim  win a place at Real Madrid He has not forgotten why he is here and his parent club has not forgotten him either Real Madrid is in regular contact with Odegaard his father and Heerenveen  monir his progress Video of his games is regularly sent back  Madrid and every so often a scout comes  see him in the fleshAgainst Sparta an observer would not have seen a player who looks ready  displace Ronaldo or Isco or any of the other superstars on Reals books He may have  go out on loan again before he can make that leap that decision Pedersen said will be made in the summer But as he was swarmed  fans they would have seen a boy who still shines even after three years in the shadowsCollapse,sports

KUTZTOWN Pa  There are only a few dozen international students at the mediumsize university nestled here in the Berks County hills where the clacking hooves of horsedrawn Mennonite buggies can be a more familiar sound than a car horn on the local streetsBut on weeknights at 11 the turf field at the center of campus transforms in something like a model United Nations There Kutzwn students from England Scotland South Africa Australia and Jamaica along with American players from 22 states gather  take part in a common affinity rugDespite the odd practice times there is nothing ragtag about the Kutzwn University rug team It crisscrosses the country every year for urnaments and often wins them The players take yoga classes and perform community service Their coach Gregg Jones a retired chiropracr and former Marine enforces a curfew mandary study halls and an alloserious requirement that players make their beds each morningThis is a varsity program said Paul Presinzano the direcr of Rug United the programs fundraising armExcept technically it is notKutzwn rug is a club meaning it is not run out of the universitys athletic department not provided access  varsity support staff members or trainers and not governed under the wide umbrella of the NCAA the organization synonymous with intercollegiate athleticsYet last Saturday and Sunday Kutzwn was one of 24 teams  most of them clubs  competing in the eighth annual Collegiate Rug Championship at Talen Energy Stadium home of the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer More than 27000 fans showed up for the weekend games  exceeding the attendance at 10 college football bowl games last year And the event was televised nationally  NBCs sports networksKutzwn which plays other sports in the NCAAs Division II and boasts a football stadium named after its most famous alumnus the NFL Hall of Famer Andre Reed has found that certain club sports can be more vital than it ever anticipated And in rugs success a glimpse is offered in a future for college sports outside the NCAA bubbleRug has put us on the map said Kenneth Hawkinson the Kutzwn presidentIt has done so on a shoestring budget that is made up largely of fundraising  passionate alums like Presinzano who set a goal of raising 100000 in 2017 The team is about halfway there The university supports the program which has more than 50 players with a modest contribution  20000 through its department of recreational services  and players pay dues of 200 each semester which covers their uniforms and travel bagsJones who goes  Doc is a volunteer as has been the case since he founded the program in 1986 At the time college rug was known for its mostly fraternity partyboy culture heavy on the drinking and hooliganism Joness team was composed of whoever was already on campus and had expressed even a passing interestWe were constantly coaching kids who never saw a rug ball he saidNow Jones and his assistant coach Larry Chester scour the world for talent starting with prospects as young as 13 And their recruiting pitch  come play for Kutzwn  does not get as many raised eyebrows as it used Everything we do the attitude the culture the facilities Jones said its all varsityThere are two NCAA Division I mens rug programs California and Army and a smattering of others across Division II Division III and the lowerprofile National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Other colleges like Penn State give mens rug a quasivarsity status with paid coaches and access  trainers and support staff in the athletic departmentBut Jack Clark the longtime coach at Cal which has won 27 national championships since 1980 said the lines between varsity quasivarsity and club teams were becoming significantly blurredSome teams that are not intercollegiate you wouldnt know it  looking at them Clark said Theyre pretty well put gether outfitsB David Ridpath an associate professor of sports administration at Ohio University writes about the growth of socalled hybrid models of club sports in a coming book The teams are affiliated with the university for marketing but do not have the connection  eligibility and all the things I think are more problems than actually educational benevolence as we claim he saidThe aunomy experienced  the clubs is not unlike that which the socalled Power Five conferences sought when they threatened secession from the NCAA in 2014 a move that won them at least partial selfgovernance Though Jones demands that players maintain a solid grade point average and conduct themselves in a respectable manner the club is technically student run and student led  and thus free  ignore the NCAA rule bookRidpath a vocal critic of the NCAA who advocates protecting academic integrity from the commercialization of college sports said it was a perfect example of a selfsustainable athletic ecosystem independent of the governing bodyI think it shows there are options we can have for kids  be able  play at a very very high level Ridpath said These kids dont have  be NCAA students for it  actually be a viable commercial productThere is indeed a viable commercial element Tracey Thompson executive direcr of the Kutzwn University foundation said the passion and support from former players had been strong enough  prompt a spinoff outlet Rug United which raises money for the club team Rug merchandise is sold in the university booksre and with each game from the college championships broadcast on national television Kutzwns national profile is growingIt is moneymaking for the university said Hawkinson the Kutzwn president Not only with the tuition that the students pay but also the money raised thanks  alumni support for the schoolFrom 1986  1998 Jones said he paid for most of the programs needs out of his pocket But in recent years the program proved  the university that it was a worthwhile investmentThe university saw the value in really investing in a club that could recruit internationally and all over the country said Amy Sandt Kutzwns direcr of recreational servicesShe said the clubs success had brought this tiny university name national recognition That was really where the value was seen We can now reach out  a larger network of people  expand our nameThe teams success has not hurt either Kutzwn lost  Cal in the national title game in 2014 and 2015 and produced a member of the USA Rug team that played in the 2015 World Cup Niku KrugerAny school can do what we did Hawkinson said if you have the right combination of great great coaches and a very supportive universityDan Payne the chief executive of USA Rug has experienced this firsthand When he was the coach at Life University a small NAIA school outside Atlanta he established a program that could hold its own on the national level and attract international talentThe Running Eagles reached the final of the CRC this year where they lost  Cal The competition between clubs he said is raising every teams level of playTheres a much stronger approach  what consists of your daily training environment he said With the increased competition it becomes contagiousFor the most part the Collegiate Rug Championship looks like any NCAA urnament with sponsors and vendors selling 30 Tshirts Major conference club teams like UCLA Wisconsin and Clemson were represented this year but so were clubs like Arkansas State St Marys of California Lindenwood from Missouri and American International College from MassachusettsThere was a concurrent 16team womens championship The NCAA considers womens rug an emerging sport especially for colleges looking  comply with Title IX deficienciesThere was also one noticeable difference Alcohol sales prohibited at many NCAA sites were strong Irish whiskey a

sevens a more open style of the sport that was reintroduced in the Olympics for 2016 after a 92year hiatus Featuring seven players  a side and sevenminute halves it is fast frenetic and  its promoters hope  more appealing  younger generations than the more physical more plodding version of the traditional 15on15 gameThe action is almost nonsp and for the uninitiated it can be hard  follow As Kutzwn was running up the score against Tennessee on Saturday an administrar was trying  ss Tshirts  fans in the stands after each tryWere going  run out of shirts Thompson saidJones had said beforehand that this was one of the best teams he had coached Though comparisons could be made  the NCAA basketball urnament Kutzwn no longer felt like a Cinderella when it faced a powerhouse like Cal which beat Kutzwns lden Bears in the quarterfinals on SundayYears ago we really wanted  prove ourselves said Chester the assistant coach We wanted  prove that this brand was important We went in with that mindset as an underdog We dont think that anymoreDavid Snead a Kutzwn senior from Oxford England summed up how things had changed in the just the few years since he arrivedWhen youre looking  play

Russian ballet dancers Cuban baseball players and Chinese political dissidents These are the kind of people fleeing persecution in their homelands who typically won asylum in the United States over the yearsIn many cases they were in the country for a theatrical performance a conference or a sports urnament then sought refuge Think Martina Navratilova the Czech tennis player who defected during the 1975 US OpenOver the past five years though the number of asylum applications has skyrocketed Civil wars in Africa gang violence in Central America and government crackdowns in China have contributed  a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases and processing times of up  six years This presents a range of challenges  US authorities who are required under international law  give all of the cases careful considerationHeres a look at how we got here and what Americas legal obligations areThe goal is  provide a safe haven for those who can prove they are fleeing persecution in their homelandThere are two ways people can win protection and the right  live permanently in the United States In both cases they must prove the same wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social groupPeople who apply and are selected overseas eventually enter the United States as refugeesMany of them hundreds of thousands remain parked in camps as the refugee application process unfolds typically over several years That process involves several interviews with United Nations and American officials The United States also conducts several layers of security screeningPeople already on United States soil apply for asylumAlexander dunov a principal dancer with the renowned Bolshoi Ballet was granted asylum in the United States in 1979 He was the first of several dancers  defect from the Bolshoi during that years ur in the United States He requested asylum in New York City and received it immediately Ms Navratilova received asylum in Ocber 1975 a month after filing for itDuring the 1980s civil war in El Salvador displaced several hundred thousand people Tens of thousands flocked  the United States and applied for political asylumNowadays the process of applying for asylum often takes years  complete from start  finish It involves interviews with United States immigration officials and often with immigration judgesWhether people entered the country legally or not they are eligible  apply for asylumThe world is suffering the worst refugee crisis since World War II There are now a staggering number of refugees asylumseekers and displaced people  about 50 millionViolence around the globe is pushing desperate people  seek safety across international borders People from the Middle East and Africa are taking rickety boats and making treacherous treks  reach Europe They are less likely  show up at the southwest border of the United States than people from Latin America who are relatively speaking near and can come over landIn recent years violence in Central America  it has some of the highest murder rates in the world  has prompted tens of thousands of people since 2014  make the perilous journey  the United StatesThe migrants either turn themselves in at the border  American authorities or sneak in the country illegally Regardless they then declare that they are seeking asylumBefore 2011 only 1 percent of all arriving foreigners requested asylum Today one out of 10 apply according  government officialsJeff Sessions the United States Atrney General called the caravan now awaiting processing at the San Ysidro port of entry a deliberate attempt  undermine our laws and overwhelm our systemIndeed there are signs that the administration is seeking  disqualify certain applicants such as victims of domestic violence who have sometimes won asylum Recently Mr Sessions suggested they should not be eligibleYet the law does require authorities  accept and consider their petitionsOnce they are processed at the port of entry they are likely  be transferred  a detention facility where they must pass the first step in the asylum process a crediblefear interview with an officer of the United States Immigration and Citizenship ServicesThe number of crediblefear interviews conducted  the federal agency has soared from 5000 in 2007  80000 last yearMore than three quarters of those interviewed pass that screening and are referred  an immigration judge for hearings that may span months or longer Those who fail the interview can be deported immediatelyAsylum applicants awaiting a hearing before a judge either remain in detention or are released wearing a tracking device such as an ankle monir with a date  appear in courtMany Central Americans stay with friends and relatives who already live in the United States Once 180 days have passed after filing of their application they are eligible  work in the United States Their children attend public schoolsBecause some migrants in the past have skipped their court hearings Mr Trump has criticized the practice of releasing migrants describing it as catch and release In recent months his administration has ordered border officers  when possible keep these migrants in detention rather than release themWhile these asylum seekers are on paper eligible for consideration for release on parole in reality ICE holds them in detention for long periods of time said Eleanor Acer direcr of refugee protection for Human Rights FirstUnited States officials say the administration is trying  figure out how  deal with the surge in asylum applications in a manner that is consistent with its international obligationsPart of the problem is that immigration courts are clogged and not just with asylum casesCentral Americans who apply for asylum often have been threatened with death or suffered attacks at the hands of gangs Often mothers flee  protect their children from recruitmentWe have seen firsthand the extraordinarily violent conditions in the Northern Triangle of Central America that forces families and children  flee their homes in search of urgently needed safety in the US said Jennifer Sime senior vice president of United States programs at the International Rescue CommitteeThose who qualify and are fleeing violence who have no other route  protection should be granted safety and asylum she saidImmigrant advocates say their circumstances are akin  those faced  people escaping war in Syria or Somalia However it is more difficult for Central Americans  win their casesA huge percentage of these people get deported said Marty Rosenbluth an immigration atrney Its a really difficult struggle  win asylumMr Rosenbluth said that all of his asylum cases based on gang violence have failed because his clients could not establish that they fit in a social group suffering particular persecution  qualifyIn some cases judges have found that applicants fabricated or exaggerated their claims though that is not usually the caseImmigration court records show that more asylum cases were denied over the previous five years than have been granted In fiscal year 2016 62 percent of asylum cases were denied compared with 445 percent five years earlier Among Mexicans and Central Americans the approval rate is substantially lowerSimply wanting a better life does not meet the international criteria  qualify for asylum But there are people who apply anyway because it gives them some benefits albeit temporarily even if they ultimately lose their caseSince the election of Mr Trump undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for many years and fear deportation have been applying for asylum knowing that they are unlikely  win but hoping  remain in the country

NonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site we earn an affiliate commissionJames Andrew Millers Powerhouse The Unld Sry of Hollywoods Creative Artists Agency has a terrific subject for a sprawling narrative since CAA has been at the vortex of Hollywood and commerce for more than four decades The sry has great characters plenty of boldface names and surprising twistsAlmost any of Shakespeares political tragedies or comedies could serve as road maps  the backstage drama surrounding CAA through the decades Miller writes CAA long ago ceased  be a traditional talent agency and what started out as a television representation business had since spiraled in movies music investment banking advertising marketing and most recently sportsAs in his previous books with a coauthor Tom Shales Live From New York about Saturday Night Live and Those Guys Have All the Fun ESPN Miller is mostly an invisible hand Powerhouse is largely a series of direct quotations strung gether in more or less chronological and pical order While I wouldnt go so far as  call the sry unld many of the key events were widely reported and written about Miller has done an extraordinary number of interviews more than 500 he says and simply organizing and piecing gether this wealth of material is a feat Even more impressive is Millers ability  get nearly everyone involved not only  talk but also  go on the record which is remarkable given the norious culture of secrecy in HollywoodStill there are drawbacks  this approach Few sources are naturally good srytellers even in the entertainment business Its hard for Miller  build up much narrative steam and just when he gets it going someone rambles off on a tangent Some sections are filled with tedious details only an insider could appreciateThere are o many sources doubling as characters and o many walkon appearances You get a sense of what youre in for when the cast of characters at the front of the book runs  11 singlespaced doublecolumned pagesTransitions are nonexistent jarring or confusing At times Miller has  abandon the quotations and supply some muchneeded connective tissue This is also an inefficient way  tell a sry  Id estimate a more conventional narrative could have done the job in half the books 700plus pages But for readers with the patience  sift through all this semiraw material Powerhouse delivers a chronicle of vaunting ambition immense wealth and power and personal betrayal all the more asnishing in a business ostensibly built on loyalty and trustMichael Ovitz and Ron Meyer the most important of the five cofounders of CAA loom large as both quoted sources and the most fully developed and fascinating characters They had a remarkably close and symbiotic relationship Meyer warm and affable Ovitz cerebral and ugh I didnt trust anyone in my life more than Ron Meyer  no one except for maybe my wife Ovitz saysThey had help from others but it was their fierce determination hard work and singleminded devotion  clients and CAA that turned a fledgling talent agency in an entertainment colossus Its no wonder being an agent is a young persons job The actress Ali MacGraw packed her suitcase and walked out of a passionate romance with Meyer when he wouldnt get off the phone with a client early one Saturday morning He says he doesnt blame herOvitz was once widely acknowledged as the most powerful man in Hollywood perhaps the most powerful business person in Hollywood ever at his peak even President Clinn was eating out of his hand When Earvin Magic Johnson suggested Ovitz might someday run a studio he replied Earvin I dont have  run a studio I run them all now anywayThen Ovitz overreached and fell ignobly  earth He blew opportunities  run two major studios  Universal and Sony   making outrageous demands for aunomy and compensation But why wouldnt he have Hed built a career on outrageous demands  for both himself and his clients  and they were invariably metAfter CAA orchestrated the wildly successful 1993 polar bear ad campaign for CocaCola a senior Coke executive put a 10 million check payable  Ovitz in the hands of a y polar bear and had it delivered  the company Ovitz returned the check unendorsed with a sticky note Lets discuss this Ovitz eventually got 31 millionIn 1995 Meyer was sent  Ovitz  New York  meet Edgar Bronfman Jr the Seagrams heir and chief executive who had just gained control of Universal and  salvage Ovitzs shot at running the studio Meyer emerged with the job himself Thats when Ron lost me as a friend Judy Ovitz says He turned around and ok the job that should have gone  Michael Ovitz who never missed an hour let alone a day of work was so stunned and depressed people said that he didnt come in the office for a weekWith Meyer out and a new generation at CAA  the socalled Young Turks  chafing  take over Ovitzs days at the agency he founded were numbered In his own telling he was burned outFor an exit commensurate with his stature Ovitz accepted an offer from Michael Eisner  be president of Disney After Meyer Ovitz probably considered Eisner his best friend and their two families had been close for years Ovitz thought  erroneously  theyd be running the company as equals Eisner fired Ovitz after little more than a yearA measure of Ovitzs power was the vindictiveness with which former friends and colleagues greeted his downfall  none more so than his successors at CAA As Miller puts it Just about anybody in Hollywood with a tripledigit IQ heard firsthand or remotely about how much the Young Turks resented and even hated him This seems especially ungrateful since Ovitz had paid them lavishly handed them clients built the agency and then sold it  them for the bargain price of 175 million By 2010 it was valued at 700 millionTrue the Turks  Kevin Huvane Bryan Lourd Richard Lovett Jay Moloney and David OConnor  thought theyd been lied  or misled about matters large and small who earned what whether CAA owned a private jet who had an equity stake in CAAs headquarters building But none of that seems adequate  explain the intensity of their resentment which the more genial Meyer seems  have escaped Miller speculates The Young Turks were prodigal sons with the agency functioning like the trust fund a rich kid gets when turning 25But the Turks seem  have risen  the challenge They had  cope not only with the inevitable upheavals that accompany succession but also with tecnic changes in the entertainment business starting with the collapse of the DVD market and the withering of revenues from feature films which once contributed the major portion of CAAs profitsThese new leaders had  rethink the nature of the agency business pushing boldly beyond marketing and investment banking the expanded boundaries Ovitz and Meyer had laid down Its hard  manage change of that magnitudeFor CAA the biggest financial change came in 2010 when it sold a 35 percent stake  one of the biggest and most successful private equity firms TPG Capital for 166 million TPG got a majority share four years later in a financing deal that raised another 435 million which lifted the value of CAA  more than 1 billion The infusion of capital enabled the company  become a principal  not just an intermediary   investing its own capital in projectsIts o soon  know how thats going  turn out We may find out if and when CAA is sold again or goes public which for a private equity firm like TPG would typically be seven  nine years after making the investmentMiller suggests CAAs best days are behind it Today only three of the Young Turks remain at the firm Moloney the one closest  Ovitz who had been viewed as his chosen successor died in 1999 after struggling with cocaine addiction apparently  suicide After 32 years at CAA OConnor left in 2015  become chief executive of Madison Square GardenCAA is now big and impersonal and focused on the botm line which seems  have taken a lot of the fun out of being an agent there not  mention reading about them Even so if money and power are the measure of success in Hollywood then access  the hundreds of millions in capital TPG delivered gives CAA the potential  be far more powerful than anything Ovitz and Meyer ever envisionedBut money and power may not be the only or even best measure of success in Hollywood Perhaps Im nave but I came away from the book with the sense that CAAs most enduring legacy will be the impact its agents had on the lives and careers of their many clients amply documented in Powerhouse The best of the entertainment they created will be remembered long after CAA is goneI think its a ghastly way  make a living Ali MacGraw says of the agent business But if youre really good at it like Ron was you must gain some tremendous happiness  changing peoples lives so dramaticallyOvitz may still be reviled  some but not his clients Ive never known anybody like Mike Ovitz David Letterman says There is nobody like him He was such an overwhelming positive force and in show business there are not many positive forces He put me back on my feet Its comparable  my heart surgery

On SoccerMOSCOW  Half a million fans   current suspiciously optimistic estimates  will descend on Russia next year for what Gianni Infantino the FIFA president has already decreed will be the best World Cup in hisryEvery single fan he has decided will have an amazing experience Billions of dollars have been spent on new or renovated stadiums  host the finest players in the world Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi Neymar and Kylian Mbapp Russias president Vladimir Putin on Friday promised a major sporting festival of friendship and fair playAnd now at last we know how it will all kick off This great celebration of soccer this eradefining event the most watched sporting event in the world will get underway at Moscows Luzhniki Stadium on June 14 with the almost elemental collision of the 63rd and 65thbest teams the planet can offerApplause rippled across the floor of the hall at the Kremlin State Palace when it was confirmed that Saudi Arabia  officially the weakest of all the teams who had  qualify for next years World Cup according  FIFAs rankings  would face Russia officially the weakest of all the teams in next years World Cup in the urnaments opening gameIt might have been relief from the locals in the crowd of course there has been no little concern here that Russias team is so poor that it might do what the revelations of the ongoing FIFA corruption trial in New York and the allegations of widespread statesponsored doping could not make Putin regret bringing the World Cup here in the first placeStill the applause felt odd misplaced By almost any measure RussiaSaudi Arabia is an anticlimax of an opening game the weakest in terms of the rankings of the two teams in World Cup hisry It is not the sort of game that lived up  the absurd gaudy pomp of the ceremony that preceded it complete with a traditional Russian dance troupeBut it is fitting given how the rest of the draw panned out For the first time FIFA had changed the way the World Cup groups were drawn pooling teams according  their ranking rather than on a geographical basis The moves main effect was  protect most of the urnament favorites from meeting one anotherIndeed only in two groups are notional heavyweights drawn gether Spain meets Portugal in Group B while Belgium encounters England in Group G The prospect of drama in either group though was quelled when the identities of their other opponents were revealed Spain and Portugal will expect  get past Morocco and Iran England and Belgium should be o strong for Tunisia and Panama a World Cup debutante In the headhead games nobody should suffer a knockout blowFrance Brazil and Germany did even better It is a convention among athletes and coaches alike that you never risk belittling an opponent  pretty much every coach who faced the news media after the draw uttered some variation on the phrase there is no such thing as an easy game  but for those three in particular it must have been tempting  break itAll three have precisely the sorts of groups that they would have drawn for themselves Peru Australia and Denmark for the French Serbia Switzerland and Costa Rica for Brazil Mexico Sweden and South Korea in with the reigning champion GermanyOf all the p seeds in fact only Argentina had cause  leave Moscow a little dispirited Jorge Sampaolis team stuttered through qualifying its fearsome attack blunted surprisingly  and troublingly  easily until Lionel Messi conjured a hat trick in Ecuador  ensure his country would go  Russia Still its fragile confidence could have done without the prospect of Croatia Nigeria and Iceland lurking in Group DThat such a lineup could constitute the ughest of all the groups is indicative of the other major change  one not effected at least directly  FIFA  that influenced the way the draw played outQualifying for this urnament proved decisively that there has been a shift in the nature of international soccer Italy the Netherlands Chile and the United States are not here Iceland Peru and Panama are Major nations can no longer coast in the World Cup Smaller countries with a decent crop of players a gifted coach and a sense of purpose can overturn the oddsThe change has made for some wonderful sries over the last two years but this was its flip side a urnament short on groups of death and seismic encounters between superpowersAs Gareth Southgate the England manager rightly said it is when the draw is over that everything comes alive It is when fans start  map out where their team will go and whom it might face in the knockout rounds when a blackandwhite urnament is flooded with colorThis is a little different The 2018 World Cup has the look of a slowburner The first two weeks will be intriguing rather than explosive some of the lesser lights will have a moment  shine Only in the latter stages will the fireworks start FIFA is unlikely  object  a urnament that if things go  form could throw up quarterfinals between Portugal and France Brazil and England Spain and Argentina and Germany and ColombiaIt is an approach with just one attendant danger All urnaments hinge on how the host country copes when its team is eliminated If it loses interest the event itself can lose some of its fizzThat is a particular risk with Russia where official support for the World Cup is rooted in a desire  project national pride and power  the world If that wanes the electricity of the urnament might go with it Russia is warm and welcoming Infantino said Everyone will be able  celebrate football with the Russian people The question apart from what everyone means is how long that will lastSo perhaps the applause that greeted confirmation of the opening game was not from the Russians but from FIFA Russia is in a group with Saudi Arabia Egypt and Uruguay Not a cakewalk  any means but not a Calvary either Enough certainly  reassure the host that it will not be thrown out of its own party o earlyCollapse,sports

CLEVELAND  The final out nestled in the glove of the visiting first baseman who raised both arms  the air in triumph The series was over and his team had reached new heights He vowed  keep the ball as a symbol of the achievementThat scene played out last fall in Cleveland with Anthony Rizzo of the Chicago Cubs who ultimately presented the ball  the owner Tom Ricketts at a championship parade with millions of revelers Before that though it had also happened in Toron with Carlos Santana of the Indians He caught the foul pop that clinched the Indians first American League pennant in 19 years It signified the possibility of the franchises first World Series title in decadesThe Indians of course came up one run short losing in the 10th inning of Game 7 of the World Series Santana keeps his lasut ball at his home here so his family can see it He sres his AL championship ring in a safeI dont want that  I want the big one like champions Santana said on Friday  his locker at Progressive Field I felt last year like a champion because we were fighting till the last out Last year was very special but the team this year is much betterThe Indians improved  eight games over last season finishing 10260  earn homefield advantage through the American League Championship Series It was only the third 100win season in franchise hisry after 1954 and 1995 the bookend years of a fourdecade stretch without a postseason appearanceThe Indians pursuit will not grip the sports world the way the Cubs did Sixtynine years is a long time but it is hardly a century of pain Players know it has been a while but the teams rtured hisry is more of a vague concept than a burden They do not expect it  resonate nationallyEighty years 69 years  whats another decade or so when the Indians have waited this long The fans at least for now seem upbeat While the Indians still ranked near the botm in AL attendance they sold more than two million tickets for the first time in nine years And NFL misery notwithstanding the Cavaliers 2016 NBA title may have changed the sports outlook around wnThis is my 29th year and this is the only community Ive ever known that had phrases  describe every failed championship said Tom Hamiln the Indians longtime broadcaster You know the Drive the Fumble the Shot the Ninth Inning with Jose Mesa and the Marlins It almost seemed like people perpetuated that misery I dont want  say they enjoyed it but it was always a badge of honor The Cavs eliminated some of thatThe Indians did their part o The seventh game against the Cubs will be remembered as a classic but for most of the night it wasnt The Indians never led and they were trailing 63 against Aroldis Chapman in the botm of the eighth inning Had they lost  that score Hamiln said the sting of botching a threegamesone lead might have felt worseAfter a lackluster first half the Indians have soared through the last two and a half months They finished the season on a 324 tear and trailed for only eight innings of their ALrecord 22game winning streak from Aug 24 through Sept 14 They outscored opponents  254 runs for the season the best run differential in the majors and the franchise high since that charmed summer of 1948The length of the lineup and the depth of the team was a bit eyeopening  me said right fielder Jay Bruce who arrived from the Mets in an early August trade Its like wow this isnt just the nine guys on the field theres like 15 other guys who are quality and solid That was the biggest thing during the streak Some of our best players were hurt and it was just like next man upAfter Barlo Colon anchored three playoff rotations the Indians traded him  Montreal in 2002 for a package including a young Cliff Lee Seven years later after Lee had won a Cy Young Award they dealt him  Philadelphia for a prospect haul that brought Carlos Carrasco who was 186 with a 329 earned run average this season Other highimpact players  Santana Corey Kluber Trevor Bauer Michael Brantley  have come in similar dealsLast month on a West Coast trip the president of baseball operations Chris Annetti left the major league team for a fourday visit  the instructional league in Arizona He huddled with lieutenants for workshops on how  improve the organization and visited prospects on the botm rung of the minor league ladderIts a really important group  spend time with said Annetti who estimated that about 70 percent of the teams innings pitched and plate appearances came from players who had spent time in the Cleveland farm systemWe continue  push ourselves and never be complacent Annetti said We realize how difficult it is  succeed at the major league level and win and how fragile success can be so we have  pay constant attention  it And sometimes even with those best efforts you fall shortWhen they fell short last year the Indians did something unusual They spent big signing Edwin Encarnacion  a threeyear 60 million freeagent contract the richest in team hisry For players still processing the heartbreak of Game 7 the deal was a jolt that reinforced the urgency of the momentEncarnacion a former Blue Jay has helped them do it  leading the team in homers 38 and RBI 107 Jose Ramirez and Lindor combined for a staggering 172 extrabase hits and only the Housn Astros had a better onbase plus slugging percentage than Clevelands 788I was fortunate  get back when I did because I was able  pitch backback and go multiple innings and check those boxes Miller said Ive gotten a lot stronger and my sympms are next  nothing I feel like I can go out there and do whatever I need At the same time were a deeper bullpenThe presence of Carrasco who did not pitch last postseason after a line drive broke his hand also makes the rotation deeper And besides the ankle problems of Brantley  who also missed the last postseason with shoulder trouble  the only cause for concern may be that Bauers drone has gone missingI have  build a new one night Bauer said on Friday after his 17th vicry I have all my supplies Maybe Ill post a video so everyone can watchThat bullpen game was so much fun because everybodys involved Manager Terry Francona said I loved itThe Indians were on the road that night already leading the series and facing a thunderous Blue Jays lineup That game more than any other highlighted just how unpredictable the postseason can be Sometimes bad breaks can be funNow the Indians are the ALs best team perhaps the best in baseball with expectations  match The best team does not always win it all  and for almost seven decades the Indians have not either But they will eagerly try againReally nobody else can draw off what we went through Miller said Hopefully we can use that fuel and get one more winCollapse,sports

PERUGIA Italy  In early 2015 three members of the Liverpool scouting department visited the offices of ISM Academy a small soccer training school in Corciano just west of here  speak with a promising teenage strikerAt some point during the visirs pitch Barry Hunter Liverpools chief scout casually namedropped Steven Gerrard the longtime Liverpool captain perhaps as a way  impress the young player The reference was met with a confused stareWho is Gerrard the teenage striker saidNow it was Hunter who seemed confused As the other men in the room fidgeted in their seats Hunter reached for his computer and pulled up images of Gerrard one of the most famous players of his era and attempted  explain who he wasThis is a bit of an awkward situation Alessandro Dominici 50 the direcr of the academy said as he recalled the meetingBut maybe it should not have been a surprise Most of the time the striker Han Kwangsong seems like any other teenage soccer prospect from any other country But from time  time there are moments when it becomes strikingly clear that he is notHan now 19 is North Korean He arrived in Italy three years ago through an idiosyncratic arrangement between ISM and the North Korean soccer federation that has brought dozens of the hermetic nations most promising young players  CorcianoThis auspicious form has earned Han the attention of even more big clubs It has also raised the eyebrows of some members of the Italian parliament who last year initiated an inquiry in the legal status of another young North Korean product of ISM and who continue  wonder whether the players are free from the control of their government or if their mere employment violates longstanding international sanctions against North KoreaHans young career then has felt like an experiment in which the range of outcomes has yet  be fully considered What would happen if an athlete from North Korean achieved success and stardom  and riches  in sports What would that players life look like And how would that player and his or her employers navigate the complex tangle of geopolitical tensions that accompany the countrys every moveIt was 2012 when officials of North Koreas soccer federation which is known as PRKFA first approached Annio Razzi a longtime member of Italys parliament seeking help placing young soccer players in ItalyRazzi is known here and sometimes criticized for his congenial stance ward Pyongyang He has made 10 diplomatic visits  North Korea and in an interview recently he repeated regime talking points  Theres no unemployment that Ive seen  and described its capital as the New York of AsiaIn the North Koreans view then Razzi was the perfect person  help broker an agreement Through a chain of personal contacts he connected the soccer officials with ISM which they liked because of its proximity  the North Korean embassy in Rome In 2013 the federation sent a group of boys ages 10 and 13  Corciano but ISM deemed them  be o young for the academy So a year later Dominici and Luis Pomares a coach at ISM joined Razzi and a group of Italian politicians and entrepreneurs on a diplomatic trip  North Korea where they ured the national sports facilities and scouted some players That was when they first saw Han playWe sort of looked at each other and said Where did this kid come from  Dominici saidFifteen North Korean boys including Han joined ISM that year The North Koreans initially had a second partnership with an academy in Barcelona called Fundacin Marcet but that relationship dissolved after a year according  Dominici Today ISM has an exclusive contract with the North Korean federation  train its prospects and scouts from the academy travel  Pyongyang once a year  help pick the next crop of playersChrispher Green who has interviewed more than 350 North Korean defecrs as part of his research on the political landscape of the country said that even physical education classes in the countrys schools began placing a greater emphasis on soccer in recent years North Korea has always had an interest in developing sporting talent  thats not new  but the focus on football seems  be new Green saidLike others with a sck in Hans success Passetti played down the importance of Hans heritageHe is a really good kid who behaves and carries out a life like all young athletes entering the professional sports world with friends away from the field and profiles on social media Passetti said in an email Nationality has never been a criterion that would determine the signing or not of a playerBut some wonder if it should beIn May 2016 two members of the Italian Parliaments Chamber of Deputies Michele Nicoletti and Lia Quartapelle initiated a formal request that the Italian government investigate the contract and the status of Choe Songhyok a North Korean product of ISM Academy who had just signed with FiorentinaTheir concerns Nicoletti said in an interview were twofold First they asked whether any transfer of money  at any point  had violated international sanctions banning payments  North Korea Second they wondered whether Choes human rights were being restricted in any wayIn 2014 a report commissioned  the United Nations Human Rights Council had unequivocally stated that a broad catalog of human rights was being egregiously violated  the North Korean government Those abuses  including restrictions on personal liberties strict state surveillance and the seizure of as much as 90 percent of an individuals wages  often extended  an estimated 100000 North Koreans working outside the countryThat is why in July the United States secretary of state Rex Tillerson said that any country hosting North Korean workers was aiding and abetting a dangerous regimeExperts say North Korea has sent more workers abroad  fulfill an urgent need back home for hard currency But in this context a star athlete offers something unique a potential vessel of soft power a rarity for the North Korean government Remco Breuker a professor of Korean Studies at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands said that if Han or another player were  achieve soccer stardom politically the payout would be huge for North KoreaThe Italian governments inquiry ultimately cleared the contract between Fiorentina and Choe after determining that his salary was being paid  a bank account in his name The question of whether his personal freedoms were being violated was more complicated The government can investigate only a specific complaint from a party  the relationship  like the player or his club  and since no one had made one it could not pursue any actionNevertheless Fiorentina canceled Choes contract and dropped its interest in HanIn an interview though Quartapelle said she felt compelled  continue  monir the situation if only because there was still so little known about Han and the other players The impression that many of us have is that there really isnt all of this freedom she saidPerugia said Han and Choe who signed with the club after leaving Fiorentina were not available  be interviewed for this article The North Korean soccer federation did not respond  an email requesting information about the players and Sandro Stemperini who has represented Han and Choe as an agent since earlier this year declined  commentOn Sept 3 after scoring two goals in Perugias 42 win over Pescara Han made a brief and awkward appearance on Sky Serie B a soccer analysis program  appearing on a big screen in the studio as the broadcasters peppered him with questions After Han goodnaturedly answered a few in his limited Italian Gianluca Di Marzio one of the analysts called out What do they say of you in North KoreaHans expression suddenly became serious No sorry he said before chuckling apologetically I dont want  speakThe segment came  an abrupt endJust over two weeks later Han was scheduled  appear on another program La Domenica Sportiva alongside Massimiliano Sanpadre the president of the Perugia club but at the appointed time only Sanpadre showed up  the set The programs hosts  and subsequently other members of the Italian news media  wondered whether the North Korean government had blocked the players appearanceSanpadre tried  shoot down that speculation saying Han was merely shy We live in a free country and if one of my players asks that he not be interviewed I cannot oblige him  do otherwise Sanpadre said in an interview with The New York TimesPerugia though is a world away from PyongyangThe North Korean players at the academy  there are 12 this year registered as being born in 1999 and 2000  live alongside others in their age group at the dormiries of the Convit Nazionale Principe di Napoli Assisi a boarding school in a near wn They sleep three  a room take classes in the morning and train every afternoon The cost for each of the 90 or so students at the academy is about 16000 euros for a ninemonth season about 18850 which the North Korea soccer federation covers for its playersThe federation also sends an adult supervisor  live with the players While Han was at ISM that person was Yon Kwangmu who at the time was the coach of North Koreas under17 national teamThe adjustment process for the boys can be difficult with food a major hangup Han and the other North Korean players for example often begged the coaches  drive them  a sushi restaurant  sate a taste of Asian cuisine and Dominici said the embassy officials who frequently drove up from Rome  check on the prospects delivered familiar comfort foods like kimchiBreuker the professor at the University of Leiden said that North Koreans overseas often had their personal freedoms explicitly limited and that even diplomats and academics abroad felt the intense weight of the countrys political apparatus whether through mandated selfcriticism sessions or outright surveillance  government officialsBut Dominici said the school had not been asked  impose and did not otherwise know of any restrictions on the freedom of the North Korean players at his academyTV cellphones YouTube added Pomares the ISM coach They have access  everythingHan now shares an apartment near Perugias training facility with Choe Sanpadre said and enjoys playing video games He even plans  get his drivers licenseI can guarantee that Han carries out a normal life Sanpadre said He has his own cellphone and like all other 19yearolds he always has his phone in his handThe North Korean teenagers may seem unknowable through their veil of privacy but they are professional athletes and glimpses of their lives peek through One afternoon this fall Choe and Luciano Mancini the coach of Perugias youth team sat gether at a restaurant near the teams training facility where a New York Times reporter was already seated for lunch Mancini gave Choe a pep talk about his play He asked the teenager about his family back home Choe who gave mostly monosyllabic answers in Italian ordered only a plate of sausagesIn moments of silence the men looked up at a television set  a sports news programHan with his strong play has ventured more completely in the spotlight Last month he traveled with Perugia  Brescia in northern Italy  play his last match before joining North Koreas national team for a pair of international gamesFrom the opening whistle Han menaced the Brescia defense making multiple dribbling runs from Perugias own half of the field He looked at once eager and assured His red uniform hung loosely off his slender body but he showed surprising strength and power with larger opponents ricocheting off his bodyIn the second half Han swooped through Brescias penalty area and scored on a powerful headerHe hurdled the advertising boards and sprinted with his arms raised ward the southwest corner of the stadium where a few hundred traveling Perugia fans had been sequestered After soaking in their cheers Han ran back  the teams bench where he gave the manager a spirited highfiveThere was a huge smile on his face and for a moment he looked like any other teenager from any other countryBrando de Leonardis contributed reportingvideoCollapse,sports

did Jones really do at the Mets old ballpark He hit 313 with 19 home runs his most in any visiting stadium and then added three homers at Citi Field Impressive for sure but Jones actually did even more damage in Philadelphia he hit 350 with 13 home runs at Veterans Stadium and connected 11 more times at Citizens Bank ParkJust a few whiffcrazy years since his retirement its striking  see a career like Lees in 14 seasons as a power hitter he never struck out 100 times Thats the kind of steady forceful contact we see from few sluggers besides Albert Pujols who led the majors in runs

AVONDALE La  On April 19 2016 Andy Pazder was sipping a cup of coffee reading the sports page and soaking in the ocean view just a few miles from PGA Tour headquarters in Florida when the idea struck himHe wanted  shake up the format of the Zurich Classic of New Orleans a ur staple since 1938 In that moment of inspiration Pazder the urs chief urnaments and competitions officer thought about switching the Classic from a traditional strokeplay event  a twoman team eventHe fired off a text at 612 am explaining his idea  Jay Monahan who in November would be promoted  ur commissioner Then he looked up the website of the title sponsor Zurich Insurance Group which listed teamwork among the companys core valuesIt was like a gift Pazder saidPazders idea required the approval of the title sponsor and of the urs board of direcrs and it received universal support During the initial discussion with the urs 16member Player Advisory Council Pazder said there were guys looking  pair up on the spotWith the new format the Zurich Classic seems  have been jolted  enthusiasmSix of the p 10 players in the rankings and 13 of the p 25 signed up  play this week During the postMasters hangover the past two weeks none of the players then in the p 15 competed in the RBC Heritage and only one played in the Texas OpenThe Zurich Classic will feature 80 twoman teams with those posting the p 35

awarded a twoyear ur exemption 400 FedEx Cup points and invitations  the Players Championship next month the PGA Championship in August and the Tournament of Champions in January But the winning

in a statement this year We are in the entertainment content business with golf as our platform and lfSixes is the perfect illustration of thatTeam golf is not a novel concept Among other events the

team events using various formatsThe ur also recognizes two nontraditional events the World lf Championships matchplay urnament and the Barracuda Championship which uses a modified Stableford format allocating points based on the number of strokes taken at each hole with the goal of achieving the highest overall scoreShould there be more breaks with tradition It depends whom you ask Jordan Spieth campaigned for a couple of more breaks from the monony of 72hole stroke play while Justin Rose supported the philosophy of if it aint broke dont fix itIve always believed that 72hole stroke play is the purest form of the game and thats how you often get the best champion and the truest winner Rose said That should be protected I think for the most partThere were gaps on the European Tour schedule where there were opportunities  do something different and strengthen weaker urnaments  creating more fun and excitement around them I think theyve done a great job of identifying those urnaments But theyre not messing with the strong urnaments on the European TourThis week Spieth will play with his fellow Texan Ryan Palmer after losing a golf bet in November with Palmers caddie James Edmondson a former college golfer There also are pairings of brothers Brooks and Chase Koepka Ryder Cup teammates Rose and Henrik Stenson and college teammates the local favorites John Peterson and Andrew Loupe from Louisiana State Georgias Harris English and Hudson Swafford and Georgia Techs Ollie Schniederjans and Richy Werenski  name a few The highestprofile team is Jason Day and Rickie

DesperationBubba Watson who is playing with J B Holmes said It really doesnt matter how they partner up Theyre going  be buddies for a couple days and youre going  see a lot of smiles a lot of laughing and a lot of enjoyment of the game of golfThe NBC golf analyst Peter Jacobsen played on two Ryder Cup teams for the United States and was Arnold Palmers partner as host of the Fred Meyer Challenge an unofficial team event held from 1986  2002 Jacobsen described the team format as twice the pleasure but also twice the painIts so uplifting when you make a birdie for your partner he said but also agonizing when you miss a putt that costs you and your partner a holeThe new team format brings a different strategy and intrigue  the decisionmaking process which explains why so many players are talking about the importance of team chemistry and complementing each others game That could be either a blessing or a burden for the KoepkasWe could kill each other on the second hole

OBERSTDORF Germany  The next effort  defuse the nuclear brinksmanship over North Koreas missile and bomb testing may come not from diplomats but from a pair of North Korean figure skaters who perform  music  the BeatlesAn obscure competition on Thursday and Friday here in Bavaria has gained geopolitical urgency as the pairs team of Ryom Taeok and Kim Jusik seek  become the first North Korean athletes  qualify for the 2018 Winter Olympics in February in Pyeongchang South KoreaWere aware there is a lot of interest Kim Hyonson who coaches the pair said after a training session on Wednesday speaking briefly through an interpreterDespite the nuclear tests missile launches and other saberrattling threats North Korea has signaled recently that it would consider participating in the Games Its fourperson skating delegation here appears somewhat guarded but approachable and friendlyAnd no one would be more relieved  a North Korean triumph of sequins and Salchows this week than the International Olympic Committee and South Korean officials They have stated adamantly and repeatedly a desire  have North Korea one of the worlds most isolated countries compete in what is being promoted as the Games of PeaceWhile the Olympics have been tainted  staggering costs and endemic corruption they still strive for the ideal that sport can bring people gether even as governments remain hostile and apartAt the United Nations last week Moon Jaein the president of South Korea called North Koreas aggressive behavior extremely deplorable But he has promoted diplomacy with the North and opposes military action Mr Moon struck a cautiously hopeful ne at a ceremony  unveil the design of the 2018 Olympic medals at the Metropolitan Museum of ArtSouth Korea would embark on a difficult but meaningful challenge in seeking  have a tranquil Games with North Korea participating he said in a speechIf North Korean athletes fail  qualify Olympic officials have said they will consider wildcard entries for North Korean athletes  encourage the country  participate A plan  have a delegation of North Korean athletes and officials march through the demilitarized zone  the Games as a peace gesture remains under considerationTensions are high now but because of that peace is all the more needed Mr Moon said If the two Koreas come gether at this point in time it will become a great opportunity  send a message of reconciliation and peace  the worldHe added I do not think it is impossibleChang Ung an IOC delegate from North Korea ld the Olympic committees online television channel in midSeptember I am quite sure that politics is one thing and Olympics is another thing So I dont see any big problem for the Pyeongchang OlympicsThe easiest route is for athletes from North Korea  qualifyFrom midJune through midAugust the North Korean pair of Ms Ryom 18 and Mr Kim 25 trained in Montreal refining their attempt  claim one of five Olympic spots available here at this weeks Nebelhorn Trophy competitionThe skaters their coach and a North Korean skating official spoke frequently about the Olympics said Bruno Marcotte a prominent French Canadian coach who worked with the pairAll the time they would ask me Do you think we have a chance  qualify Are we good enough What do we need  qualify Mr Marcotte said of the pair who aspire  become one of the worlds p 10 teamsThey didnt want  talk about politics said Mr Marcotte who is also here assisting the North Koreans It was all about sport and being the first ones in the Olympics and breaking barriers and doing their bestIt is a widely held feeling among South Korean politicians and Olympic officials as well as some international athletes that the Games would be safer with North Koreas participation lessening security concerns and perhaps spurring slow ticket salesIn that view Kim Jongun the unpredictable North Korean leader would be less likely  act provocatively if athletes from his country were competing in the Olympics alongside those of China North Koreas benefacrIts kind of an insurance policy  have them there said Ted Ligety a twotime gold medalist in Alpine skiing from the United StatesOf course there is no way  predict what the political situation will be on the Korean Peninsula in four months when the Olympics take place about 40 miles from the demilitarized zone that separates North and SouthAnd there is no guarantee that North Korea will participate It is not a winter sports power and did not compete at the 2014 Winter Games in Sochi Russia It also boycotted the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul the South Korean capitalA general wariness seems  be encroaching on these Games France has said its Olympic team will not travel  South Korea if its safety cannot be guaranteedStill Thomas Bach the president of the IOC has said there is so far not even a hint that security concerns related  North Korea threaten the Games In any case officials say it is o late  move the OlympicsThere is no Plan B said Anita DeFrantz a vice president of the IOC from the United StatesMr Chang the IOC delegate from North Korea has said its athletes will also attempt  qualify for the Games in shorttrack speedskating and Nordic skiing which includes crosscountry events According  Reuters North Korea has formally complained that international sanctions have interfered with its ability  purchase skiing equipment needed for trainingIn April North Korea sent its womens hockey team  play in South Korea In June it sent a taekwondo team That month South Koreas sports minister mentioned the possibility of fielding a combined hockey team in the Olympics and permitting North Korea  host an Alpine skiing eventThose prospects seem unlikely now South Korean Olympic and government officials said last week in New YorkNorth Korea is my biggest worry Choi Moonsoon the governor of Gangwon Province in South Korea where the 2018 Olympics will take place said in a recent interview Its not because of North Korea making an impact on the Olympics its that if North Korea can participate then it will make a great contribution for our goal of hosting a Peace Olympics and it will be a great selling pointIf North Korea does compete perhaps its most visible  and only  athletes will be Ms Ryom and Mr Kim They finished 15th at the 2017 world figure skating championships in March with a style influenced  classic Russian efficiency and precise placement of the arms and headDressed in silver and black costumes at training on Wednesday the pair skated  an instrumental version of the Beatles A Day in the Life as performed  Jeff Beck which will provide a musical backdrop for Thursdays opening performanceThe issue can be culturally sensitive At the world championships the North Koreans ended a brief interview with The Associated Press when asked how they had chosen the Beatles musicOn Wednesday Ms Ryom and her partner Mr Kim appeared smiling though slightly nervous during practice Trying  be o much Mr Marcotte said Still they received polite applause from the four dozen or so people who watched them train at the Eissportzentrum in this Alpine village with bell cows in the pastures and snow dusting the highest peaksIt is not uncommon for pairs skaters  have an artistically stressed relationship and as Mr Marcotte put it a coach can sometimes be more of a marriage counselor But the North Koreans remained unfailingly upbeat during their summer training he said And they even made kimchi a staple dish for a South Korean pair that he also trainedI think there is a will for friendship a will for peace Mr Marcotte said of the skaters They were so driven and so positive I didnt expect that They were sponges They wanted  learn so badlyMs Ryom and Mr Kim will be under enormous scrutiny and pressure this week  qualify for the Olympics But they also appear confident Mr Marcotte saidRi Cholun an official with the North Korean figure skating association said the pair might even speak  reporters on Friday after the pairs competition endsAs long as its about figure skating he saidKen Belson contributed reporting from Chuncheon South

Are you next reads a placard in a glass display case in Seouls Gwacheon ice rink where the next generation of Korean speedskaters take the ice each day  all dreaming of bringing home a medal in the

champions  build and rosters  fill for 2022 2026 and beyondTwo teenage boys each expecting  be part of the South Korean team at the 2022 Beijing Games zoomed around the old Gwacheon Ice Rink heads down moving as one As they leaned hard and pumped their legs around one tight corner a coach held a 9yearold girl standing on her skates  the arms With perfect timing he flung her on the ice like a fisherman casting a net in the seaThe rocket boost propelled her  speed and landed her in line with the boys as if they all wore magnets Three became one Around they wentLike the dozens of others who call the rink home they practice six days a week two or three hours each dayI have trained abroad said Lee SeungHwan the kidflinging coach and a member of South Koreas longtrack speedskating team at the 2002 Salt Lake Games I have never seen another country train its children as hard as we do here from the time they are very youngWith its single sheet of ice and pale yellow walls Gwacheon is one of three primary rinks in the Seoul area where young skaters are molded in championsIt is where the figure skater Yuna Kim the gold medalist in the 2010 Vancouver Games trained along with several p

the mustsee event of the Olympics and the names of its champions are carved deep in the collective memoryAt these Olympics South Korea won three of the eight events in shorttrack speedskating and six medals over all in the sport more than any other country Names like Choi Minjeong Shim Sukhee and Kim Alang all women and Lim Hyojun mens 1500 meter winner and silvermedalist Hwang Daeheon joined the

Netherlands had moreSouth Koreas success in skating is unusual because there are not a lot of rinks in the country  a couple dozen regularsized rinks plus one longtrack oval at Taereung National Training Center a vast multisport complex in Seoul The oval built in Gangneung for the Olympics about 100 miles away is expected  be converted in a convention centerIn a way its a good thing Lee the coach said Because of these limitations because of the small numbers we can really focus our support on these kids Maybe that is a secret  the successThe group at Gwacheon numbers more than 100 divided in A B and C groups depending on ability The C group is filled with young children fitted with helmets taught  crouch low  cross their right legs over their left and power through corners About three dozen are in the B group Five are in A including Lee Jinwoo 15 the p skater of his age in the countryWhen I see the Olympic athletes go on the podium  get their medals I feel very jealous in a good way he saidLee expects  forge his future in long track the same as Lee his coach they are not related did Choosing either short or long track can be difficult at a young age since almost all training of children is done on regularsized rinks like those used for hockey or figure skatingWe teach the power of how you skate the speed and control said Choi Sunghoon the manager of the physical education department at Gwacheon Ice RinkThe ability  navigate through crowds the willingness  bump and grind with other skaters in short track Choi said is something deep inside some skaters more than othersI think you are born with that skill he saidOutside his office groups of children jogged warmup laps up and down the hallway They crouched beside twofoot hurdles and when a coach ld them jumped over them and landed in a crouch againLee the coach wore a strap around his legs the kind one might use  strap cargo  a car roof and young skaters in the hall climbed inside the loop and leaned

across Seoul They make the trip two or three times a week practicing on the big oval with 200 or more other young skaters under the tutelage of about 30 coaches all hoping that they will be in the Olympics next time or the time after thatTight strings of skaters wove circles around the vast sheet the ones behind mimicking the one in front so they all swirled as one like schools of fish or

The families of debilitated former NFL players say the league is obstructing their access  an estimated 1 billion settlement over concussions  reflexively rejecting valid claims and bogging down the process with unreasonable demandsAfter a contentious fiveyear fight between the league and many former players who had accused the NFL of hiding the dangers of head trauma the two sides agreed in 2015  a settlement that covers nearly every former player for the next 65 yearsNow the families and their lawyers describe a succession of roadblocks as they try  claim payouts from as little as a few thousand dollars  potentially several million dollars  help thousands of retired players left mentally infirm in some cases severely from years of hits and tackles on the leagues fieldsOf 1400 claims filed so far 140 have been approved which legal experts say is startlingly low The remaining 90 percent of those claims are in the process of being evaluated or have been sent back  the players and their lawyers  amend before they can be approvedThe 140 approved claims are worth 195 million but the NFL has written checks for only 100 million The remainder is expected  be released after appeals are exhausted The league has appealed eight awards that the administrar granted and 12 players have appealed their awards calling them o low The administrar also randomly audits 10 percent of all claimsWhen the league agreed  the settlement several years ago retired players were ld that they could expect speedy payouts assuming the diagnoses for Alzheimers Parkinsons and other ailments covered in the settlement were in orderBut the NFL installed so many safeguards and trapdoors in the deal lawyers for the players said that in the eight months since the courtapproved administrar of the settlement began accepting claims many players have been forced  spend months scrounging for paperwork they did not think they had  keep finding new docrs  confirm established diagnoses and lodging timeconsuming appealsThe requests the league said are part of its efforts  deter potential fraud and do not represent footdragging or a lack of will  help the sick men But as a result the players now accuse the nations richest league with 14 billion in revenue of trying  wear them down so they accept smaller payouts or none at allPlayers will be shorted what they earned said Andrew Stewart a retired defensive lineman with Parkinsons disease who expected  receive nearly 3 million but after a series of delays and requests has been offered less than a third of that amount and is appealing This is not a settlement This is about paying sick men as little as possibleMr Stewart who was in the league from 1989  1993 and now lives in Canada received a Parkinsons diagnosis nearly a decade ago and has been receiving aid from two NFL benefit plans But  receive money from the settlement he was required  get a diagnosis from an American docrAlerted  some of the delays and accusations of unfairness leveled  lawyers for the players Anita B Brody the federal judge overseeing the case met with the NFL the plaintiffs chief lawyer and a courtappointed administrar on Monday in Philadelphia  look at ways handle claims more efficiently and more transparentlyOrran Brown the courtapproved administrar of the settlement said it was common for the parties  settlements  finetune their agreements  account for issues that arise He said that players were now for instance being asked  turn in the raw scores from their neurocognitive exams even though that was not explicit in the original agreementHe said the bulk of the claims that had been sent back  players were for missing paperwork But another group of claims has been reviewed because many players were receiving identical diagnoses from the same physician leading  questions of whether the players had been properly examinedMr Brown said he undersod that players and their lawyers might view these additional requirements with suspicion But he said they were part of an effort  prevent fraud not block real claimsIt does seem people feel they are being nickeled and dimed on paperwork Mr Brown said But theres nothing nefarious or conspirarial in this The goal is  make sure everyone gets paid for legitimate claimsThe former players who have filed claims are seeking up  5 million each  though most will probably receive far less  for severe neurological diseases tied  years of head hits on the field A tal of 20000 retired players registered so they could submit claims now or in the future from the settlement which offers onetime cash awards for those with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Parkinsons Alzheimers dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy a degenerative brain disease linked  repeated head hits that is diagnosed posthumouslyChris Seeger the lead lawyer for the plaintiffs said that the administration of such classaction settlements often had growing pains because of unanticipated problems In this case some former players have pushed the envelope he said  among other things obtaining diagnoses from psychologists not neurologists having docrs affirm diagnoses without examining patients or submitting claims without the necessary medical recordsBy bouncing claims back  players the administrar is trying  address some funny things that didnt look right and  ensure that when claims are finally evaluated they have a better chance of being approved Mr Seeger saidMr Seeger disputes claims  lawyers who accuse the NFL of footdragging and trying  reduce payments  playersIs this working perfectly No Mr Seeger said But if there arent sufficient records  support a diagnosis then we have a problem he said The procedures are laid out but there is early on typically confusion Some of it is legitimate stuff that is getting worked outMany lawyers for the players do not agree with that explanation The high number of claims that have been questioned they said is evidence that fraud prevention is being used as a way  keep down payoutsI worked at State Farm for 10 years so I understand all the tactics said Patrick Tighe a lawyer in Florida who represents 90 players There are all sorts of ways  slow down the claimsAll 35 claims Mr Tighe has filed have been audited or sent back because of deficiencies he said Jim Acho a lawyer in Michigan who represents former players including Gale Sayers said that just four of the nearly three dozen claims he had filed were approved and that two of those were auditedJason Luckasevic who represents dozens of former NFL players has filed more than 100 claims and more than 85 percent of them have been flagged for deficienciesThe settlement was sold  the NFL and Seeger as quick pay Mr Luckasevic said This was something everyone feared This is the NFL disability plan version 20The NFL which insisted on much of the fraud prevention language in the settlement denies that it has pushed the administrar  deliberately delay the payment of genuine claims and it said that stricter requirements were not added after the deal was made finalThere have been no changes in the terms of the settlement agreement or the criteria for claims approval since the settlement was finalized Brian McCarthy a spokesman for the NFL said in a statement adding that neither the league nor Mr Seeger had taken any steps  delay the payment of legitimate claimsYet many players are afraid  speak publicly about their cases because they fear the NFL will deny their claims or strip them of other benefitsMr Stewart one of the few who would talk said the league must be held accountable He was found  have Parkinsons disease in 2009 when he was 43Mr Stewart expected  receive a gross award of 28 million from the concussions settlement But after he filed a claim he was ld that another docr had  confirm his diagnosisThe new diagnosis though would have applied  his current age 51 which would have reduced his award  12 million because in the settlement older players are paid less than younger players on the presumption that their disease is related  age not footballAfter Mr Stewart submitted much additional paperwork the administrar recognized the earlier diagnosis But the award was reduced  750000 because the administrar calculated he had played only one season not fourIn the deal the more eligible seasons a player has the higher the exposure and the higher the award But the number of seasons is reduced if players spent time on the injured reserved list because they presumably were not exposed  head hits thenMr Stewart does not dispute being injured for parts of his career But in his day coaches forced him  keep practicing  often with the aid of painkillers  so he was exposed  head hits even if he did not play on game dayIn many ways the NFL case is different from many settlements experts said Most settlements describe the kinds of documents  support claims like a credit card number or a receipt In the NFL settlement many retirees are applying for benefits for dementia which can be complicated  diagnose because it is more subjective than say ALSBecause awards can reach millions of dollars the players lawyers  many of whom receive a percentage any settlement  have an incentive  make their clients look worse than they may be a reason for the NFL  be alert  fraud experts saidIndeed when the deal was first announced in 2013 the NFL agreed  pay 765 million But players feared the money would run out before every claim was filed so the league agreed  uncap payments In return for unlimited liability the NFL insisted on stronger rules  block fraudulent claimsBut the slow pace of approved claims has raised questions about whether those rules were meant  do more than fight fraudKenneth Feinberg who has administered large classaction settlements including those related  the BP oil spill and the attacks on Sept 11 2001 said that in the cases he had handled defendants had a right  try  prevent fraud But the delays that have come from questioning a large number of claims can erode trust in the settlementIts not just how many claims have been found eligible but how quickly the money goes out the door said Mr Feinberg who is not involved in the NFL case All the words in the world are no substitute for visible evidence of generosity and checks flowing  families in needCollapse,sports

On paper at least the Websters should receive nearly 3 million based on his age at the time of the diagnosis 50 and the number of years he played in the NFL 17 The criteria are an attempt  gauge how long players were exposed  head trauma and how directly that exposure could be linked  health problems Younger players are paid more on the presumption that football not old age caused their problemsTo the Websters dismay they found out after the settlement agreement was announced that Iron Mike as he was known in Pittsburgh was not aumatically part of it Thats because the deal excludes players who died before Jan 1 2006The NFL pushed for a cuff date  prevent a stream of families from filing claims for longdeceased fathers and husbands The plaintiffs lawyers ultimately agreed on 2006 which allowed more families  file claims but was far enough back that it excluded the families of players who died before then from bringing wrongfuldeath and other suits against the leagueThe Websters and other families in their position still have a glimmer of hope The federal judge in the case Anita B Brody left open a legal window for families of players who died before 2006 that their lawyers hope  utilize Jason Luckasevic the lawyer for the Websters needs  show that the family still has the right  file a legal case against the league under their states statute of limitationsChrispher Seeger a colead counsel for the retired players who sued the league declined  be interviewed on the phone In an email he explained that some players objected  the 2006 cuff date but without a settlement that at least captured players dating  2006 many more would face the same stringent limitations as the WebstersThe 2006 cuff date is the result of hardfought negotiations between the parties he wrote in court filings in 2015 Had the plaintiffs not secured this provision claimants on behalf of all deceased class members would have had  show that their claims were timelyThe exclusion applies  players who died from all diseases covered  the settlement including ALS and Parkinsons disease But it is a particularly crushing blow  the Websters and  the families of two other former Steelers Terry Long and Justin Strzelczyk who also died before 2006 and received the same posthumous diagnosis Mike Webster did They spent many years listening  league officials question any connection between playing football and a degenerative brain condition before 2016 when the NFL grudgingly acknowledged a link between football and the diseaseIf you asked the 20000 retirees who are part of the class they would say Mike Webster should be paid first Mr Luckasevic saidThe league and the administrar for the settlement say that despite early hiccups and the need  weed out fraudulent claims the process is operating as intended More than 150 million has been awarded and many hundreds of other claims are being evaluatedWe are pleased the concussion settlement is proceeding as the parties and the court intended Brian McCarthy an NFL spokesman saidJoAnn M Verrier who was appointed  the judge  help resolve complicated cases said there were about 40 claims filed  the families of players who died before 2006 that have the potential  set legal precedent That means she must make sure  create a process  evaluate them fairly Once that process is completed the other special master Wendell Pritchett will begin  rule on the claims which will be reviewed on a firstcomefirstserved basisWe want  create a process where we can decide on these issues once and for all Ms Verrier saidGarrett Webster though is losing his patienceIts insane that we havent been paid because every suit uses my dad in their case he said Mr Webster who wore a Steelers sweatshirt  a sandwich shop here on a recent afternoon sat near pictures of his father and other Steelers players on the walls If Mike Webster doesnt happen this case doesnt happen he addedSitting in a booth next  her son picking at a salad Pam Webster said she and her children were used  delays Starting in the late1990s Mike Webster and his lawyers spent years fighting for full disability benefits After he died a court finally ruled against the leagues disability board That provided a hollow vicry The Websters are also seeking a socalled Legacy Benefit payment that the NFL pays  families of deceased players That is not likely  amount  more than a few thousand dollars per monthAn award in the concussion settlement could provide the Websters with a financial shot in the arm when they really need it While Pam Webster travels from home  home Garrett Webster has remained in Pittsburgh where he lived with his father in his final yearsBoth Webster daughters Brooke 41 and Hillie 30 have been treated for substance abuse Pam Webster said those problems were a result of the stress of seeing their fathers life disintegrate after his NFL career Her other son Colin 38 was in the military He has kept football at arms length for years This isnt the way it was supposed  end Pam Webster saidAfter Mike Webster retired in 1990 he moved his family  Wisconsin where he and Pam grew up But after some poor financial decisions they lost their house Webster occasionally made money when his friend Sunny Jani found him gigs signing augraphsTo help pay the bills Pam Webster went  work at a restaurant then became a personal care assistant after she found out the family had lost their health insurance Mike Webster drifted through Pittsburgh Wisconsin and places in between Their marriage fell apartThe familys relationship with the Steelers is complicated At times the team helped its former player and his family At other times especially after his behavior became unpredictable the organization kept its distance In November the team invited Pam and Garrett Webster  a ceremony honoring team legends during a home game It was the first time she attended a game since 2002 when the Steelers honored her husband after his deathThey now proudly show off cellphone pictures of the steel football they received that day They are careful  say they do not resent the Steelers They want only what they believe the league owes them Through a spokesman the Steelers declined  comment on the settlement claimWe dont hate football we just are upset about Mike Pam Webster said But she added Every time we

At Georgia States nursing school the faculty used  believe that students who got a poor grade in Conceptual Foundations of Nursing probably wouldnt go on  graduation So they were surprised after an analysis of student records stretching back a decade  discover what really made a difference for nursing students their performance in introducry mathYou could get a C or an A in that first nursing class and still be successful said Timothy M Renick the vice provost But if you got a low grade in your math courses  the time you were in your junior and senior years you were doing very poorlyThe analysis showed that fewer than 10 percent of nursing students with a C in math graduated compared with about 80 percent of students with at least a B Algebra and statistics it seems were providing an essential foundation for later classes in biology microbiology physiology and pharmacologyGeorgia State is one of a growing number of colleges and universities using what is known as predictive analytics  spot students in danger of dropping out Crunching hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of student academic and personal records past and present they are coming up with courses that signal a need for interventionHealth care companies and sports teams have been working with predictive analytics for years But the approach is in its early stages on campuses A handful of companies have sprung up in the last few years working with perhaps 200 universities They identify trends in the data and create computer programs that monir student progress and alert advisers when students go off hisrically successful pathwaysDr Renick uses Amazon  suggest how predictive analytics work When Amazon looks at all your choices of books and makes predictions that youll like other books it doesnt need  know why youll like the third book he said Our big data doesnt need  know exactly why a student gets a bad grade It just happens thousands and thousands of times Were looking at a patternAt the University of Arizona a high grade in English comp proved  be crucial  graduation Only 41 percent of students who got a C in freshman writing ended up with a degree compared with 61 percent of the B students and 72 percent of A studentsWe always figured that if a student got a C she was fine said Melissa Vi a senior vice provost It turns out a C in a foundation course like freshman composition can be an indicar that the student is not going  succeed The university now knows it needs  throw more resources at writing specifically at those C studentsAt Middle Tennessee State University Hisry 2020 an American hisry course required for most students has been a powerful predicr The most consistent feature for those who did not graduate was that they received a D in it Hisry is a heavy reading course said Richard D Sluder vice provost for student success so it signifies a need for reading comprehensionBefore predictive analytics Dr Sluder said many of the Ds went unnoticed Thats because advisers were mainly moniring gradepoint averages not grades in specific courses You take a student whos getting As and Bs and you see a C in this one class he said and youd say He looks fine But really he was at riskSuch insight may revolutionize the way student advising worksAmong the hisric data that the education tech companies analyze are SAT and ACT scores personal and demographic information courses that students are taking and grades they are getting and behaviors like how frequently they are seeing advisers and turs and how actively they are engaging in the campus networks where professors post homework assignments lecture notes comments and gradesThe analytics programs know the paths that successful students have followed When a student veers off that path like getting a low grade in a predicr course or taking a course out of sequence advisers get an alert a signal  reach out  the student and offer suggestionsOne perennial problem is that students register for the wrong classes Students think theyre signing up for a particular lab for chem majors Dr Renick said but it turns out  be for nonmajors In the past we might not learn about that until the student was already in the class or even after he had finished the course Now were getting an alert and we get the student in the right class We had 2000 students like this last yearThe advisers are linked so that their notes and meetings with students are available for colleagues just as docrs in hospital systems share notes on patientsMost universities have not been using big data long enough  see improvement in four or sixyear graduation rates But some evidence indicates a positive impact The schools that have seen some success have combined analytics with significant investment in other initiatives Georgia State has more than doubled its advising staff  about 100 and now meets the national standard of one adviser for 300 students Its a heavy load Dr Renick said but in the past we had 750  one In 2016 Georgia States fouryear graduation rate rose 5 percentage points  27 percent and the sixyear rate rose 6 points  54 percentAll of this is important said Dr Sluder But the technology is crucial Take out all the technology and you just dont get that end result Freshman retention at Middle Tennessee has risen 5 percentage points  76 percent in just two yearsA few universities are developing their own programs In September students at Stanford began using a digital ol based on 15 years of data that helps them in the daunting task of choosing from among some 5000 undergraduate classesNo single adviser however wise and alert can possibly be aware of all the instructional opportunities said Mitchell L Stevens an associate professor of education who led in the development of the programFreshmen at the University of Michigan began using a ol in the fall that mixes their personal and academic data with data on how earlier students did advice from them and study guides from professors After students complete a survey about their expectations for success in a course the program digs in the data  see if those expectations are realistic When they sign on it takes them through questions and answers in what feels like a conversationHello Kate You ld us that the grade you want  receive is a B This is a good goal for you You should be more confident that you can achieve this What if you aim for an even higher gradeWe are measuring social interaction Dr Ram said How many people do they tend  hang out with for different activities and is their hanging out dropping off week  week or getting stronger A lot of theoretical work has been done on thisThe findings are put in algorithms  predict who is in danger of not making it  sophomore yearMost of the predictiveanalytics people are looking at grades Dr Ram said A lot of times its not the grades but whether they feel comfortable and socially integrated If they are not socially integrated they drop outDr Ram has tracked nearly 30000 students over the last three years Matching her findings against actual dropouts she said she has an accuracy rate of about 85 percent but her project is still in the testing phase She says identities are kept privateThere are risks Mr Kurzweil said But I think the people in predictive analytics are mostly white hats and theyre doing it because they really believe theyre helping studentsStill he described the field as a little like the Wild West Theyve pushed ahead quickly without setting up the kinds of standards and governance that will mitigate riskIn June Ithaka S  R and a team from Stanford brought gether 73 specialists from universities analytics companies foundations and the Department of Education for three days of discussion on developing standards and ethical guidelines for big data on college campuses They met at the Asilomar Conference Grounds on the Monterey Peninsula where 41 years earlier scientists started work on the first guidelines for genetic researchSome universities are staying on the sidelines The financial commitment  a halfmillion dollars or more over the course of a threeyear contract that includes data analysis software and training  is significant Some are simply uneasy about the concept Mr Kurzweil said or are not convinced predictive analytics really worksLaura Mercer chief of staff  the president of Sinclair College a twoyear school in Dayn Ohio tells a sry  counter that view At Sinclair a C in general psychology or in Foundations of Business was found  be a sign that students majoring in those subjects wont make it She decided  take a look at the records of a few students who had taken the psychology courseOne woman who was planning  major in psychology had taken it and three other courses as a freshman in the fall of 2014 She earned three As and a CIt was a pretty decent start Ms Mercer said But guess what The C was in Psych 1100 In the spring of 2015 the student signed up for five classes She withdrew from one The next semester she withdrew from three of her five classes This fall she ok four classes and withdrew from all of themIt was just what the analytics had predicted Ms Mercer said I tend  be a little skeptical It wasnt until I dove in the records and I saw Yes indeed this is a problem Joseph B Treaster a former Times reporter is now a professor in

Sports of The TimesSometime around the third inning Friday evening as we sat in our upperdeck aerie and watched the Yankees battle the Red Sox my son Nick and I gestured at the weirdly placid crowd and exchanged shrugs of confusionOnce upon a donnybrook  attend a Red Sox clash with the Yankees was like getting an engraved invitation  watch Visigoths trade ax blows with the legions of imperial RomeThis night we heard no frenzied screams or vulgar chants demanding that Red Sox players commit physically impossible acts It was as menacing as an accountants conventionWe rode the B subway line here as National League infiltrars hapless Mets fans in search of meaningful lateseason baseball We intended  root for the Red Sox operating on the ageold and mindless theory that the enemy of our enemy was our friend As we waded through the endless lines outside security at Yankee Stadium is Department of land Security cubed a maze of questionable barriers police officers in full body armor walked pastI gave Nick a knowing look This is why I left my fathers old Bosn Braves cap at home and why it was just as well that my son had not donned his Pedro Martinez jersey Red SoxYankees offers a demented landOr notFor years I regaled Nick and his brother Aidan with tales of the Red Sox and Yankees tribal wars which lasted from the 1970s  the early years of this century To get the flavor here is Alan Richman a Bosn Globe columnist writing of Yankee fans circa 1978Not since the Panzer Corps reunions were declared illegal have so many misanthropes malcontents and just plain miserable people gathered  have a good timeAnd here was the great New York columnist Larry Merchant on the mood at Yankee Stadium awaiting the arrival of those doughty Red Sox Bosnians for affectations known only  themselves adore words with Olde English roots The crowd at the Stadium he wrote was magnificently hostile a collision of separate needs and collective memoryThe Yankees owner then George Steinbrenner with his ersatz Vince Lombardi imitations made a delicious heavy Explaining why he might fire his manager Billy Martin for the sin of losing  the Red Sox Steinbrenner explained Hes not going  push me  the wall without getting thrown over itThis was a man I could root against joyfullyAs my Mets descended in a botmless chasm of losing in the 1970s and early 1980s my buddies Peter Kurz and Fred Cooper and I trooped up  Yankee Stadium like desert wayfarers in search of an oasis We rooted loudly for the Red Sox Carl Yastrzemski and Jim Rice and Rick Burleson and George Scott who was known as Boomer and was a big slugger and a balletic defender with the glove he called Black BeautyLife in the Yankee Stadium upper deck was bracingly Darwinian  flat beer loose joints and anything goes We survived with rigorous adherence  behavioral rites You befriended the natives wrapped your Yankee insults in a Bubble Wrap of smiles and never narrowed your eyes when the natives heaped insults on you If the Red Sox held the lead after five or six innings selfpreservation dictated shutting up and hunkering down By the eighth or ninth inning Yankee Stadium became an outtake from The Warriors  the Rogues against the RiffsPunches and beers flew One impossibly humid night I watched fans it would be redundant  call them drunks in the upper deck hurling beers down on the bleachers The bleacher inhabitants stripped  their waists picked up baseballs and hurled them back in futile loops at the upper deck I believe they were all Yankee fans It was like a 16thcentury religious war schismatics fighting over causes o obscure for an outsider  understandIn truth I sort of liked those old Yankees Ron Guidry and Chris Chambliss and Willie Randolph When I worked as a doorman on the East Side a tenant ld me that Reggie Jackson had parked his Mercedes on Second Avenue I ran down there  find Jackson the great egocentric slugger leaning against the hood and holding courtTruth compels me  acknowledge that the Yankees of day are not so easy  root againstAaron Judge going through a Titanic readjustment  the American League pitchers collective adjustment  him is a fine young slugger Luis Severino is a former whippet who appears  be on a path ward becoming a fine pitcher The general manager Brian Cashman has revamped this Yankee team with the dispatch of a good pit man at the Indianapolis 500Didi Gregorius is a sweet fielder and hitter with a great baseball nameCan I sp nowAny more Yankee compliments and I am going  break out in hives I hail from a National League family  my parents were Giants fans before that team departed for California They signed on with the Mets in 1962 and never let go My sons will be in a state of high agitation these next few nights as the Mets face off against the Yankees in a fourgame homeandhome series that begins on MondayThe cooling of the Red SoxYankees rivalry requires anthropological explorationSome years back the Yankees inexplicably re down their magnificent old stadium and put up a faceless corporate facsimile You enter through a dull concourse the prevailing aesthetic is Death Star I overstate The scoreboard Friday evening introduced a Yankee with an image of Darth Vader and the sound of heavy breathing Nosebleed tickets run close  100 with various inane fees taled upSo the hoi polloi of which I was a proud tribesman have trouble

throw a dart and any number of women can step up and make it through  a final or win one of these urnaments said Darren Cahill Haleps coach I think that creates a lot of interest in the womens game

grass and  Wimbledon where she won the girls title in 2014 But there are no guarantees that she will hit new heights in a hurrySudden fame can be a burden and her highrisk approach gives her for now

that the womens game needs genuine rivalries at the p There has been a dearth of them for far o long while the mens game has continued  thrive because of themFederer Nadal Andy Murray Novak Djokovic

they are still in the p five of the rankings Nadal is back up  No 2 his highest ranking since 2014 And the band looks set  get gether again at WimbledonFederer plans  play both Stuttgart and Halle before Wimbledon where he has won seven times but not since 2012 Nadal has won two titles at the All England Club and reached three other finals but he has won only five matches tal at Wimbledon since 2011 losing twice in the second round and once in the first roundHe missed the event last year because of a leftwrist injury but what worries him most at this stage is his kneesI played five finals at Wimbledon but since Ive had problems with my knees since 2012 playing on grass has been more complicated for me he said Playing on grass is very particular You need  get down very low You have less stability but I like playing on itA good omen The other two years he won the French Open without dropping a set 2008 and 2010 he won Wimbledon oOn grass anything can happen Nadal said I could win the first two matches and then the sry could change The first matches are always very dangerousA little danger would be refreshing after Roland Garros where Nadal was again in a class of his own He is a different player than he was in 2005 the year he won his first French Open He is more ruthlessly efficient favoring shorter rallies His service grip and service power have improved His twohanded backhand is a fuller more consistently penetrating stroke which means that he no longer needs or wants  run around it as often  rip his trademark forehands That leaves even less open space for his wouldbe rivals  attackLike Federer his careerlong rival Nadal has evolved  endure but not even Federer has won 10 titles at the same Grand Slam urnamentRafa is a normal person doing abnormal things said Guillermo Vilas the former French Open champion and parttime poet from ArgentinaNadals life has of course been anything but normal since he became a star in Spain  leading his country  the Davis Cup title in Seville in 2004  defeating Andy Roddick of the United States in the opening match at age 18He is treated like a celebrity in Spain and abroad and is certainly accusmed  his luxuries but his upbringing and connection  family and his home island of Majorca have  against the odds  kept him groundedFor sure I have doubts he said when asked about the threeyear gap between his last Grand Slam singles title in 2014 and the title he won Sunday During that three years I had doubts Right now Im going  have doubts even in a few days because in tennis every week is a new sry and thats part of the beautiful thing of our sport Life is not that clear So if you have no doubts probably its because you are o arrogant I dont consider myself arrogant at allIn Nadals mind humility has pushed him  keep pushing For that reason I am having the success that I had he saidIt is a fine theory Even if he has sometimes risked sounding falsely modest the principle of giving every opponent and every match their due has been a remarkably effective formulaIt has added up  10 French Open singles titles and in light of the formula and his own gifts an 11th is hardly out of the

The sales pitches were filled with urgency and emphasized familiarity Act now or risk missing out on millions of dollars Trust us because we are part of the NFL brotherhood You have nothing  lose a former NFL quarterback implored in one but money youre entitled  and that you earned the hard wayThe pleadings are aimed at former NFL players who stand  receive checks from the largest legal settlement in sports hisry a pool of money that may p 1 billion for retirees who sued the league for lying  them about the dangers of concussions as they got their heads pounded on the fieldSome players may get very little but others with severe neurological diseases may receive as much as 5 million Now lawyers lenders and wouldbe advisers are circling pitching their services and trying  get a cut of the moneyIt may be standard practice for big legal settlements but the fact that many players are cognitively impaired and may struggle  understand the terms of the services offered  them has raised alarm among player advocates legal ethicists and the lawyers for the players who sued the NFLIve been doing this litigation for a long time theres always been a certain amount of stuff going on but Ive never seen anything like this  a multiple said Chrispher Seeger a colead counsel for the players who has received dozens of complaints from players and others about companies pitching sometimes dubious services Theres a sex appeal  representing NFL players and they are so identifiable so these companies who are predary it is easy for them  be successful Most of these guys are broke

said Mr Willis who played for the Bengals the Oilers and the Broncos This is not going  sp me from helping my brothers and they know where I am coming fromThe judge Anita B Brody also approved a notice that warned players about companies that according  Mr Seeger offer  help players navigate what are falsely portrayed as complicated registration medical testing and claims proceduresMost of the claimservice providers require players  agree  share 15 percent or more of anything they receive in return for helping them with a process that the providers portray in stark terms as unduly complicated They also do not always tell players that they can call courtappointed experts  receive free advice on how  file a claim or that they can visit docrs who will provide a free neurological examSome lawyers have hosted dinners for former players at steakhouses  get them  sign up Others have promised  get players appointments with docrs who will write diagnoses that make their medical conditions look worse than they are according  players who have received pitches from some of the companiesSome lawyers have also hired former players  sign up their brethren yet do not always disclose that the explayers are being paid  recruit other retirees One firm hired Joe Pisarcik the former Giants quarterback who until recently ran the NFL Alumni Association as a pitchman Mr Pisarcik did not answer telephone messages left for himMr Seeger said a few hundred of the approximately 20000 players who are eligible appeared  have signed up for these services But some retirees have resisted the comeons Walter Carter who played defensive end for the Raiders and the Buccaneers as well as in the USFL has heard from at least a dozen companies pitching servicesBut Mr Carter 59 who runs a packaging company near Tampa Fla went on the website for the concussion settlement and realized he could file a claim on his own Although he was annoyed  the lawyers selling services he does not need Mr Carter is more offended  the retired players who are doing their bidding including Mr Pisarcik who pitched himI watch how these atrneys work and I think its a crime Mr Carter said But most of them penetrate the confidence of guys  working with other guys Its the ultimate betrayalEven players who may have taken fewer hits  the head than frontline players have been approached Michael Husted a kicker with four teams over nine NFL seasons said he had received emails and phone calls from at least half a dozen companies offering  help him file a claim Most of these companies made it clear they were less concerned about his health than about earning a commission he saidI was definitely surprised they were reaching out  a kicker but then I realized the more people they get the more money they might get Mr Husted saidHe said the process  register online for the settlement  a needed step before filing a claim  was straightforward and did not require a lawyerIf you can read you can fill it out he saidJudge Brody left open the possibility of canceling agreements between these companies and any players they had enlistedThe NFL declined  make an executive available  discuss the issueConcussion Case Management and Legacy Pro Sports which was started  a former player said any misleading information on their websites had been correctedThe companies say that they are advocates for players who have difficulty completing the needed paperwork and that they charge far less than law firmsThey want  tell you its simple and you dont need  work with a service company or a lawyer  but when you sit down with the player and tell him  go  this portal get an ID number if youre a retired player with impairment its not necessarily an easy process said Jerry Passaro the chief executive of Concussion Case Management which charges players 125 percent of any award from the settlementRetired players are also learning about provisions in the settlement that allow Medicare former spouses banks and other potential credirs  recoup money  placing a lien on a players award Medicare and Medicaid for instance can recover money they have spent treating a players medical condition something that could amount  hundreds of thousands of dollars for players with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Parkinsons disease two conditions covered under the settlementMr Seeger the plaintiffs lawyer said that claims specialists representing the players would negotiate discounts with Medicare and Medicaid He declined  say how large they would be but he said that after the government was repaid players would still have a large portion of their awardSome players though may still need  pay contingency fees  their lawyers or repay unpaid child support or a bank or other lender And of course players who hired a claims service company will have  hand over 10 percent or moreWith any middleman service there are those who are doing it for a fair price and then you have

baseball signed  Babe RuthOn April 23 1930 according  several newspaper accounts the ball and some other valuable items were enmbed in a cornersne there at the northeast corner of Lexingn Avenue and 59th Street marking the beginnings of an addition  the sreHundreds of shoppers halted at the scene The New York American reported the next day as the polished granite was lowered  rope while sre executives and city officials watched from a platform p hats in hand and bounnieres in the lapels of their suitsThe sne looked about the same last week its Erected 1930 engraving nearly as sharp as it was in pictures from 87 years ago A young man wearing a black leather jacket and chomping on gum leaned against the engraving and fiddled with his cellphoneIf there is a treasure there he and everyone else on the busy sidewalk that day will most likely never find outThe capsule believed  contain the Ruth baseball is supposed  stay closed until April 2130  200 years after the cornersnelaying ceremony according  news reports about the event And it is impossible  know whether the baseball has survived behind the facade  and if so whether it can last 113 more years There is even a chance that it was never sealed in the cornersne in the first placeAlthough several newspapers reported that a baseball signed  Ruth had been placed there executives connected  the sre day including a Bloomingdale descendant said they had never heard of itJohn Ernst 76 whose grandfather Samuel J Bloomingdale spoke at the ceremony in 1930 said that he did not remember hearing sries about the cornersne and that the family as far as he knew had no records of the eventThis goes back so far said Ernst a managing member of B Bros Realty which owns the sres building and the land beneath it it kind of got lostAnne Keating a Bloomingdales spokeswoman said some current company executives were aware of a time capsule but didnt know what was inside until this springLast summer Laurie Gwen Shapiro an author who was researching a book about Richard Byrds expedition  Antarctica from 1928  1930 came across a news clipping about the Bloomingdales ceremony as she pored over brittle scrapbooks in New York librariesNewspaper accounts about the ceremony described two boxes left in the cornersne one containing prosaic items like coins and newspapers another filled with what The Herald Tribune called an unusual miscellanyThat second box newspapers said was supposed  include the Ruth ball a golf ball signed  Bob Jones a horseshoe a radio set a wedding ring a cocktail shaker a piece of talking picture film and predictions of the future written  prominent Americans Among those invited  offer predictions The Herald Tribune said were President Calvin Coolidge who had left office the year before as well as Henry Ford Florenz Ziegfeld and RuthThat collection said Nick Yablon a cultural hisrian and professor at the University of Iowa was effectively a time capsule although the term was not formally used until 1938The tradition of placing objects in cornersnes dates  the Mesopotamians who tucked gems and messages  the future in building foundations according  Knute Berger a founder of the International Time Capsule SocietyBut never Berger said had he heard of a cornersne containing an artifact as Holy Grailish as a baseball augraphed  RuthIf the ball is there and well preserved it could be the most valuable singlesigned baseball ever  worth as much as 500000 at auction said Leila Dunbar an appraiser of sports memorabilia and Mike Heffner the president of Lelandscom a sports memorabilia auction houseBalls augraphed  Ruth are not especially rare In fact Dunbar said he ushered in the era of professional athlete signing But she said the Bloomingdales ball would gain value from perfect provenance  the remarkable back sry of its many years in hiding and the fact that it dates  1930 when Ruth was at the peak of his fameHe was probably the best known person in America Dunbar said probably even better than the presidentShe and Heffner both said that being sealed off from the world would improve the chances of a balls remaining in excellent condition One reason Heffner said is that it would not have been exposed  light which is harmful  signaturesOther items reportedly in the capsule could also be worth six figures A ball signed  Jones who won golfs Grand Slam in 1930 would be extremely rare and possibly worth up  100000 Dunbar said And Heffner said the predictions especially if they were handwritten and accurate could be almost pricelessBut time capsule experts say water could have seeped in the container causing damage There are plenty of examples of people digging up time capsules and everythings crumbled  dust Berger said Or he said valuable items could have been slen before the capsule was sealed in the cornersneKeating the Bloomingdales spokeswoman said in May that the cornersne had never been altered and that coming renovations would not affect it And now that the company has become aware of the reports from 1930 she said we have no plans  open the cornersne until it was planned  be openedTo investigate whether there is anything inside Jorge OteroPailos the direcr of hisric preservation at Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Architecture Planning and Preservation has suggested methods like groundpenetrating radar and thermal imagingNot surprisingly Keating said Bloomingdales would not allow such explorationSo the mystery remains probably unsolvable for generations OteroPailos can see something valuable in that o It skes the imagination he said  know that a ball augraphed  Ruth could be just beyond a piece of sne on a New York street cornerIt makes you look behind the surface of things he said To see the city with an inquiring eye and  say What could be thereCollapse,sports
For a simple assignment writing code that would allow one computer  visit web pages located on another two students in H E Dunsmores class at Purdue University turned in nearly 100 identical lines of code Was it a fluke Or had they cheatedAs he looked over their work Mr Dunsmore a veteran computer science professor saw what he called the smoking gunboolean done  truewhile done This is pretty strong evidence that one had copied the other Mr Dunsmore said They later both confessed  collusionCollege students have flooded in computer science courses across the country recognizing them as an entree  coveted jobs at companies like Facebook and ogle not  mention the big prize a startup worth millionsThe exploding interest in these courses though has coincided with an undesirable side effect a spate of hightech collegiate plagiarism Students have been caught borrowing computer code from their friends or cribbing it from the internetTheres a lot of discussion about it both inside a department as well as across the field said Randy H Katz a professor in the electrical engineering and computer science department at the University of California Berkeley who discovered in one year that about 100 of his roughly 700 students in one class had violated the course policy on collaborating or copying codeComputer science professors are now delivering stern warnings at the start of each course and like colleagues in other subjects deploy software  flag plagiarism They have unearthed numerous examples of suspected cheatingAt Brown University more than half the 49 allegations of academic code violations last year involved cheating in computer scienceAt Stanford the alma mater of the founders of ogle Snapchat and countless other internet wonders as many as 20 percent of the students in one 2015 computer science course were flagged for possible cheatingIn interviews professors and students said the causes were not hard  pin downYouve got kids who were struggling with spending a third of their time on their problem sets with the option  copy from the internet said Jackson Wagner who ok the Harvard course in 2015 and was not accused of copying Thats the reason why people cheatComplicating matters is the collaborative ethos among programmers which encourages codesharing in ways that might not be acceptable in a class Professors also frequently allow students  discuss problems among themselves but not  share actual code a policy that some students say creates confusion about what constitutes cheatingThe executive committee at Yale where five students were accused of copying code last fall though a couple had charges withdrawn acknowledged as muchIt is often such a complex task  read these guidelines wrote the committee chairman Paul North a professor of German that the code  be written seems simple in comparisonPenalties can be as small as a zero on an assignment which is what the Purdue students received they were also docked a letter in the courses final grade Dr Dunsmore credits awareness of such penalties with a reduction in cheating in his courses over the last decade More serious or repeated infractions can lead  failing the course or even suspensionIts mostly that a lot of computer science professors actually check said Alex Aiken who heads the computer science department at StanfordThough coding is a foreign language  most people the principles of plagiarism are the same as with papers written in EnglishSometimes it is acceptable for lines of code  be identical if the code is performing a routine task or one that cannot be done a different way But other times it is a red flagstruct visitlist nodenoderow  rownodecol  colnodenext  NULLSomeone copying the code he said might render it this waystruct roomsvisited roomroomr  rroomc  croomlink  0At Harvard David J Malan the CS50 professor introduced a regret clause letting students who cheat and admit it within 72 hours receive an unsatisfacry or failing grade on the assignment and avoid further discipline  unless they do it againProfessor Malan said one reason for the large number of cases was that instrucrs were scrutinizing students work more carefully than before He also said that since students could use the regret clause instrucrs felt more comfortable going  the honor council when students had passed up that chanceHe referred questions about the outcomes of the cheating complaints  a university spokeswoman who said she could not discuss the cases because of student privacyTwo Harvard students who said they were familiar with some of the violations and who wanted  be anonymous for fear of repercussions from the university described one of the more blatant examples A student submitted code using a computer language PHP that had been taught in a previous year but not last fallSome students suggested that in other cases there was a fine line between reasonable sharing and improper copying particularly because the professor encourages students  discuss problems with one anotherThere is a gray area as  how much help one can get said Javier CuanMartinez the president of the Harvard Computer Society who ok the course two years agoProfessor Malan in an email said the guidelines in the course syllabus were clear One rule says that when asking for help you may have your code viewed  others but you may not view theirs Whenever a line is actually crossed Professor Malan wrote its often that oneStephanie Saul contributed reportingCollapse,sports

On BaseballLAKE BUENA VISTA Fla  The Mets most important addition this offseason might be a 42yearold righthander with a 411 career record and a 627 earned run average He does have a 667 batting average but has no hits in this century and has not thrown a pitch in the majors since 2004The Yankees opened the winter meetings Monday  introducing Giancarlo Stann the reigning National League Most Valuable Player  whom they owe 265 million for the next 10 years after a trade with the Miami Marlins The Mets opened  expressing caution about the high price of middle relieversI would spend a little less time thinking about our payroll General Manager Sandy Alderson said on Tuesday Were trying  put the best team on the field we possibly canYet they are doing it with a payroll Alderson has said could be lower than last years openingday figure of roughly 155 million The Wilpons never operate like the Steinbrenners of course but the difference seems especially stark nowNot that it unsettles Callaway He spent the last five seasons as the pitching coach for the Cleveland Indians who have won big with modest payrollsI was involved in a smaller market Callaway said on Tuesday You dont have  spend money  win I think thats pretty evident nowadays Its not about paying 30 million for a slugger Its about doing everything you possibly can and using every resource you possibly can  make your group of players the best they can be And if you do that youre going  have the edge over the other team in my opinionNow its great  have unbelievable players that have great talent But you can outwork em and thats what were gonna try and doSo the traditional roles are back in place on the field and off Callaway has nothing  do with the Mets hisry he never even faced them in his fiveyear career with Tampa Bay Anaheim and Texas He brings something important  his new jobI think first and foremost maybe we can bring a clean slate  the Mets Callaway said We can sit everybody down and say Hey whatever happened in the past has happened One of the things Im most passionate about is leadership and creating a new culture of things and Im hoping that theres a cultural shift in everything we doCallaway quickly added that he was speaking about constant improvement not criticizing the culture he inherits But that culture has been marked lately  persistent confusion about injuries and a sense of entitlement around starters Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard By often using words like culture and accountability Callaway understands what must changeI remember I ld Carlos Carrasco when I first started working with him I dont care if you like me but youre going  pitch better and in the end youll respect me someday or love me Callaway said referring  a Cleveland starter who flourished under his guidanceAnd when I got this job he texted me and said You know what I love you And I think thats how you have  approach it I was as hard on him as anybody But were going  hold guys accountable for their routines  make sure theyre doing the things that are very important  keep them healthyWith the Indians Callaway worked with one of baseballs most progressive front offices He encouraged some pitchers  work with weightedball programs and ran a staff that threw  far the most curveballs last season  and allowed the fewest home runs He loathes the idea of playing catch just  get the arm looseWe put Motus sleeves on all the pitchers in Cleveland and monired the way they played catch Callaway said referring  a compression sleeve with a sensor that tracks biomechanical data If you pitch like you do off the slope  your catch partner every day even if its 40 feet away or longssing going through your mechanics and using your legs its less taxing on your elbow and your shoulder Therefore you can do it more and you can recover better Corey Kluber did it the best and hes thrown more innings than anyone I think in Major League Baseball in the last four yearsKluber was actually second just behind Washingns Max Scherzer but that list is notably barren of Mets Among the p 30 pitchers in innings compiled since 2014 just one pitched for the Mets in that time  Barlo Colon Only Jacob deGrom managed even 120 innings for the Mets last seasonCallaway hinted Tuesday that he might not use a dedicated closer  We have  make sure we get  a save situation and if we cant get there it doesnt do any good  have this guy be named the closer he said  and was vague about his rotation plans But Callaway and the new pitching coach Dave Eiland have ld Alderson they want  work with Harvey and Alderson seems inclined  let themTrading Harvey now after two seasons sabotaged  injuries makes little sense Why not see if Callaway and Eiland can fix him or at least find out what remainsWhen youre trying  help a pitcher its probably never productive  try and get back  a place Callaway said I think its Lets try  improve upon what happened here before Now you may eventually get back  that place Maybe you get better than you were  begin with I think its just trying  make sure youre not focused on going from A  Z You focus on going from A  B  C with little improvements that turn this calendar year in something very productiveIf last year was A and a championship is Z the Mets offseason is stuck around F They are bound  add some pieces here or there but still have made no moves  improve their pitching or a lineup that had four starters traded last summerOne of them right fielder Jay Bruce went  Callaways Indians and helped them reach 102 vicries Then they lost in the playoffs  the Yankees Callaway got a new job but remains in their shadowCollapse,sports

The New York Times had a spotty record of covering the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980s  and gay culture in general Times staffers reflect on the papers past and what we can learn from it dayLike most children of the 1980s I cant remember a time when I wasnt hearing about AIDS I was in my early teens during the height of the epidemic and it permeated almost everything in my young consciousness school culture sports and the evening news This was when the Indiana teenager Ryan White was dying basketball star Magic Johnson announced hed contracted HIV Tom Hanks won the Oscar for playing an infected gay man in 1993s Philadelphia and the disease became the leading cause of death among Americans aged 25  44 At school the AIDS lexicon was drilled in our heads We knew  then that you couldnt get it from a ilet seat or a kiss But we were constantly reminded how we could get it Unprotected sex and dirty needles would fill in the blanks on many a health class popquiz about risk behaviorsI recently talked  the reporter who wrote that article my colleague Lawrence K Altman a physician with training in epidemiology who ld me what a hindrance it was in those first years of AIDS that people struggled  find the right language This was true he said not just for the government officials and docrs talking about the disease on television and in print but also for the journalists who had  explain it In doing so they often employed the same euphemisms like bodily fluids  substitute for words like semen leaving the impression that saliva from a kiss might infect youAIDS has always been scary  me But this shed light on a different kind of fear that I hadnt quite contemplated the kind that gay men before me must have felt as they watched this plague kill their friends and were left wondering whether they would be next For my generation it was the known that was so terrifying We knew that if you somehow caught the disease it might be a death sentence But we also knew how you caught it and therefore how  avoid it The fear of the unknown it dawned on me would have been far worseThe flier sleek and disarming showed up one day on newsroom bulletin boards in the summer of 1992 It was an invitation in search of a guest listIt was the first time that gay people working at The New York Times had publicly advertised one of their pride parties which had been happening for six years The idea that a bunch of gay people from The Times would get gether and have a party was remarkable after so many years of hiding said Richard J Meislin a former reporter and edir who kept his sexuality secret until the 1980s when other queer people at the newspaper started  come outIt wasnt easy  be gay at The Times when Meislin started in 1975 as a copy boy Many employees felt that AM Abe Rosenthal the papers edir was homophobic And the publisher at the time Arthur Punch Sulzberger had his own blind spots according  his son Abe was part of the challenge It was one of the issues my father struggled with as well said Arthur Sulzberger Jr the publisher since 1992 who recently handed over the reins  his son AG The way gay people were being treated  being forced  be hidden was antithetical  the values of the company and the values of journalismMeislin for instance never had control of his own sry He was outed  AIDS even though he didnt have the disease After arriving in Mexico City as a correspondent in 1983 he got sick with a mysterious ailment that made his joints ache The paper sent an edir  check on him because some people thought hed contracted HIV He hadnt and though Meislin recovered within weeks word of his sexuality reportedly got  Rosenthals desk Two and a half years later Meislin was called back  New York City cutting short his prestigious stint abroad The perception in the newsroom was that I was brought back because I was gay he said And its one that I sharedCartwright who started at the Times in 1977 said that episode was one of many reasons she didnt come  terms with her gender identity sooner If you lived openly as a gay person you were sticking your neck outRosenthal who died in 2006 denied that Meislins move had anything  do with his sexuality in an interview with Michelangelo Signorile for The Advocate 26 years ago People who are used  being discriminated against will sometimes take certain acts as being discriminary when theyre not he ld the magazineNancy Lee who eventually became the papers picture edir didnt dare put a pho of her girlfriend at her desk when she arrived in 1980 That was  risk everything said Lee who is now the executive edir of The New York Times News Service  SyndicateTo me those sries are unavoidably personal I started at The Times as a clerk  a columnist in 2012 while I was figuring out that I was a lesbian I never came out  him because I wasnt sure I wanted him  know After I left and returned as a reporter three years later I put a pho of my girlfriend at the time next  my computerThe path  my comfort I now know was paved  people like Lee who decided  show up  New Yorks pride parade in the late 1980s with other closeted Times staffers We werent wearing any New York Times gear but we knew we were at risk she said People were phographing it You could end up on the news They had their first pride party in 1987 Sulzberger Jr then an edir had started meeting with his gay colleagues several years earlier He would take us  lunch and say I know youre gay and dont worry about it youre going  be fine Dunlap saidProgress happened quickly after the caucus revved up thanks partly  Sulzberger Jrs determination  get The Times out in front of the issue The company began offering spousal benefits  gay couples in 1994 And in 1998 Cartwright judged the newsroom ready  handle her own coming out typed and printed on yellow paper and tacked on more than a dozen bulletin boards throughout the building I have decided  resolve a longstanding conflict in my life  beginning  live full time as a woman the letter said Cartwright a former copy edir remembers hurrying back  her desk after posting the last copy and walking  the clump of people reading what shed written Someone looked at her and smiled She started showing up  work as Donna six weeks laterThe only part that was difficult was getting people  sp calling me he and him she said She ld someone in human resources who reminded staff of Cartwrights pronouns but it just kept happening One day she realized that she was just being o polite One time when someone referred  me as he I got visibly angry about it and that worked so I did it a couple of times She didnt have many problems after thatThe Times gave Cartwright a key  a bathroom on the 11th floor of the building After she had gender reassignment surgery she began  use the ladies roomWhen I ld her that The Times still doesnt have gender neutral bathrooms she caught her breath They may have decided that I was a unicorn she said She suggested quietly letting the papers leaders know that The Times is kind of behind the times on this If asking nicely doesnt work Cartwright said we could always get visibly angry It worked for herThe front page of The Times has long held a sacred place in the media Back then seven or eight sries filed from Washingn and around the world would set the days agenda For decades TV morningnews producers have used the front page as a guide  mapping out p sries And yet roughly 700 editions of the paper had come and gone before AIDS quickly turning in a fullfledged crisis had earned a spot on  One It was never lost on AIDS activists just how vital the paper was  and for how long it did not pay serious attention  the diseaseAre you kidding emailed Larry Kramer the activist and writer The front page of The New York Times is the most important real estate in the world for getting any issue out As The Times goes so will every other news outlet all over the globeSo why was The Times seemingly indifferent  the sry for so longThe papers Science desk which was responsible for reporting on outbreaks at the time was overtaxed in the early 1980s and it did not help that identifying the cause of AIDS was a slow burn Science news was running as fast and freely as Trump is day said Lawrence K Altman the Times reporter who wrote the rare cancer sry and still works at the paper He cited sries the desk covered about President Reagan and Pope John Paul II getting shot along with advances being made with the artificial heartIf the burden was then on other sections at the paper p edirs were less than enthusiastic about surfacing the sry There were strong messages that you got that were not written on any whiteboard said David W Dunlap a reporter in the Metro section at the time You knew  avoid it It was a selfreinforcing edict Dont write about queersAnd then there was Kramers perspective Every friend I had from those days is now dead because it was no secret that Abe Rosenthal hated homosexuals he said referring  the papers executive edir at the time This is the chief reason why I hate The New York TimesMax Frankel the former edirial page edir at the paper which operated separately from the newsroom said this was in keeping with the papers ethos at the time They were being squeamish for some reason Frankel said speaking of the newsroom Their squeamishness was actually damaging  the public understanding of what was going onFrankel who would take over the newsroom in 1986 as executive edir said the edirial department was quicker than the news columns  describe anal intercourse as a means of spreading the disease Whatever their rules were down there we said were going  do it our way he said That was the approachBy that point the death ll was fast approaching 600 peopleNewspapers can be funny places Writers know Take the premium placed on brevity concision and economy Saying more with less its called od advice Maddening rigorousness Depends on the day But sometimes it hits a snag In order  say SYTYCD for instance its probably helpful  use So You Think You Can Dance first The show needs a proper name before a concise one For three decades though newspapers  this newspaper  made an exception Theres nothing more concise than AIDS It names a larger disease acquired immune deficiency syndrome But really AIDS gets the job done Only it was an improper name And so it often went unused since it named an improprietyMedically its not really AIDS that kills you AIDS acts as a doorjamb for other diseases  traipse in and ravage a body But the average obituary noted what traipsed but omitted what made the traipsing possible AIDSrelated rarely appeared  nor did coverage of the deaths of black people and LatinosNewspapers can be funny places So can people The omission of AIDS wasnt necessarily an edirial judgment Its often up  the families and friends and physicians of the deceased  state how they died In a real power move the dying could name their cause of death To see Roy Cohn die in Angels in America is  know that Liver cancer was his preferred cause of death not the complications from AIDS that actually killed him That was for homosexuals a label he swore he was o good for AIDS killed people But it also threatened  kill pride Families friends and coworkers died of embarrassment No one wanted  go  an AIDS funeral Hence the euphemisms and the workarounds There was only so much they could cover up of course since lots of people went  o many AIDS funeralsIt was a world that thrived in the shadows of New York  late at night hidden on dark streets behind barelymarked doorways typically guarded  a man sitting on a sol under a light bulb What ok place inside ranged from questionable  outright illicit the fullservice bar that kept serving drinks after 4 am the open use of cocaine and marijuana and in many cases the anonymous and often marathon sexual encounters among gay men Sex clubs bathhouses back rooms movie theaters afterhours bars dance clubs  places like Alex in Wonderland and the Mine Shaft and the New St Marks Baths all part of New York in the 1970s and early 1980s This was a culture that was known  some of gay New York but arguably not most of it And it certainly was not known  most of straight New YorkThe AIDS epidemic changed all that Almost overnight as panic spread and vernor Mario M Cuomo issued regulations in late 1985  close down establishments where unsafe sexual activity ok place this underground world came crashing  the surface A battery of city inspecrs police officers and reporters went in undercover  see for themselves what was going on behind those doors  and shared their findings with the public The Case for Closing Bathhouses Night Visit  Post Reporter Reveals Shocking Evidence read a New York Post headline over a 1985 sry that described in considerable detail what the reporter saw and heard as he moved through the dark warren of a bathhouse It was part of stream of columns and edirials  not  mention grainy video from local news cameras that had been secreted in the clubs  that was turning up the pressure on public officialsIt was challenging for news organizations as well drawn  the sry for legitimate reasons a health crisis and perhaps less noble reasons sensationalism as they struggled with just how explicitly detailed the reports needed  be And no less discomfited were many in the citys gay and lesbian community concerned that raising the curtain on a world that most people did not know existed could threaten the gay rights movement after a decade of progress Some gay leaders decried the city crackdown as an assault on privacy Consensual sexual activity  adults out of public view should always be beyond the eye and the arm of government said Thomas B Sddard the executive direcr of the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund in 1988 Others considered it a legitimate response  a health emergency Is compulsive sexuality freedom Jim Fouratt one of the citys earliest gay activists said a few weeks before the city cracked down I would argue its not All we got was a lot more alienated sexually and a lot more diseaseCuomo whom I covered at the time as a Daily News reporter based in Albany would seem at times asnished  even ashenfaced  as he learned about this side of New York from inspecrs and aides struggling  advise the governor about which kind of sexual practices the state might regulate Down in the city Mayor Edward I Koch was already facing criticism that he was slow  act in combating the epidemic gay political leaders contended that it was because the mayor who never married and lived in Greenwich Village was gay At various points in his life Koch said he was not or would not answer the questionAs the mayor and governor were at odds about what  do sound familiar Cuomos health advisers after much debate recommended shutting down establishments that permitted unsafesex practices City Hall pushed back as many of Kochs aides argued that a crackdown would simply push this kind of behavior in darker corners making it harder  regulate Cuomo finally moved essentially ignoring the mayor as he issued state regulations that would close clubs that permitted these kinds of activities and leaving it  cities  enforce Koch resisted at first contending the order was poorly drafted and difficult  implement He was obviously aware of how many gay activists viewed this as a civil rights issue a setback at a time when gay rights seemed  be on the advanceBut that wasnt always the caseThe problem was there was no definitive evidence  support that claim only the opinions of public health officials who when asked were quick  poke holes in the sry They invoked the word speculation three times A hospital supervisor in Brooklyn was even quoted saying the opposite We are continuing  see tremendous amounts of sexual activity among adolescentsSo why was this piece published in the first place One could argue that The Times which proudly bills itself as a family newspaper is puritanical  a fault But it also has  do with simple arithmetic In 1983 there were few if any openly gay reporters on staff and hardly anyone  challenge stereotypes about gay people It would take until the next decade before the floodgates would open at The Times and openly gay men and women would assume positions of leadership in the newsroom But even that more than two decades later hasnt spped many gay people from debating what exactly Styles  and the rest of the Times  gets right about their livesRead moreNew York City 19811983 36 Months That Changed the

Steve Scheer is a basketball junkie He had often fantasized about eavesdropping on a coachs huddle during timeouts The short edited snippets on some telecasts were hardly enough  satisfy his appetite for accessUnlike most fans though Scheer was in a position  fulfill his wish As a senior coordinating producer for college basketball at Fox Sports and a 37year sports television veteran Scheers suggestion for an allaccess commercialfree live basketball telecast was able  become a realityOn Friday when St Johns played at Sen Hall in a Big East Conference womens basketball game both head coaches wore microphones throughout a commercialfree telecast on Fox Sports 2 Viewers were able  hear not only what was said inside the huddle but also the live interactions and directions from the sideline and the coaches talks inside the locker rooms at halftimeIt is believed  be the first time a network has provided this amount of unfiltered content in a live sports presentation The one concession was that the game was broadcast with a fivesecond delay  censor any colorful language though that did not turn out  be entirely effectiveIm as excited for this event as anything weve done this year John Entz the executive producer of Fox Sports said in a telephone interview before the gameEarly on the broadcast sounded muddled as the announcers Lisa Byingn and LaChina Robinson struggled  be heard over the screams of the coaches But they began  find a rhythm speaking while the chatter from the sidelines was quietestThat chatter  Chin Chin  Sen Hall Coach Tony Bozzella shouted out in a play call  his team  offered a fresh glimpse in the orchestrations of a college basketball game Coaches instructed players mumbled  assistants and fumed at the refereesEvery call is going against Sen Hall Bozzella seethed after a blocking call Every one This is ridiculous Ridiculous Im glad Im miked up because this stinksAt halftime viewers got a better sense of the styles of each team In the St Johns locker room players sat in a tight Uformation around Coach Joe Tartamella who spent his time in front of a whiteboard sketching out plays On the other side Bozzella remained outside his teams locker room for 10 minutes as he huddled with his coaching staff in the hallway With only a few minutes remaining he entered the room  clapping from his teamViewers were treated  a tight competitive game With a little over two minutes left and the game tied at 57 Bozzella made no effort  conceal what he wanted from his teamWere running Princen right now for Titi he ld his players in the huddle referring  guard LaTecia Smith Sen Hall eventually won 6459Tartamella was so emotional in the closing quarter that a couple of curse words slipped in the broadcast There were also some technical difficulties early on including noisy audio signals for several minutes and the game clocks disappearing for a bitHowever  the second half the production quality was cleaned up After the game Bozzella let the camera in the locker room ahead of him Youre going  like this he said The room exploded with cheering and chantingVal Ackerman the commissioner of the Big East Conference said she believed television sports had long been headed in this direction as fans clamor for more and more behindthescenes access At the same time womens basketball telecasts have become so stagnant that ESPN chose  broadcast some first and secondround NCAA urnament games remotely last seasonI and others in womens basketball have tried  figure out what we can do  keep this great sport vibrant said Ackerman who was the first president of the WNBA from 1996  2005 before taking over the Big East in 2013How it is expressed on TV is part of the sry she said This appeals  me because its a chance for womens basketball  take a leadership position in how the sport is being presented  fansAckerman said the league would assess whether  allow another broadcast like Fridays in the future But Entz said he did not consider it  be a stunt indicating that if all went smoothly Fox Sports would almost certainly want  try it againViewers and people at home are expecting more access Theyre expecting  get closer  the game he said They want things they arent used  seeingScheer said he had floated the idea  Big East coaches several years ago and had been encouraged  their responses Ackerman said she had needed  receive endorsements from Tartamella and Bozzella before approving the initiativeAfter practice on Wednesday Bozzella was adamant about the need for womens basketball  break through on television channels already oversaturated with college basketball He recalled the former Tennessee coach Pat Summitts willingness  try new things such as the first womens college game played outdoors against Arizona State in 2000Growing the game isnt just doing a survey or a kids day or a clinic for 30 people he said How are we going  go outside the box When faced with an opportunity like this why say noBozzella said he had no plans  change his coaching style for the cameras He said he had encouraged the players he was recruiting  watch the telecastThe game of basketball isnt just the play youre running Bozzella said Theres a lot of intensity emotion psychological play A kid misses three shots what is Coach B saying  the kidWhat might be of greater concern is the point at which the cameras become o invasive infringing on the privacy of coachplayer relationships and turning a oncesafe space  the locker room at halftime  in another fishbowlOur locker room is very energetic  say the least Sen Hall guard Kaity Healy said Were probably going  act the same because thats how we play our gameAckerman said before the game that she planned  attend but that she expected  spend most of the time inside the production truck watching it on televisionThis is a chance  show another side  what goes on during a game Ackerman said Its a step that mens basketball hasnt taken yet and our thought was Lets let womens basketball have a shotCollapse,sports

Jack Gerber of South Africa is the oldest man  start the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race On June 22 2013 he was 68 years and 110 days old racing for the AF Corse team When he came in third in his class he also became Le Manss oldest podium finisherGerber is an outlier of course few people that age achieve international racing success But drivers in endurance racing of which the Le Mans 24hour race is the crown jewel have far longer careers than in series like Formula OneEndurance racing is no less physically demanding than Formula One and drivers in both categories experience high Gforces while cornering because of the downforce generated  each type of car The flagship LMP1 category Le Mans Protype 1 sees cars reaching speeds over 220 miles an hour about 10 percent slower than a Formula One carWhere Formula One is a sprint event with about 20 twohour races per year the World Endurance Championship WEC is a series of marathons with a season of eight sixhour races and the 24 hour Le Mans showpieceBoth categories demand stamina aerobic fitness core strength and mental acuity but drivers traditionally retire in their mid30s from Formula One while the other series embraces age as fundamental  experienceAt Le Mans age and experience are key for cars and drivers and are used  help categorize man and machine While a Grand Prix will see similar cars built  the same formula of regulations and with comparable power and speeds endurance racing embraces a variety of classes of car with members of each category competing among themselves  races within the raceThe headline fight is in the LMP1 class a bigbudget battle of varying power philosophies and design between Toyota and Porsche while in LMP2 the mandated engine type reduces costs and opens the field  a range of entrants not affiliated with a manufacturer The GT or Grand Tourer categories are divided in pro and am classes and it is here that the likes of Ford Asn Martin and Ferrari enter their sports carsDrivers are similarly classified with professionals and amateurs sharing track time in the same car Endurance races typically see several drivers sharing driving duties each responsible for a stint or stints behind the wheel Amateur drivers often called gentlemen drivers will often finance smaller teams working alongside a professional racer and improving their skillsTo ensure that these gentlemen drivers were given seat time in the teams they funded rules were introduced limiting the number of professional drivers allowed in certain classes This has created an environment in which it is in the interests of teams  open up their cars  wealthy and passionate amateurs and has had the side effect of increasing the age range of Le Mans entrantsBut the career longevity of endurance racing which takes a longterm view of its drivers not found in Formula One is not restricted  the amateur racers Mark Webber had a long career driving for the Red Bull Racing grand prix team and then drove for Porsche in the WEC after his Formula One career was overFormula Ones a bit more cutthroat Webber said If youre twotenths off for a few years then its all over In sports cars you can drive for a lot longer Its more teamorientated Its less individual than Formula OneThe manufacturers believe that when you invest in someone in sports car racing that investment sometimes its a bit of a slow burn  get the investment back as an individual as a driver culturally how they settle in the team all of these things Its an investment you have  lay down There is no patience for that in F1 ZeroThat lack of patience has seen the WEC field find room for many former Formula One drivers those who have retired in their mid30s and those who lost their seatsOne driver who went the other way is Andr Lotterer a threetime Le Mans winner who briefly raced for the Caterham F1 team in 2014 12 years after an unsuccessful test with the Jaguar Formula One teamYou have  be a big team player put your ego on the side Lotterer said of the WEC In F1 its like war against everyone Here you have  be mates with your three drivers You dont have  try  beat them You work gether and develop the car You have  be a brand ambassador as well There are a lot of boxes  tick and I dont think you find them so easily It takes time  develop themI think its not easy for p manufacturers  find drivers that tick off all the boxes Endurance at the moment you have  do sprint with zero mistakes Le Mans is one race Its not like a Formula One championship where you have 20 racesAndreas Seidl team principal of the Porsche LMP1 team is aware that for some drivers the WEC is a Plan B when Formula One is out of reachIt depends on the options the drivers have Seidl said Formula One its the pinnacle for drivers no question But once  or depending on how  their careers go the business we are doing is obviously coming straight after F1 for these guys Its a very attractive championship very attractive cars highly complex cars a very competitive grid That makes it attractive for themJos Mara Lpez a former star of the World Touring Car Championship and a current Toyota LMP1 driver looked beyond the Formula One dreamI dont think its about having a longer career Lpez said Its just about knowing that there is life after Formula One Everything for a driver is Formula One and it was for me At one time it was an objective and a dream But he said he is sure he enjoys the WEC much more now than he probably would have enjoyed being in Formula OneThere is always an option he said Life is not finished when Formula One is finished There are still many series many very nice cars  driveGraeme Lowdon former sporting direcr of the Manor Racing Formula One team and now head of the CEFC Manor TRS Racing team in LMP2 says the two disciplines require different skillsInside the cockpit in endurance racing experience is really quite important he said It is such a challenge in particular the long endurance races  Le Mans for example  it really is something else It is the greatest challenge going for teams and drivers as a oneoff race Theres nothing else quite like itFrom a team point of view what we try and do is put gether a positive mix of experience and speed We have tried  do things a little bit differently and have brought a lot of exF1 drivers in the WEC in the last season and a halfWere used  dealing with those sort of drivers and were used  dealing with the strengths and the weaknesses Lowdon said Its so different from singleseaters and requires a different skill set algetherKarun Chandhok a former Formula One driver has some experience of endurance racing For him career longevity in sportscar racing is simple Its a numbers gameThe turnover rate in Formula One is so high and theres an excess of supply rather than demand Chandhok said Youve got so many drivers coming through from GP2 from GP3 and F3 There are only 20 seats There are less and less seats availableHe said there were more seats available in endurance racing so drivers are able  prolong their careersIn sports car racing theres a much bigger pool and opportunity and therefore you can prolong your career Chandhok said Its quite simple Theres just more availability of seatsThis year the youngest driver on the Le Mans grid will be 17yearold Phillip Hanson who will share driving duties with Chandhok and Nigel Moore for Tockwith Morsports Ligier JSP217 in the LMP2 classThe oldest driver this year is 65yearold Mark Patterson So even if he wins Gerbers records are safeCollapse,sports

The world has changed since the last time one of New Yorks legendary tabloids was controlled  the company that owns The Chicago TribuneExcept that journalism in 2017 is not what it was in 1991Back then there was The New York Post and the question of whether New York could still support two tabloids That question remains But in 1991 the online world had yet  upend the newspaper industryThe definition of success is radically different now said James Willse who was the edir of The News when the Tribune Company sold it in 1991 I guess the first question the new owner would have  address is how do you keep score Is it circulation Is it a webonly playTop executives of Tronc spent time on Tuesday in meetings with employees at The Daily Newss office in Lower Manhattan The edir in chief Arthur Browne said the Tronc officials  including the chairman Michael W Ferro Jr and Justin C Dearborn the chief executive  had expressed a desire for making a go of it on quality journalismMr Browne said that Tronc would make investments in technology starting with a new online publishing software or content management system Beyond that he said Its just o early  say where there might be investment where there might be changes where we could get a boost from the other parts of the Tronc empireTodd Maisel a Daily News phographer since 1999 left The Newss office on Tuesday in Lower Manhattan sounding upbeat about what he had heardThis is the best thing  happen  The Daily News in a long time he saidBut a veteran Daily News newsroom staff member who asked not  be named citing concerns about job security gave a more skeptical account of the staff meeting saying that the Tronc executives had brushed aside questions about possible layoffs and left the overall picture vagueThe staff member said the Tronc executives talked about the expanded national digital advertising platform that could be created  tying The Daily News  the companys other majormarket print and online holdingsWhen they were asked specifics about the future they said Were looking in that basically the staff member said The message was that they had no plan as of yet which we found hard  believe because how do you buy one of the largest newspapers in the nation and assume our enormous debts and not have a planNo cash is changing hands in the deal The real estate mogul Mortimer B Zuckerman paid 36 million for The Daily News in 1993 after the brief turbulent ownership of Robert Maxwell the 290pound British press baron who had bought the newspaper from the Tribune Company Mr Zuckerman said The Daily News remained profitable for many years after he bought itThe economics of the Tronc deal are fuzzyTronc in part is betting on the operational advantages With the purchase of The Daily News the company is trying  create a national advertising play which has been difficult without a hub in New York Tronc can cut costs at The Daily News potentially  creating a single sales staff and other moves And Tronc will also use The Newss printing plant in Jersey City for The Hartford Courant and The Morning Call of Allenwn PaBut the calculation also depends on some significant variablesThe deal includes a 499 percent stake of the Jersey City property It is unclear what the property is worth or whether Tronc will leverage the real estate  pay off The Newss pension liabilities The extent of those liabilities are unknownOf all the things Tronc couldve done Im scratching my head a bit at this one said Douglas M Arthur of Huber Research Partners He added The digital audience theyre gaining is big but how are they going  monetize it Im concerned that the upside from the digital potential is more than offset  increased exposure  a very troubled print paper as well as liabilities that while not huge arent going awayLance Vitanza an analyst at the financial research firm Cowen  said that The Daily News would fill what had been the obvious gap in Troncs footprint a presence in New York By taking over The Daily News Tronc  which also owns The Los Angeles Times  will control newspapers in the nations three largest citiesStill The Newss circulation is a fraction of what it once was  an average of 271163 copies a day in September 2016 down from 722583 copies a day in September 2002 according  the Alliance for Audited Stephen B Shepard the founding dean emeritus of the graduate school of journalism at City University of New York said that even with investment The Daily News is never going  get back  its former gloryIt can fill a niche for working class people and people who are interested in sports coverage he said Print advertising is going away and theyve got  get their digital game upNew York had more than 20 newspapers when The News made its debut 14 in Manhattan There were millions of readers  immigrants eager  learn English housewives hunting for sales job seekers theatergoers men in gray flannel suits commuting from the suburbs each morning Mara Bovsun wrote in Big Town Big Time A New York Epic 18981998 a compilation of articles from The NewsBut  the time Mr Willse arrived the paper was always sort of the rogue child of the Tribune Company he said adding The idea of the paper a rock em sock em noholdsbarred tabloid I think always seemed somewhat alien  the more staid ownership in ChicagoEven so for generations The News was perhaps the quintessential New York newspaper But it had its origins somewhere in France during World War I according  American Journalism a hisry of newspapers and newspapering  Frank Luther MottIt was there that two grandsons of Joseph Medill the founder of The Chicago Tribune encountered each other One of them Joseph Medill Patterson described a conversation with Lord Northcliffe the English press baron who said his Daily Mirror in London was selling a million copies a day and that the United States was ripe for a tabloid Then and there the two cousins agreed that as soon as the war was over they would start such a paper in New York Mott wroteThey called it The Illustrated Daily News published  a subsidiary of the Tribune Company The 150000 copies of The Newss first issue sold out The impressive numbers did not last and neither did the word Illustrated in the nameMr Browne the edir in chief said that no immediate changes in the newspapers staff were contemplated because of the deal He will serve as publisher as well as edir and plans  leave at the end of the year Mr Browne 67 started at The Daily News as a copy boy in 1973 and except for a couple of years at Bloomberg News has

MARBLEHEAD Mass  When Jos Luis Ugarte the oldest sailor  finish the Vende Globe yacht race finally arrived back on terra firma in 1993 he soberly pronounced the solo roundtheworld race an inhuman event that should be done no more than once in a lifetimeBut here is Rich Wilson back for more at age 66 and in position  break Ugartes age record  two years After placing ninth in his first Vende Globe in 2009 Wilson an asthmatic American educar from this yachting hub near Bosn will again set sail alone from France on Sunday Taking nearly three months  complete the Vende Globe remains a singular test of character that allows no sps or outside assistance and o few hours of sleep as the weeks and months pass  along with the swells and srmsThe last time I slept two times in that race for four hours straight and both were accidental Wilson said last week in a Skype interview from France They had a 120decibel alarm clock on the boat and I slept through that and that sort of defines the fatigueA chain saw  the way typically registers 110 decibels but there was more delight than dread in Wilsons voice last week as he prepared  depart with the 28 other competirs from the Atlantic port of Les Sables dOlonneThe Vende Globe Wilson declared is the greatest sailing race in the worldThere is certainly nothing nautical that rivals it in France where the Vende a quadrennial event that began in 1989 remains a major cultural happening one capable of inspiring Sunday sailors and lifelong landlubbers alike and of appealing  the adventurous and iconoclastic niches in the French psyche Despite a growing international contingent a Frenchman has won every edition of the raceThe start is one of the great spectacles in sports as each of the 60foot yachts is wed out  sea through a narrow channel lined with hundreds of thousands of spectars Then quite abruptly  after the cheers and the commotion  there is solitude or at least a modern approximation of it with all the satellite phones and other means of communication now at offshore sailors disposalThe first transAtlantic passage I did our communication was through ham radio Wilson said In that race he said communication with anyone involved muscling a simple antenna up the mast and hoping for the bestThe way it is now changes it certainly but I dont think its a bad thing Wilson said I think you get  maybe tell the sries a little bit more immediately  whomever it is you are going  tell them  And I think it allows other people  participate in your adventureThis year his website will be translated in English French and two forms of ChineseWith the partners we have we certainly have the potential  reach two or three million students he said up from about 250000 for the last race all of them in the United StatesWilson and Pettengill then trying  break the San FranciscoBosn record in the 60foot trimaran Great American capsized on Thanksgiving Day in a ferocious srm with sea heights of 65 feet and winds of 85 knots The crippled vessel was soon thrown upright its mast broken Wilson and Pettengill were rescued 17 hours later in the middle of the night jumping on a rope ladder lowered  the container ships crewQuite often those things end in tears afterward because you cant get them on board because the conditions are o ugh or they go in the water and you lose them Lister said in a telephone interview from Nelson New Zealand To have even found them in the daylight would have been quite a feat Finding them in the middle of the night was asundingTwentysix years later Wilson still gets emotional discussing the rescue which has led  a deep and enduring connection with Lister In 2010 Wilson flew  New Zealand  be a surprise guest at Listers retirement partyIt has not been lost on Lister that his saving Wilsons life has hardly kept Wilson from continuing  risk it at seaI must admit after he did the first Vende Globe I said Dont try it again  youre getting o old Lister said But his fitness level is still as good as it was thenWith improvements in technology and safety in recent years the Vende Globe has become as much a sports event as an adventure Franois Gabart a cerebral and telegenic Frenchman won the last race in a record 78 days 2 hours 16 minutes That was 31 days faster than the first winner Tiuan Lamazou in the 198990 raceNo sailor has died during the Vende since the Canadian Gerry Roufs was lost at sea in 1997 but it remains undeniably extremeYou make a misstep and the consequences can be dire Wilson said If something breaks the loads on the boats are immense and the systems are complex Theres just an awful lot that can go wrongWilson added The equipment might have gotten safer but the ocean hasnt You are still out there in King Neptunes domain and King Neptune is decidedly the one in chargeAfter his first Vende Wilson confessed that he seriously had no desire  go sailing again He spent time with his mother an intrepid soul in her own right who had lived in Alaska in the 1940s But after Wilson attended the start of the 201213 race he decided he would aim for 2016In 2015 he resumed his fitness work with Marti Shea an endurance athlete and leading cyclist based in Marblehead who also helped him prepare for his first Vende She has focused on leg strength and balance because roundtheworld sailors legs tend  atrophy during the long voyage She also has designed agility exercises for Wilson in which he must climb over and under threefoot hurdles  mimic the cramped conditions on board during the raceCompared  the normal person in the population hes really fit Shea said Compared  the other sailors he definitely cannot be as strong as the younger guys and he knows that But thats where his experience comes in play Last time he was not expected  come in ninth place He had an old boat But people kept dropping out equipment breaking and he kept making the right decisionsWilsons performance in his last race has clearly given his generation ideas Three other sailors over 60 are in this race Enda OCoineen 61 of Ireland the Vende veteran Nandor Fa 63 of Hungary and Pieter Heerema 65 of the NetherlandsWilson will be the oldest ever  start the race If he completes it he will surpass Ugarte who was 64 in 1993 as the oldest  finish But this Vende Globe also has the youngest competir in the events hisry the 23yearold Swiss sailor Alan Roura who has developed a bond with WilsonI ld him that Im three times as old as you are but we have the same dream Wilson said So weve gotten  be pretty good friends with that concept I dont think you can go off on the Vende Globe without knowing exactly why youre out there and having a really good reason  be out thereFor Wilson it is about testing his limits but above all about teaching while testing his limits In that sense with the website and lesson plans in place he is never sailing aloneI know when things get really bad particularly in the Southern Ocean that the kids help bring me home Wilson

The major league clubhouse is a sanctuary a players retreat from the gawking eyes of the thousands of fans in attendance and the millions more on social media who examine his every step dailyOver the last year though some players have become particularly careful even when they are in that 25man hideawayAnd yet the player may not have had  act that secretively Although similar laws against use of smokeless bacco now extend  12 major league stadiums outside New York there is no evidence that municipalities are trying  closely monir bacco use inside clubhouses or that they are attempting  fine players for violating any of the recent legislationHowever Major League Baseball which supports the bans is doing moniring of its own and said it has acted when it has perceived that a player has violated the local laws Firsttime violars receive a written warning along with a referral  the docr now being used as a consultant  help players  sp using smokeless bacco A second violation brings a fine consistent with those listed in the local ordinancesMajor League Baseball said fines had been issued but would not say how many The fines called for in the local ordinances  sometimes just in the hundreds of dollars  are small  baseball standardsStill baseball officials and the local authorities seem  be hoping that perhaps more than any fines the publicity generated  the new laws will paint a starker picture of smokeless bacco and serve as a stronger deterrent  its use  and not only among major leaguersThe bigger goal is about ending the influence on young people said Rick Coca a spokesman for Jos Huizar the Los Angeles city councilman who introduced the smokeless bacco legislation there And thats going  occur over time not overnight he addedA study released in 2014  the Professional Baseball Athletic Trainers Society estimated that as many as onethird of major league players used smokeless bacco long a staple of baseball culture These days observation of various clubhouses suggests that the figure might be a little high Before recent games at Citi Field and Yankee Stadium one team had at least four players with smokeless bacco containers in the clubhouse other teams had no visible usageNevertheless a number of players said they viewed the new laws as an invasion of personal rightsThere still isnt 100 percent clarity in terms of whos going  be enforcing it said Granderson who also sits on the board of the players union Is it the Citi Field law enforcement Is it going  be the police Is it going  be the New York State Police Is it going  be Major League Baseball If someone in the dugout  like we have security there for our protection  if they see a player thats using smokeless bacco are they going  slap them with a ticket at that timeOne player who uses smokeless bacco thought the law created an unnecessary burden for players who should be focused on baseball rather than the risk of becoming scofflawsI do definitely look around said the player who requested anonymity because he had played at Citi Field Like are there any cameras on meA spokeswoman for the New York mayor Bill de Blasio said city enforcement of the smokelessbacco ban was complaintbased anyone can file a complaint  calling 311 The law falls under the SmokeFree Air Act which also bans smoking and electronic cigarette use in bars restaurants workplaces and other locationsEnforcement has consistently focused on ownersoperars rather than smokers the spokeswoman wrote in an email We havent received any complaints or fined any playersIn New York Citi Field and Yankee Stadium are required  post signs informing patrons and players of the ban on smokeless bacco At Yankee Stadium smokeless bacco is prohibited throughout the ballpark At Citi Field there is a twist Smokeless bacco is allowed in three designated locations that are inside the ticket turnstiles but outside the stadium wallsEnforcement and penalties for the use of smokeless bacco vary  city In Bosn the city police handle citations and violations although Lt Detective Michael P McCarthy said that none had been issuedIn San Francisco the law is enforced  the police department and public health officials according  Jess Montejano a legislative aide for Mark Farrell the board supervisor who introduced that citys smokeless bacco legislation in 2015 Montejano said he believed that no player had been fined at ATT Park home of the San Francisco GiantsThe law is really supposed  act as a deterrent  chewing which it seems it has Montejano wrote in an emailSimilarly no fines have been handed out in Washingn where the local health department is responsible for enforcement or in Los Angeles where the police administer the law according  officials from both citiesWhen the first laws were enacted in recent years there was some belief that managers would be asked  warn players who continued  use smokeless baccoGet the big sports news highlights and analysis from Times journalists

Manager Joe Girardi was asked whether his players were abiding  the ban he said I dont sit around and check on them But theyre reminded just like with all the other rules that we haveUnder the sports collective bargaining agreement rookies called up  the major leagues this season are not allowed  use smokeless bacco in any ballpark regardless of whether there is a local ban And use of smokeless bacco in the minor leagues where few players are covered  the union has been banned since 1993Major League Baseball also offers cessation programs for players who want  sp using smokeless bacco Dr Michael B Steinberg direcr of Rutgers Universitys baccodependence program is a consultant and the docr  whom firsttime violars are referredAlternatives  the stimulant effect offered  smokeless bacco have emerged o  most prominently the coffeegrind pouches that are being marketed  playersOne theory perhaps an optimistic one is that once the current generation of players leaves the game baseball will move close  being baccofree because the new players filtering in will be under a tal ballpark banOne who thinks that will occur and fairly quickly is Matthew L Myers president of the Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids an advocacy group based in Washingn that has led the charge for instituting local bans The goal is culture change he said By 2019 at the latest it will be a very rare sight  see any

international business school in Lausanne Switzerland and an expert in companies with dual headquarters said the choice of a second headquarters sends an important symbolic messageAmazon has the opportunity  help build and shape a city and region he said Thats easier in a Detroit than a San Francisco Its much different than just tapping the talent thats already there Amazon will attract people and other companies that are inspired  thatNext on Amazons wish list are capital and operating costs and incentives which Amazon identifies as high priority considerations That is as it should be said Charles M Elson a professor and direcr of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate vernance at the University of Delaware Amazons first obligation is  its invesrs Professor Elson said which means finding the most costeffective city in which  locate a second headquarters one that will produce the most value for the companyMost contenders have been secretive about their bids but the incentives will probably be substantial v Chris Christie of New Jersey and state lawmakers for instance have offered a 7 billion package of tax breaks on behalf of Newark Any city that really wants Amazon will have  ante up and most will find the wherewithal  do soNew York City with a score of 1047 and San Francisco 1045 are two of the most expensive cities in the country making them long shots Seattle at 1008 is just above the baseline Bosn at 1012 would probably barely make the cut Washingns score is 994The lowestcost American cities are mostly in the Sunbelt Austins score is 962 But many older industrial cities also offer cost advantages Cincinnati 94 Baltimore 965 Pittsburgh 97 Chicago 983 and Philadelphia 998 are all below the baseline Thanks  the strong dollar which could change

there But other cities also fare well Washingn is No 4 Toron is No 6 Bosn is No 9 and Baltimore is No 11Conversely Cincinnati Cleveland Milwaukee and St Louis all rank so low it is hard  see them as viable contendersDetroit Philadelphia and Pittsburgh fall somewhere in the middle but could still be competitive Amazon appears less concerned with how many tech workers already live and work in an area than with its ability  attract the talent it wants Seattle was hardly a tech magnet before Amazon Microsoft and then a host of oncefledgling technology firms set up operations there Amazon expects its arrival in a new city  have a similar impactAmazon adds that a strong university system is requiredMany contending cities offer firstrate universities including highly ranked programs in technology Bosn is a standout with Harvard MIT Bosn College Bosn University but Baltimore offers Johns Hopkins University and Toron has the University of Toron and York UniversityAmazon cites logistics as critically important specifically the presence of an international airport that offers direct flights  Seattle Washingn New York and San Francisco These cities are likely  have a large Amazon presence no matter who wins the competition for the second headquartersIn addition  major airports Bosn Baltimore and Philadelphia are all on Amtraks northeast rail corridor with easy rail access  New York and WashingnCommunity cultural fit and community quality of life are last on Amazons list of preferences Along with the usual amenities Amazon specifically mentions a diverse population and again excellent institutions of higher education If weather and independent coffee roasters are important Austin would be a good fitMost major cities offer an array of cultural culinary recreational and sports attractions and any that they lack will most likely spring up if Amazon arrivesThat puts a premium on diversity and education facrs important in attracting a talented work force Given Amazons vocal support for diversity and inclusion it seems unlikely it would choose a city or state perceived as inlerant or that has moved  curb civil rights like North Carolinas widely publicized effort  curb gay and transgender rightsThere are obviously many variables still  be assessed but based on these criteria and the weight I expect Amazon  place on them here are my finalists

FLORENCE Italy  Every June Italys latest batch of aspiring coaches convenes on Coverciano a secluded wellheeled suburb of Florence  complete the final stage of their educationThere are normally a couple of dozen of them largely drawn from the ranks of recently retired players Over the course of the previous year they have spent two days a week studying ward the qualification that enables them  work at the very highest level of soccer in Europe It is officially called the UEFA Pro License At Coverciano they call it Il MasterThey are following in illustrious footsteps Annio Conte who can win the Premier League title on Friday did this course Many years ago so did Claudio Ranieri who won that title last year This year graduates of Coverciano will win the championships of Germany Russia and ItalyBut before these hopefuls can join their ranks they must spend a month sequestered here among the pale yellow walls terra cotta roofs and sculpted cypress trees of Casa Italia the headquarters of Italian soccers governing body It is not a bad place  spend time but for four days a week for four weeks they work and work hardThrough it all each student must remember Covercianos twin heresies the two phrases they are strictly prohibited from using The first is ai miei tempi in my day The second even more taboo is il mio calcio my soccerIf someone says that Ulivieri said they cannot passUlivieri  his own admission does not like rules During his own long coaching career he inculcated a sort of grassroots collectivist democracy among his players he was famous in Italy for placing a bust of Lenin on his desksOn this point though he is quite serious Either one of those two sentences brings an aumatic fail and for what he says is very good reason Those two phrases run against everything Ulivieri 76 and his colleagues teach at Coverciano everything they believe everything that has made this place for almost 60 years the most fertile most formidable proving ground for coaches in the worldOn Friday in West Bromwich England only nine months after he ok charge of Chelsea Conte is expected  become the seventh nonBritish manager  win the Premier League Of the previous six half  Carlo Ancelotti Rober Mancini and Ranieri  are ItalianIt is not just in England that Italians are thriving Massimiliano Allegri Contes successor at Juventus will secure yet another Serie A championship this weekend in Italy where only four of the 20 pdivision managers are imported Ancelotti now at Bayern Munich has added the German title  the English French and Italian crowns he has already gathered And Massimo Carrera once one of Contes assistants last month guided Spartak Moscow  its first Russian championship since 2001All of them are alumni of Coverciano just as the great names of Italian coaching  Arrigo Sacchi Marcello Lippi Giovanni Trapatni and the rest  were before them though there is no other common thread that bonds their teamsWhere the graduates of soccers other great coaching schools  those of Johan Cruyff and Marcelo Bielsa  all carry the telltale signs of their formative influences Coverciano leaves no such imprint To Ulivieri that is its calling card  the absence of a calling card  and a source of immense pride He is not seeking  create disciples but  forge individualsWe do not want  create identikit coaches he said There is no Italian style of coach I believe in this a lot This is not a facry There is no such thing as my football There is only the football that you can play with the 20 players you haveThere is a host of courses at Coverciano  programs designed for scouts video analysts technical direcrs and referees  but Il Master is its most prestigious qualification It is not taught though at least not in the traditional senseThere is a library where all the theses that past students have written are sred for reference but Ulivieri does not assign set texts Football moves o fast he said By the time a book on tactics is published it is already oldInstead he encourages his pupils  think In The Italian Job the memoir of the former Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli Lippi the coach who led Italy  the 2006 World Cup title remarked that Coverciano does not offer truths but possibilitiesThere are lectures on the finer points of tactics but they are hardly formal They can interrupt me whenever they like Ulivieri said The sessions he said are more like discussion groups The students have notebooks but they are encouraged at the end of each day  record their own observations the things they liked and did not like Ulivieri wants his students  learn from one another Lippi has said he considered that exchange of ideas the most important part of his time hereMuch of the teaching has a practical edge not just the days on the training field and the visits  elite clubs  this years group spent time at Juventus Inter Milan and Borussia Dortmund and also the near Serie B team Perugia  but in video sessionsWe watch a lot of games gether Ulivieri said I will tell one student he is in charge of the home team and another  manage the away team I will pause it after 15 minutes and ask what they should do They will say Were doing OK Ill leave it Then we watch another 15 minutes We pause it OK what do you do now And youThis is the message Ulivieri wants his students  comprehend Every game is dynamic fluid in a perpetual state of flux Things change and so must the coaches He likes  see managers who take the game in hand who adjust and alter and tweak as the situation demandsHe draws out his own notebook  illustrate the point If our opponents have two really good central defenders he said sketching out a formation and we have two good strikers then they can cancel us outHe flips  a new page But if our strikers drop here and here then they are playing two against zero and we cancel their strengthAnother page Or say we are losing and a team is pressing us we have two choices We can dig a tunnel  and I think that is hard  or we can go over them You have  become differentThis is why expressing loyalty  a single style is banned There is no perfect football Ulivieri said There is only the right football for the right moment It is one of the things he admires about Conte the way he has adapted his approach for his players and for his circumstancesYou cannot teach English players like you teach Italians he said They would look at you like you were crazyUlivieri does not except himself from that process He still coaches a girls team often trying out tactical schemes with them  see what his ideas on paper look like in practiceHe is currently experimenting with three forwards playing deep but very close within 20 meters of each other It is a slight amendment  Barcelonas approach one the current set of Coverciano students has been researching The early signs are good The movements are very beautiful he said There are a lot of solutionsIt is an approach he says that can be deployed for only a few minutes at a time though he wonders if it may become more common in years  comeWe do a lot of work on what the future of football will be he said And we are convinced it is tactical flexibility teams who can change system week  week and even in games who defend one way and attack in another The future is teams who can change clothesThis then is why students are forbidden  hark back  what they knew as players In one corner of Covercianos sprawling complex sits Italys national soccer museum full of memorabilia from the countrys four World Cup triumphs It is overseen  Fino Fini He has worked for the national federation  initially as a docr  since 1958This is a place conscious of hisry but not hidebound  it Its eyes are not on what worked before but on what will work next It has no use for nostalgia or for fundamentalism Like the sport it studies it is constantly evolving That is its calling card the mark it leaves on all those who pass through its doors Conte is the latest  prove its success He will not be the lastCollapse,sports

MARINE CORPS BASE QUANTICO Va  The United States Marine Corps is looking for a few more good womenAnd this time the campaign is a bit different Marine recruiters are turning  high school girls sports teams  find candidates who may be able  meet the corps rigorous physical standards including for the frontline combat jobs now open  womenThe Marine commandant Gen Robert B Neller says he wants  increase the number of women in the corps  1 in 10Ive ld them that 10 percent is where we want  go and theyre working on it General Neller said in an interview  recruit more women Find them Theyre out thereFor years only about 7 percent  8 percent of the corps which numbers 184200 has been women It is the smallest percentage of women among all the military services But after the Pentagons decision  allow women who qualify  serve in combat jobs thousands of new infantry armor and other frontline posts are now openGeneral Neller said he wants  see women in some of those posts That order now rests with Maj Gen Paul Kennedy the head of the Marine Corps recruiting commandGeneral Kennedy is aggressively recruiting women for the service He is sending targeted mailings changing advertising  better represent female Marines and traveling the country  meet with coaches and female athletes who may be wellsuited for the rigors of Marine serviceIn particular General Neller believes female wrestlers are good candidatesWe looked at that and said Wow thats kinda what were looking for he said Theyre disciplined theyre fit theyre focused on their missionAccording  General Kennedy the Marines for the first time are mailing recruitment literature  thousands of high school girls Updated advertising will show activeduty female Marines doing their jobs on the battlefieldThe biggest complaint that weve heard and were reacting  is that we were showing women in some of our material  whether its commercial or print or whatever  and they were always training General Kennedy said And that was a mistakeAlready he has gone  the Womens Basketball Coaches Association conference and has targeted wrestling and other sports gatherings this yearIn those sessions he said he is working  debunk misconceptions about women in the Marine Corps including worries about sexual harassment and sexual assault limits on career options lack of stability and difficulties with balancing family lifeWe got  talk  them got  show them there are plenty of female married officers and enlisted that its not a good ol boys club anymore when you talk about the career issues General Kennedy said in an interview in his office at Marine Corps Base Quantico VaThe other military services attract far more women and may be viewed as more receptive than the Marines whose slogan used  say it was looking for a few good men The current slogan is more inclusive The Few The Proud The MarinesThe Air Force has the highest percentage of women serving on active duty with more than 19 percent followed  the Navy at 186 percent the Army at 144 percent and the Marines at 79 percent according  Defense Department data from MayThe key General Kennedy said is  reach influencers  parents coaches  and  convince them that their daughters and athletes will be treated fairly And he said he allays fears that women would be forced in combat jobs they do not wantThe recruiters however know it will not be easy Data suggests they have  contact twice as many potential applicants  find a female candidate as they would  find a man So far very few are interested in the combat jobsIn a Chicago suburb Maj Shanelle A Porter the commanding officer of Recruiting Station Chicago said most women coming in the door just want  be Marines but so far two women have said they were looking for frontline rolesThe women she said want  be pioneersTheyre looking for that challenge Major Porter said Theyre trying  show we can do it oA Marine for 13 years Major Porter participated in college and professional sports  running the 400 meters  for seven years Her goal is  make sure that any female recruit she sends  training is readySome cannot do a pullup or hang from a bar for long enough And sometimes they need  become faster so they can finish the 15mile run in 135 minutesAll female recruits she said go on a highrisk action plan for at least five months that includes vitamin supplements weight management and an exercise regimen that includes weights crossfit training and a pullup programFor General Kennedy having a female Marine like Major Porter available  talk  female recruits and their families is helpful Women make up 165 of the corps 3565 recruiters and five of the 48 recruiting station commanders For now he says that is sufficientThey dont actually need a female recruiter General Kennedy said adding that the first person a potential recruit meets in a high school or a shopping mall does not have  be the same genderThere has  be a female in the process he said At some point youve got  have a woman that can answer the specific questions and maybe even answer the parents questionsAlready he is having some success and is on track  send enough women  boot camp this year  hit 87 percent of the annual recruits or about 3100 women The 10 percent goal would require him  bring in about 3400 women recruits a year he believes that is well within reachWere going  exceed the goal that was set for us I feel confident said General Kennedy I think we can blow through 10 percent like its an elevar spCollapse,sports

Terence Crawford will defend his world super lightweight title against Felix Diaz in the main event at Madison Square Garden on Saturday nightBut that might be the least daunting test Crawford faces in his immediate futureNext month the appeal of his misdemeanor convictions last September  for property damage and disorderly conduct after a dispute in an Omaha au body shop  comes before a judge and he could wind up in jailTwo months ago he reportedly pulled out a gun  break up a brawl between two female acquaintances prompting the Omaha police  detain him for questioning He was released the gun was returned and no criminal charges were filed after Crawford produced a concealedcarry permitBut both episodes are reminders that although boxing has taken Crawford around the world and given him a measure of wealth fame and perspective in some ways he has never left the gritty environment in which he grew upThe result is that Crawford four months from his 30th birthday is something of a contradiction He grew up angry his formative years filled with o many forays in gang life And based on those episodes in Omaha his homewn that anger still seems capable of getting him in troubleAnd yet he has grown o through two eyeopening trips  Rwanda with a menr who was once his fourthgrade teacher and through his decision  open a nonprofit boxing gym in the neighborhood where he grew upHes a person who people will love if hell only allow them  said Jamie Nollette the fourthgrade teacher who steered him ward Rwanda after reconnecting with him years laterTerences greatest strength is also his greatest weakness she added Terence is so strongwilled and when he feels betrayed its hard for him  get over that He feels like hes trying so hard  do the right things  be a good person but people only see a small picture of him and thats not who he really isAs a boxer of course Crawfords narrative is less complicated He is unbeaten in 30 fights with 21 knockouts and his name appears on just about every list of the p five poundforpound boxersIt would be a lasting affirmation for the path he chose as a wayward innercity kid  finding that boxing was something he was good at He won many amateur urnaments before earning Pan Am gold in 2007 turned pro a year later and then kept winning capped  his 2014 vicry over Scotlands Ricky Burns for the World Boxing Organization lightweight title in GlasgowAlong the way his career nearly derailed after a streetcorner dice game in Omaha in 2008 A bullet fired  a gang member smashed through the windshield of the car he was driving rattled around the interior and lodged itself in the back of his skull But Crawford was able  drive  the hospital and suffered no permanent damage other than the quartersized dent behind his right earIn a recent interview he recalled his first reaction  what had happened  I was furious I wasnt thinking about nothing but revenge I wanted  find the guy and kill him  and how gradually he was able  calm down and reason with himselfI realized that wasnt doing me any good he said That wasnt going  get me where I wanted  so I just started focusing on boxing and everything just changed for me dramatically I ok it as a wakeup call It was like d blessed me with a second chanceAs Crawford emerged as a boxer Nollette left the teaching profession moved from Omaha  Arizona and found her calling with a nonprofit organization that drills wells for drinking water in Africa Eventually a former colleague ld her that Terence Crawford the rambunctious 9yearold who always tried  get her attention was now a prominent boxerShe sent him a congratulary message through Facebook and was pleasantly surprised when she quickly received a responseI know its easy  say now but Terence was always my favorite she said He really just always would want  do something  make me proud and I could tell he needed that positive reinforcementCrawford said Whenever anyone asked me who my favorite teacher was I would always say Miss Nollette I just always felt she cared about meThe two met for lunch and Crawford asked if he could accompany her  Rwanda Six weeks later that is where they were learning about a method of reconciliation that seemed as foreign  him as the African foodThe concept was simple yet mindboggling and Crawford said he regarded the scene with disbeliefWhere I come from he ld his traveling companions that night at dinner we believe in an eye for an eye Thats what we do Thats just the way it isAnd yet Crawford admitted he could not help thinking about the programs message  that in effect anything is possibleThere was more some of it painful While in Rwanda Crawford Nollette and others on the trip attended a memorial  the genocide victimsTo actually see the little ba skulls thats cracked and broke from getting hit in the head with axes and stuff like that  its heartbreaking Crawford said I never knew things like that even happenedCrawford learned o about the joy Rwandans could find in the things that a child from north Omaha ok for grantedYou think we got it bad in Omaha or in any city in the United States and then you go  a different country and you see how bad they got it he said You give those people a balloon and theyll cherish it like you gave them a chunk of goldBack in Omaha Crawford began laying the groundwork for the BB Boxing Academy which requires its young members  bring their report cards  maintain their status and which offers turing and menring servicesBut he also ran in trouble The body shop incident occurred in April 2016 after a dispute with the owner whom Crawford believed had overcharged him for subpar work on his car Crawford lowered his car from a hydraulic lift and pushed it out of the shop which caused a reported 5000 worth of damage  the shops equipmentHe was convicted on two of three criminal counts  an assault charge was dropped  and was sentenced  90 days which was later reduced  53 He served only eight hours before he was released pending his appeal next monthThen came the incident in March I try  tell him he cant get involved in those things anymore Nollette said But believe me 10 years ago would have ended a lot differently Hes come a long wayCrawford acknowledges there is residual anger from his childhood As a kid my temper was on Cloud 10 he said Anything you say I would just jump on you you know But he also has the awareness that there is another wayHe has reconciled with his father whom he long resented for often being away in the Navy while he was growing up Both of Crawfords parents Terence Sr and Debra will be at Saturdays fightNollette a mother of three will instead be attending the high school graduation of her son Sam But her family will watch the fight on TVCrawford said he remembered how he used  feel because his parents were never at any of his boxing urnaments You look around and you see everybody elses parents cheering them on and it makes you feel bad These are the things you cant get backSo when his young son Terence III  one of five children he has with his longtime girlfriend Esha Person  competed in a wrestling urnament last month Crawford left his training camp in Colorado Springs  watch him compete in Reno NevHe was being a good father He is intent on being a role model He is also within reach of greater riches as a boxer And looming is that court case next month It is a complicated and ongoing sryCollapse,sports

CHICAGO  When the coach Angela Jackson phones a potential recruit the response is surprise Is there still a womens basketball team at Chicago State Is there still a Chicago StateThe first question is I thought yall were closed Jackson saidIt is a stinging query for this university a vital institution that is on the eve of its 150th birthday and that has served as a lifeline  lowincome mostly AfricanAmerican students on Chicagos far South SideJackson is highly regarded as a coach Her team went 2410 in 201011 Her players are resilient They play purposefully without bickering But they have not won in a year Perseverance alone has not halted Division Is longest losing streak  defeats in all 24 games this season and seven at the end of last season many on farflung budgetstraining road trips in the Western Athletic ConferenceA grim financial outlook at the university and the fear that Chicago State would shut down last fall scared off three recruits for this season Two other players did not return  the team Jackson said worried that their majors might not be availableThe starting center left school in early December depleting the Cougars of their leading scorer rebounder and shot blocker The point guard re a knee ligament At times Chicago State has taken the court with just six available players one above the minimum Jackson and her two assistants sometimes join practice so there will be enough bodies  complete drills or fill out a scrimmageAs the losses have mounted Chicago State has encountered an opponent that can be as difficult  overcome as defeat perceptionIs it really as bad as theyre making it sound members of the freshman forward Alexandria Cliffs family ask her No she said Not at allYet the questions persist as Chicago State seeks  recover reform and redefine itself athletically and academicallyYou could make Geno Auriemma the head coach and hes going  have the same problems without funding said Bob Hallberg a former mens basketball coach at Chicago State who is now the athletic direcr and womens coach at St Xavier University in ChicagoWhile Auriemma has won 11 NCAA womens titles at Connecticut Jackson 48 has withsod exasperating circumstances in the most recent of her 14 seasons at Chicago State Her dedication alone said Doug Bruno the longtime womens coach at DePaul University ought  qualify her for national coach of the year as crazy as that soundsTo not bail out  stay the course through difficult times is a testament  how good she is Bruno said She could easily get a sixfigure job as an assistant at a bigtime program and have a much better job I really admire what she does every single dayLike many public universities around the country Chicago State faces substantial cutbacks in its state financing A budget stalemate between the Republican governor Bruce Rauner and the Democraticled legislature has lasted more than a year and a halfThe standoff has left Chicago State with only emergency funding from the state which hisrically provides 30 percent of its budget 84 million for 201617Only 86 freshmen enrolled last fall amid the financial crisis dropping tal registration in a single year  3578 students from 4767 Then came the news that the sixyear graduation rate for the 2009 freshman class was 11 percentIn a recent edirial The Chicago Tribune said the school should explore a fullblown takeover  a stronger university perhaps the University of IllinoisChicago It cited Chicago States frequent turnover in leadership accusations of financial mismanagement whistleblower lawsuits and academic underperformanceThe persistent negative publicity has left Chicago State officials and students feeling isolated and guarded as if they needed  support one another because it was possible no one else wouldIn midJanuary though Chicago State received what it considered encouraging news The governor appointed four new members  the Board of Trustees and named an advisory group The stated intent was  keep the university open and independent of a mergerLast spring as 300 nonfaculty employees about a third of the work force were laid off Chicago State seemed  be asphyxiating Lucy said Thats a hell of a feeling he said Today Im not worried about oxygen at all Its plentifulStill in athletics as with academics the university is trying  catch its breath Chicago State represents an acute example of the difficulties facing NCAA schools on the margins of Division I as universities switch conferences in an unending often futile chase for dollars status and successWithout near rivals in the Western Athletic Conference or WAC Chicago State must take distant flights  Seattle Phoenix California New Mexico Utah and the Rio Grande Valley of Texas A number of the schools teams struggle  remain competitive And there is no team  support the schools athletic department on broad financial shouldersThe athletic budget for 13 varsity teams is 56 million officials said The Tribune reported that the working budget was cut  28 million in 201516 which the university disputes In either case Chicago States entire athletic funding is far short of say the 9 million in salary and bonus pay that Jim Harbaugh receives  coach football at the University of MichiganCurrently Chicago State has no fulltime athletic direcr and only one publicist for all of its teams Fliers posted around campus seek students interested in joining the golf and track teamsA wish list for sports facilities includes a new floor for the basketball practice gym which the university budget committee says needs  be replaced for safetySarah Amalou a guard from Denmark who returned home after the 201415 season when she was a redshirt freshman said that as budget troubles grew more severe players seemed  get less equipment and did not receive meal money over Christmas break forcing them  rely on what she called subpar food in the cafeteria Motivation seemed  lag she saidA lot of very competent people in the athletic department slowly quit their jobs she said This indicated something was very wrongChicago State is clearly not a fit for the athletic conference geographically or financially said B David Ridpath an associate professor of sports business at Ohio University and president of the Drake Group which urges reform in college athleticsRidpath urged the university  explore another Division I conference or consider downgrading athletics  Division II or III in which the teams could play opponents in and near Chicago cut costs and be competitive The dropping of sports entirely while honoring scholarships should also be up for discussion he saidIts a sad situation you feel for those kids Ridpath said But  jettisoning athletics he added you could certainly save a few million bucksThat could be maybe a step in the right direction for righting the ship there he continued but Im not o optimistic that the university as a whole is going  surviveJeff Hurd the WACs commissioner said in a statement that the conference was providing administrative guidance as Chicago State sought  remain a Division I school But he spped short of saying that the Cougars would remain in the leagueChicago State officials said they had no intention of dropping sports or leaving Division I Instead the university is exploring the idea of adding a nonscholarship football team along with a marching band and club sports in an attempt  attract more students from the Chicago public schools and enhance the universitys brandSports are going  play a central role in the revitalization of Chicago State University said the Rev Marshall E Hatch Sr the trustees chairmanTo drop sports would be a travesty denying opportunity for underserved students who might not have another chance  attend college said Jackson the coachA native of Detroit who played basketball at Old Dominion University she called Chicago State a diamond in the rough and said she had remained there through hard times because sometimes you find your purpose in lifeWe serve an AfricanAmerican community and I enjoy being the bridge from teenager  young adult Jackson said I think its important  those four  five years in those young ladies lives are importantTo coach at Chicago State requires a clear picture of what things are and are not within your control said Gloria Bradley a former assistant  Jackson who left in August  become the head womens basketball coach at Beloit College in WisconsinShes very honest and upfront with athletes and parents Bradley said about Jackson A level of trust is created when you keep them informedWith a limited budget a certain creativity is also required For nonconference play several socalled guarantee games are sought with payments of up  20000 for a willingness  travel  play a higherprofile teamThe nearest WAC rival MissouriKansas City is a 500mile drive so Chicago State must fly  all its conference games Airline tickets are bought far in advance One of Jacksons assistants negotiates hotel rates it doesnt hurt if the breakfast buffet is freeRecruits are sought within driving distance International players can be reached for the cost of a call on Skype Jacksons recruiting pitch is direct Were still here Were open were operating were looking  improve our basketball program We want  make sure we get  the p echelon of the WAC conference Come here and get a great education and graduate so when youre a huge success and a professional you can donate money backIf she is wearing a shirt with the Chicago State colors and logo Jackson said she completes her pitch  looking at her shirt and saying Its pretty difficult  close a whole universityCliff the freshman forward from Maniwoc Wis accepted Chicago States scholarship offer  play basketball and volleyball She said the financial crisis did not enter in her decisionThey ld me they had a good program that I would be able  get my education paid for so thats always a good thing she saidBut nothing about this season has been easy Before practice began last fall a dorm where a number of players lived had no hot water Residents had  shower in the gymThen in early December the teams best player a 6foot2 center named ShToya Sanders left schoolOn Nov 22 she scored 38 points grabbed 23 rebounds and blocked 5 shots in a defeat at Northern Illinois She was named the WAC player of the week Four games later she had returned home  Fort Wayne IndThe reasons were complicated Sanders said She could not decide if she was playing basketball for herself or her family She bumped heads a lot with Jackson The school was not the right fit for her A sense of futility accompanied the losingNo matter how hard you played you came out emptyhanded Sanders saidThe teams senior point guard Konner Harris re the anterior cruciate ligament in her knee Jackson said When Chicago State set out  face Grand Canyon University in Phoenix in late January its p scorer a swing player named Kaylee Allen was out with a concussion Only one substitute was availableNadia Miller a guard was hit in the eye with five minutes remaining She kept rubbing it with her jersey but remained in the game until the final

daughter both wearing school sweatshirts Given the universitys financial situation Moore said Im pleasantly surprised theyre still able  travelOn Feb 4 at home Chicago State faced New Mexico State the

Here are Miles 1 through 24 left mostly intact complete with dated references  the Nets new home theyve played at Barclays Center for over four years now and TV shows like Mad Men 30 Rock and ssip GirlWhen more than 50000 runners line up  start the New York City Marathon on Sunday the foot of the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge in Staten Island will be like a shaken soda bottleRunners in the green start will be on the lower level of the bridge and those in the blue and orange starts on the upper level Everyone will spend the first mile going uphill Not many runners are likely  feel the effects at least not yet There is o much exhilaration in the air and o many people around  run very fast anywayAs runners reach the end of their climb at the middle of the bridge and the Mile 1 marker they may feel on p of the world In actuality they will be at the highest elevation point of the race Only four boroughs and 25 miles  go Oh yes and those 385 yardsAfter a glorious run uphill in the opening mile of the New York City Marathon Mile 2 is a downhill joy ride from the crest of the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge in BrooklynA certain giddiness can take hold here The air of celebration and the steady decline give runners a natural boostJohn Honerkamp a running coach with New York Road Runners said it was easy  go o fast here and suggested not worrying about split times yetThe first two miles are a wash Honerkamp said Enjoy the view he advised and forget the GPS until Mile 3 If you hammer a downhill you can mess up your quads Err on going o slowThere is plenty  divert the paceobsessed There are more than 1700 portable bathrooms at Fort Wadsworth and a steady dose of them along the course beginning at Mile 3 But for some runners the staggered starts and long waits in corrals are o much The side of the bridge becomes a de fac urinal Race organizers for the record prohibit this But those of us who have run this race invariably recall itAs runners complete their descent they begin  diverge in their colorcoded routes spilling like rivulets in the streetsMy Times colleague Samantha Farlow said she was struck here  the first glimpse of spectars a small number of them high above on an overpass offering a warm welcome  Brooklyn The crowds will soon thicken and the volume rise but its all about small memories like this one isnt itIn 1970 127 distance runners paid a dollar each  run in the first New York City Marathon The course consisted of loops around the rolling hills of Central Park Fewer than half finishedThat first citywide race in 1976 had 2090 runners Adding tens of thousands of people  the field over the decades has turned race management in a science One of the most difficult tasks is keeping runners moving through the relatively narrow streets of the first few miles That is why the start is staggered in four waves on three colorcoded routes each with their own start village at Fort Wadsworth And it is why runners are further divided in crowdcontrol corrals at the startIt is here in Bay Ridge between Miles 2 and 3 where the three routes are most separate Athletes in the blue stream the elite men and women follow this route are the first  exit the highway off the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge on Dahlgren Place They hang a left at 92nd Street and a right on Fourth Avenue where they will settle in for the next five and a half milesThe orange stream exits at 92nd Street abruptly loops back ward the bridge and takes a right turn and then another right on Fourth Avenue merging with their blue brethrenAnd then there are the greenies who ran on the lower level of the bridge While the upperlevel blue and orange people quickly exit  streets the greenies stay on the wanus Expressway a bit longer in the southbound lanes which everyone hopes will be a little less congested than during rush hourThe greenies do not rejoin everyone else on Fourth Avenue until well after Mile 3 at Bay Ridge Parkway Now separated only  the median and with thickening crowds of supporters everyone is in this getherWith marathoners now settled on Fourth Avenue for a lengthy stretch many take sck of their pace grab their first cup of water or highfive a child for the first of oh a hundred timesPerhaps theyll wave back  coffee sippers at Mocha Mocha or hookah smokers at the Gulf Cafe Theyll marvel at how many houses of worship line Fourth AvenueAthletes will scan the sidewalks for family and friends whove taken the R train  Bay Ridge before they hop back on the subway in hopes of outpacing their loved one  another point on the course Spectars looking for a specific runner should be on the runners left for orange athletes and  the right for blue and greenA few decades ago Bay Ridge was known as home  generations of families with Italian Irish and Scandinavian roots Today Russians Asians and Arabs have arrived in large numbers There is still a Norwegian parade every May This is as much a cultural mix as any neighborhood along the wayode Bay RidgeHello Sunset ParkTheres St Michaels Moving right alongIn the sixth mile competirs will fly  at least half a dozen live bands and one spectacular cemeteryTheres a string of fastfood restaurants on this stretch but large quantities of everything can be had at Costco one avenue  the runners left at Third and 38thThis neighborhood is named after the cemetery Greenwood HeightsWith all the cheering and the music with runners dressed in tuxedos tutus and Superman outfits marathoners may be excused if they are not focusing on the American Revolution and the American pastimeThat Old Sne House built in 1699 and reconstructed in the 1930s was the site of important fighting in the Battle of Brooklyn on Aug 27 1776 The British Army was thumping George Washingns troops but an outmanned Maryland regiment fought off the British long enough for the rest of the American troops  escape and fight another dayThe Dodgers and their rooters would be famously colorful and boisterous in the decades  come but when the team advertised for ballplayers back in 1883 it seemed that management wanted a gentlemanly bunch according  Richard ldstein author of the 1991 book Superstars and Screwballs 100 Years of Brooklyn Baseball and a former edir at The TimesA runner in the vicinity of Washingn Park back then might have expected a sedate setting he said As a writer for the sports journal New York Clipper put it They want men of intelligence and not cornerlot ughs who may happen  possess some ability as players This stretch of Fourth between Miles 6 and 7 was once a bit dingy and off the commercial path but is now ripe for a diversionary game of Count the CondosThe subway station at Ninth Street is the best bet for spectars wanting  watch around here It has a crossover so you wont be stuck on one side you cant cross Fourth as the runners go  as you might at other near stations Also you could arrive on the R F or G train and then hop back on the G  head farther up the course  perhaps encounter those same tuxedos tutus and SupermenOnce athletes cross the Mile 7 mark theres less than a mile  go on Fourth Avenue before the complexion of the course changes dramaticallyAs the wer approaches details like the foursided clock below the dome come in sharper reliefThe numbered streets crossing Fourth Avenue which helped marathoners track their progress all the way from the 90s in Bay Ridge are gone Now its streets like Garfield Carroll and PresidentUnion Sackett Degraw and Douglass fly  Butler Baltic Warren St Marks Some cool bars line the left side here like Pacific Standard and 4th Avenue PubFlatbush Avenue runs the entire length of Brooklyn but marathoners will enjoy it for about 225 yards before hanging a sharp right on Lafayette AvenueNext its on  the ninth mile through some of New York Citys most vibrant neighborhoodsThis mile which crosses through the Fort Greene and Clinn Hill sections of Brooklyn is one  savor If Fourth Avenue was like a long overture  a classical symphony allowing marathoners  settle in and spread out then Lafayette Avenue is like a brisk jazz soloThe path is much thinner now on a oneway street adding a sense of intimacy and the illusion of moving fasterThe majestic Peter Jay Sharp Building of the Brooklyn Academy of Music soon appears on the right Across the street is Berlyn a visually tasty and thats all that matters right now GermanAustrian restaurantFuln Street cuts through diagonally creating a fork in the road and a space called Fowler Square which is more like a triangle It features a statue of a beloved Civil War general and an expanded pedestrian area Restaurants and bars like Smoke Joint Mullanes Bar and Grill and Franks Cocktail Bar line the angles of the intersectionThe race itself takes in only a brief slice of the neighborhood in the northwest corner After the Mile 9 marker at Classon Avenue the course runs a few hundred more yards on Lafayette Avenue before turning left on Bedford AvenueThis rest of the mile is a downhill lowkey breather with the Citigroup Centers unmistakable angled roof visible in the distance in Manhattan Its a good time  check pace breathe easy and  the extent that its possible during a 262mile run relaxRemember the roar of the crowd at the end of Fourth Avenue Those spectars on Lafayette who may have sweetly fibbed when they said you looked awesomeThe marathon Robbins writes runs counter  the Hasidic communitys strict interpretation of the commandment of tznuit modesty So when the runners reach this stretch they are met with silence interrupted only  the rustling of the fall leaves on the street or the muted sounds of small hands clapping The runners see stares  quizzical blank or bored  or they see people look away in modestyThe sight of thousands of runners in shorts or skintights traipsing through such a traditional neighborhood as men go about their regular Sunday business Sabbath was Saturday and women walk with their children and strollers is unforgettable and so tally BrooklynIt is also fleeting After crossing the aptly named Division Avenue Bedford slants  the right putting the ramp  the Williamsburg Bridge in view The look of the standers changesAt Broadway and a block  the right is the beautiful dome ap the original Williamsburgh Savings Bank building finished in 1875 Peter Luger Steakhouse is across the streetJust past the bridge on the right is a colorful mural outside the Williamsburg Music Center which showcases the local jazz scene The South Side is a longtime home  Puer Rican and Dominican residents but like so many neighborhoods around here it is gentrifying rapidlyRunners enter the park while still in Williamsburg enjoy a peaceful treelined stretch and exit in the home of Mile 13 GreenpointGreenpoint comes right after Williamsburg both on the marathon route and in the changes sweeping through the waterfront neighborhoods of BrooklynOn Manhattan Avenue though our running path for the 13th mile an oldneighborhood feel remains and an unconventional runner craving protein will find plenty of places  grab kielbasaAs marathoners emerge from the relaxing tree cover of McCarren Park they pass the Mile 12 marker and angle left on Manhattan Avenue where Bedford Avenue endsA block later the masses swing a sharp right on Greenpoint Avenue for perhaps a oneminute downhill glide and then a left on McGuinness BoulevardIt is a testament  the lure of this area that even on this stretch of McGuinness where loud trucks rumble past wheel alignment shops and electrical supply companies condos line the left side of the streetThe Pulaski Bridge is just ahead Is it halftime alreadyThe 131mile mark is a chance  assess the landscape and ask some questions Am I on pace Am I drinking enough Why am I doing thisAp the bridge marathoners will have their first sweeping views since the start of the race There is the Midwn Manhattan skyline  the left and signs everywhere else of the citys infrastructure and industrial past the trafficclogged Kosciuszko Bridge the lls  the QueensMidwn Tunnel and the Queens Citigroup Building the citys tallest outside ManhattanBut this is a

Italian said Ledden one of the Irish guys over a beer at Corner Bistro on Vernon Boulevard They intermarried Talk  another oldtimer around here and Im probably related  themThe Budweiser keeps the memory going he saidOnce gritty Long Island City now has more of a Greenwich Village feel complete with Greenwich Village restaurantsCorner Bistro a packed burgerandbeer joint on West Fourth Street

Left on 48th Avenue off the Pulaski Bridge Right on Vernon Boulevard past those restaurants Right on 44th Drive a quiet stretch Left on Crescent Street where we can see the back of the giant Silvercup sign This is the bakeryturnedstudio where TV shows like 30 Rock and ssip Girl are filmedThe taxing turns during miles past are catching up with us The incline on the VerrazanoNarrows Bridge was actually longer than this one but we barely noticed it back then The road up the Queensboro though seems endless Legs start aching Arms grow weary from pushing the wheelchairWe are on the lower level of the bridge and while the views of the East River Manhattan and Roosevelt Island below are nice there is a slight sensation of being in a darkened tunnel After miles of rousing spectar support there is nobody around now only the pitterpatter of our fellow marathoners footsteps It can get a little lonelyThen there is this daunting thought still more than 10 miles  goBut just as quickly as it formed the cloud begins  lift The climb up the bridge is complete and we are descending in Manhattan Theres a faint sound up ahead that is gradually getting louderOur legs start  recover a bit and that sound is now a rising roar Were gliding downhill now almost thereAnd then we reach the source of that sound swarms of wellwishers welcoming us  Manhattan as if we were a gold medal marathoner entering the Olympic StadiumWe suddenly find ourselves the ast of an Upper East Side parade Our spirits lift and our legs feel lighterF Scott Fitzgeralds passage from The Great Gats finally rings true The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time in its first wild promise of all the mystery and the beauty in the worldOnly 10 miles  go All is groovyThe New York City Marathon is steeped in the citys popular culture and no part of the course is more celebrated and packed with spectars than the Upper East SideAs they exit the Queensboro Bridge athletes swing a hairpin turn on 59th Street and in a wall of sound from the crowd They pass the restaurant Uncorked on the right Mile 16 is in our blood said the manager Paul Murdock whose patrons also have mimosas in their bloodMarathoners quickly hang a left on First Avenue where they settle in for a straightarrow 34mile joy rideThe residential wers here dwarf the churches and their chance  serve as beacons but a sharpeyed runner may catch some of the nice details etched in the entrance of the Church of St John Nepomucene at 66th StreetPolice barricades line this portion of the course because the rowdy crowds on both sides can run four  five people deep Brunchers with a view cheer from restaurants and support rains down from fire escapes and balconiesPlenty of runners are whooping it up o as the party atmosphere reaches a fever pitchFred Lebow would love itThe marathon parade continues up First Avenue as marathoners pass the Mile 17 marker around 77th StreetThere is a gentle uptick in elevation until 85th Street where a special vista is revealed a sea of human heads bouncing up and down straight ahead and as far as the eye can seeA runner can get lost in the hypnotic visual and perhaps take comfort in the knowledge that the heads rest ap other weary and aching bodies Its a collective pain And it is a relief  fleeting of course   see no inclines or turns in the viewable future just downhill and flat terrainA cookie maybe later on For now well have  settle for that gel station at Mile 18By the time the masses begin the 19th mile around East 97th Street elite runners will have been resting comfortably for some time beyond the finish perhaps enjoying lunch or a nice massageThere is a fair chance that during this fast flat portion of the course the winner is engaged in a brutal race strategy known as the surge As if 4minute50second miles were not fast enough over the entire race a man might throw in a sub430 around here in hopes of breaking up the pack or demoralizing an opponent who had thus far seemed in command Many fine high school athletes dream of running 430 for a single mile let alone ssing one in at Mile 19But that stuff happens in the morning Its the afternoon now and as runners enter East Harlem the corridor effect of residential wers lining First Avenue begins  dissipate There are more lowrise apartments and public housing complexes along with a sprinkling of snazzy condosBut wise is the spectar who watches from the other side of First Avenue on the runners left There up  117th you can grab some pizza from Patsys There aint nothin like that Frank Sinatra once said Patsys which opened in 1933 is a tasty reminder of the neighborhoods Italian pastAfter screaming kind words  the marathoners between bites cheerleaders can stroll over  Fifth Avenue  see them again after they return from the BronxThat double dose of support can lift the spirits of marathoners whose bodies are beginning  cry EnoughWe are here day  defend the honor of the Willis Avenue BridgeThis span which connects Manhattan  the Bronx about halfway between Miles 19 and 20 has something of a reputation among marathoners It is many memories recall a carpeted pathway in a brick wallSecond theres no law saying youre going  hit the wall Many marathoners who do long practice runs keep a measured pace in the early miles and take in some calories during the race experience no such thing at least at Mile 20 And many of those who do will come back  finish with gusGeoffrey Mutai the 2011 winner used the bridge as a springboard going on  scorch the final 10 kilometers and win in a courserecord time of 2 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds about 446 per mileMarathoners glide straight on the bridge at East 126th Street ending the First Avenue phase of the race To the left is a series of little bridges spanning the Harlem River including the Madison Avenue Bridge which carries marathoners back in Manhattan To the right is the Robert F Kennedy Bridge formerly the Triborough a threebridge complex that goes  Randalls Island and then either  the Bronx or QueensAnd straight ahead is the Bronx The first fiveborough race in 1976 barely uched a e in the Bronx which at the time was becoming a symbol of urban blightToday the Bronx portion is full of zigs and zags funky signs and heartfelt spectar supportThanks for the lift dear Willis Avenue BridgeLeft Right Leftrightleft AndaleftandarightProfessional runners and Bosn Marathon aspirants may not appreciate lots of turns but marathoners who had their fill of straightahead running on First Avenue may just love the Bronx Where else in the race do you run the corners around a Western Beef supermarketHere runners will encounter the perfect autumn atmosphere with changing trees music and supportive crowdsJust past the Greater Central Baptist Church on 132nd Street there is a new brunch spot called Shells Bistro which doubles as a real estate brokerage Here the food servers are also brokers said the owner Andrew Shell So patrons can order two eggs and two bedrooms while cheering on the runnersThe course swings around one of the best parks in Harlem Marcus Garvey Park a shady bit of nature with rocky outcroppings The race jogs around the park and back on Fifth Avenue for the continuing southward marchMuseum Mile awaitsAfter a little jog around the lovely Marcus Garvey Park the marathon route returns  Fifth AvenueNow its a straight shot down FifthAt 110th Street a roundabout called Duke Ellingn Circle serves as an introduction  Central Park Theres a statue of the jazz great Ellingn  the rightThe first site along Central Park is the Harlem Meer which dominates the vista  the right Water willow tree ducks geese Forget about the pain and check out the meerAnd theres the Mile 23 markBarely five kilometers  go For a welltrained marathoner a 5K is a nap in the park a speed workoutBut this is no ordinary 5K It is the final threeplus miles of the New York City Marathon and  now after 23 miles on the road muscles are screamingThe next mile is almost entirely uphill Its not a severe incline and it isnt something that would faze a fresh runner But this final stretch of Fifth Avenue and the rolling hills in Central Park offer an extra challenge on this memorable rideA couple of blocks later also on the right is Girls Gate one of the 20 named entrances  the park They were part of the original park plan but the names were not chiseled until the second half of the 1900s Did I mention that were going uphillOn the left side of Fifth the cultural hits keep coming The Jewish Museum is housed in the former Warburg Mansion at 92nd Street A block later is the CooperHewitt National Design Museum in Andrew Carnegies 64room mansionAt 90th Street with the familiar roundness of the Guggenheim Museum sticking out a couple of blocks ahead the race angles in Central ParkThe road curves  the right at the botm of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir and the back of the mammoth Metropolitan Museum of Art comes in view So does the Mile 24 markerTwo  go and then somePerhaps you have visited Central Park or maybe youre a New Yorker who runs there regularly Regardless the park feels different right now There is temporary lining on either side of the road creating a slight tunnel effect and the crowds and sounds and disorientation from having run so far can make familiar places seem foreignThe course turns right in Central Park and soon the Mile 26 marker will signal that there is just 385 yards  go Months of sacrifice come down  this Its a bit of an uphill now and the finish line finally comes in sight Just a little  more   go  and You did itCollapse,sports

SAN DIEGO  There is no Bryce Harper Mike Trout or Kris Bryant in the lineup The pitching staff does not include Clayn Kershaw or Madison Bumgarner  or even Noah Syndergaard who gave voice  why unlike in many other countries so many Americans are uninterested in playing in the World Baseball ClassicAint nobody make it  the Hall of Fame and win the World Series playing the WBC Syndergaard said on the eve of the urnamentSo it was fitting that when the United States needed a lift on Wednesday night it was offered  happyberepresenting Adam Jones who is the son and brother of military men and who grew up about eight miles east of Petco ParkAs Jones and then Hosmer raced around the bases they were greeted not only  firedup teammates but also  hearty chants of USA from a sparse but enthusiastic crowd of 16635The scene served as a reminder that while the boisterous Dominicans and Puer Ricans plucky Team Israel and some scintillating games have garnered much of the attention the Gutty Little Americans may yet have a voice in this urnament The United States has advanced as far as the semifinals only once in 2009 in three triesThe guys that are here we want  win third baseman Nolan Arenado said Thats why were hereIf the World Baseball Classic has become appointment viewing in some quarters of the baseball world interest in the United States has been tepid Members of the Spanishlanguage news media have far outnumbered their Englishlanguage counterparts here and Jones noted that when he went  lunch with his wife they overheard people wondering just what the urnament was all aboutIf youre not watching MLB Network you have no idea said Jones who lamented that o many people were preoccupied with their NCAA urnament brackets But you look around the Latin countries and they know exactly whats going on Their awareness is at an alltime high right now It seems like with the US and the American people its not as  I mean generally they think of spring training right now and not a massive urnament going onAmong the more aware was Zack Rexine who traveled from Baltimore for the urnament showing his colors  dressing as George Washingn and carrying an American flagI obviously have hope or I wouldnt be wearing this kitschy costume Rexine said But it is a little disappointing that the United States isnt more in it I wish I knew the answer why Theres nothing more boring than watching a spring training game when guys are just out there getting reps This means a lot moreThe bonds for many teams in this urnament run deep The Puer Ricans and Venezuelans say they are motivated  the strife in their countries Some major leaguers on the Netherlands team have known one another since their Little League days in Curaao The Dominicans are bound  their cultures love of the game and in their shared journey of making it off the islandMany of the ingredients for developing a clubhouse bonhomie on the fly are already in placeBut for the United States more work is involvedNo more than two players come from the same major league team and the 25 players on the roster on Wednesday came from 15 different statesIve been on six teams in the big leagues and I dont think theres a single guy Ive crossed paths with said Cleveland Indians reliever Andrew Miller forgetting for a moment that he teamed with Jones for half a season in Baltimore Certainly we dont have maybe the overlap of playing experiences that other teams do Id say were probably the team with the least amount of cohesiveness in a senseNevertheless Miller added there is a requisite amount of prideWe want  play better for the US we want  do better than maybe the US has done in this urnament in the past he said Theyve put a lot of great teams on the field but theres been three of them and we havent won any of them This is the American pastime and all that stuffThe United States had a formidable task on its hands on Wednesday The Venezuelan lineup was stacked with stars Jose Altuve Miguel Cabrera Rougned Odor Vicr Martinez and Carlos nzalez Felix Hernandez started on the moundThe United States countered with Drew Smyly who is Hernandezs new teammate in Seattle They shared a few words  as well as the No 34  while warming upThere was also remarkably little difference in their effectiveness Smyly struck out eight and also shattered three Venezuelan bats in four and twothirds innings He gave up only three hits two of them bunts But he left trailing  10 because he threw away a bunt  Robinson Chirinos who sent nzalez  third where he scored on a sacrifice fly  Ender Inciarte in the third inningIf the United States has a Blist starting staff there has been nothing second rate about its performance Chris Archer Marcus Stroman Danny Duffy and Smyly have not allowed an earned run in 17  innings allowing eight hits no walks and striking out 22Still there looked  be little promise on a night when Manager Jim Leyland rested Giancarlo Stann and Buster Posey and kept Daniel Murphy tethered  the benchVenezuelas Jose Castillo 21 a lefthander who has not pitched above Class A struck out Christian Yelich and Arenado  end the sixth with two runners on Then Odor hit a solo homer off David Robertson in the seventh  give Venezuela a 20 leadBut Odors second error of the game helped the United States get a run back in the seventh when Hosmer scored on Jonathan Lucroys sacrifice fly setting up Jones and Hosmer with opportunities  be heroesIn the coming days there will be other turns available o The vicry put the Americans just where they were four years ago when they won their opening game of the second round but then lost  the Dominican Republic and Puer Rico and were eliminatedThey will play Puer Rico on Friday night and the Dominicans on Saturday night when the Americans may not have audacious bat flips dyed hair or golden plantains but theyll have an opportunity  make people pay attention just the sameCollapse,sports

PHILADELPHIA  When T J McConnell a reserve guard for the Philadelphia 76ers was married last summer his brother and best friend surprised him at the end of the reception The funky beat of a familiar song filled the room as the dance floor flooded with friends and familyMcConnell knew the lyrics  heartHere they come PhiladelphiaOn the run stand up and cheerNo 1 PhiladelphiaHere they come team of the yearEveryone went nuts McConnell saidThe song was Here Come the Sixers a discoflavored anthem from 1975 that has become the soundtrack for the NBAs most precocious team The 76ers are so young they might as well take a school bus  their games But they commemorate their vicries  dancing  a song that practically struts down the street in bellbotms while shaking a tambourineIts very strange said Terry Rocap 70 a musician who performed on the original recording But its a good tune People seem  like itThe 76ers under the direction of Scott ONeil their chief executive have been dipping in the franchises past even as the team reinvents itself Chris Heck their president for business operations cited the teams new slate of uniforms which quilt gether several eras Theres Phila lettering from 1960 stars from the 1970s and a collar taken from the jerseys worn  the 76ers during the 198283 season when they last won an NBA championshipWhen Scott came in about five years ago we got gether and said We need  start bringing back what was great about the Sixers Heck said Because the heritage is amazingThat heritage also includes Here Come the Sixers which ONeil hoped  incorporate in recent seasons as a regular part of the gamenight experience But Heck said the rest of the staff voted  reserve it for home wins which meant that nobody got  hear it much at all The Sixers were 1072 just two seasons agoBut successstarved fans of the team are optimistic The 76ers employ several young players who are actually decent at basketball And despite some recent growing pains they should contend this season for their first playoff berth since 2012 Vicries are hardearned though and Here Come the Sixers is still something of a rare treatScotts always like I want  hear it more Heck said And were like We love it o But we have  stay disciplinedThe song urges fans  clap your hands and smp your feet in support of the team of the year which is of course the 76ers For the musicians behind the song its renaissance has been a pleasant surpriseWe figured the song would just be a fleeting moment of glory said Randy Childress 68 who played bass guitar on the song But now its going  be on my epitaphAt the time of the songs creation Childress was doing odd jobs for the 76ers while he finished his degree at Temple He recalled that he once earned 500 for dressing up as a turkey at a game before Thanksgiving A pair of female ushers clad in pilgrim costumes led him aroundI did all sorts of stupid stuff he saidAs for the team itself the 76ers were on the rise after years of yawninducing mediocrity But Pat Williams then the general manager undersod the 76ers needed  add some pep  the gameday experience if they were  draw larger crowds  the Spectrum the teams arena at the timeWe were trying  create the kind of atmosphere where it was a fun place  come he said in a telephone interviewSo when Williams learned that Childress was in a rock band he had an idea Perhaps the 76ers needed their own theme songArmed with a new assignment Childress invited Rocap and a third bandmate named Joe Sherwood  his small apartment where he had a fourtrack machine They hammered out a demo the original beat set  the steady dribble of a basketballBoink boink boink boink Childress saidOne morning after watching Sesame Street with his 7yearold daughter Rocap arrived with lyricsOne two threefourfive SixersTen nine eight 76ersAnd were going Oh thats great Childress said So thats where the initial burst came from and then we built the whole song around itThe band known as Fresh Aire wrote the song in E major a key at the p of the vocal range for most male tenors By pushing that range Sherwood said the song created energy And in hopes of protecting its shelf life over the years the band kept the lyrics free of references  specific players on the team  even the illustrious Julius ErvingOn the track the band harmonizes  an accompaniment that includes guitars piano bass and drums Sherwoods brother Richard gave the song some soul  jamming out on a Hohner Clavinet a keyboard instrument at the height of cool in the 1970s thanks  Stevie WonderMy brother added a little riff said Joe Sherwood 70 who began singing Here they come Deedley deedley deeeeeWilliams the Sixers general manager appreciated how the song turned out  it was exactly what he wanted he said  but the team kept its rollout subtleIt really wasnt a big deal Sherwood said There wasnt any big hoopla or major announcement They just started playing itWorld B Free 64 a former guard who now works as an ambassador for the team was a firstyear player when the song made its debut Before home games the songs first few beats would reach the players as they ok the floor It became an even bigger deal once Erving known as Dr J joined the team the next seasonWed be coming out of the tunnel and the crowd would be getting juiced up Free said And then Doc would come out there with that big ol Afro and start throwing it down BoomFor better or for worse the song has stuck with Free through the decadesI hear it in my sleep he saidIn the wake of Here Come the Sixers other teams reached out  the band  write their theme songs including one for the NHLs Washingn Capitals called Clap for the Caps But none of them had much staying power And when Williams left the 76ers organization in 1986 the song more or less left with himBut it had a good run Williams saidChildress Rocap and Sherwood meanwhile spent several years uring and playing at clubs Sherwood eventually started a recruiting business Rocap became a professional window washer Childress who had studied architecture began designing exhibits for trade shows and museumsThe Sixers theme song was largely forgotten until the early 2000s when it was resuscitated  Angelo Cataldi a longtime host for Sports Radio 94WIP in PhiladelphiaWe were really excited about the team and we needed a song Cataldi said So we did some research and we found out there was really only one and it was this 70s disco thing and it was dated and absurd But thats kind of our showCataldi now regrets the part he played in keeping Here Come the Sixers alive  its not his favorite song he said  but many others seem  have a more favorable opinionLast season Joel Embiid the teams effervescent center celebrated a win against the Knicks  dancing  the song with several cheerleaders Some of his teammates are similarly enchanted  itI actually play it all the time said McConnell the 76ers guard My friends will be like Let me hear the song And Ill put it onWhen Williams now senior vice president for the Orlando Magic delivered the keynote address at a prayer breakfast in Ocber he was surprised  the entertainment a rendition of Here Come the Sixers performed

WASHINGTON  President Trump began his first Thanksgiving vacation in office with an earlymorning Twitter rage in which he again vented about some of his favorite targets sports figures he thinks have defied himTogether the posts were a reprise of Mr Trumps personal attacks against sports figures  many of them AfricanAmerican  for what he judges  be poor behavior on their part and a failure  demonstrate enough deference  othersWhite House officials deny that the president is focused on race when he comments about sports and athletes But  hisrians and black activists the tweets are clear evidence of an attempt  the president  send a message of solidarity  many supportersPresident Trump appears  have a peculiar overfascination with AfricanAmerican athletes and a negative fascination said Douglas A Blackmon the author of the Pulitzer Prizewinning book Slavery By Another Name and the host of American Forum a weekly show produced  the University of Virginias Miller CenterTwitter has long been the presidents preferred method for directing his outrage at individuals and those of all races have been his targets including Hillary Clinn James B Comey the former FBI direcr and Khizr Khan the Pakistani father of a fallen American soldierBut Mary Frances Berry who is AfricanAmerican and who served as the chairwoman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights said that Mr Trumps particular desire during his first year in office  lash out at AfricanAmerican sports figures was hard  ignoreIt just reinforces a theme thats already on their mind Ms Berry now a professor of hisry at the University of Pennsylvania said of the presidents tweets Its tailormade for him  spout off and reinforce his baseSpeaking  an adoring and mostly white crowd in Huntsville Ala in September Mr Trump referenced the actions of football players like Mr Kaepernick who knelt during the national anthem and said he would love  see an NFL owner say Get that son of a bitch off the field right nowMr Ball sked the confrontation with the president this week refusing on CNN  thank Mr Trump for his assistance and saying that I dont have  say  go around saying thank you  everybodyThat interview appears  have prompted the angry response from Mr Trump He insisted that he was the one who rescued Mr Balls son and he chided Mr Ball for refusing  give Mr Trump the due he felt he deservedMr Trump has repeatedly denied that his criticism of kneeling is aimed at AfricanAmerican players The issue of kneeling has nothing  do with race he tweeted in September And White House officials have said the presidents tweets are about patriotismThis isnt an usversus them This should be something that brings our country gether Sarah Huckabee Sanders the White House press secretary ld reporters in the days after Mr Trump first raised the issue All Americans should be proud  stand up salute that flag salute that anthem and be part of that processPolls suggest that many agree with Mr Trump One taken in September found that 49 percent of Americans agreed with the president that it was wrong for football players  kneel during the national anthem  express a political opinion compared with 43 percent who said they were right  do soIn some ways Mr Ball and Mr Trump are made for each other two publicityseeking individuals who rarely shy away from a good verbal fightIt was the success of Mr Balls eldest son Lonzo as UCLAs freshman point guard last season that gave Mr Ball a platform  build a brand Since then he has often let loose a series of attentiongrabbing statements including once claiming that  in his prime  he could have beaten Michael Jordan oneononeBut some of Mr Trumps critics say the presidents attack on Mr Ball was about more than just chestthumping between the two men They say it echoes what they view as an obsession  Mr Trump on sports figures who are blackHarry Edwards a civil rights activist and professor emeritus at the University of California Berkeley said that Mr Trump undersod that attacking black athletes  who are among the most popular figures in AfricanAmerican communities  sent a powerful signal  some of his most fervent votersAll of these attacks resonate with a base that have some severe perspectives on AfricanAmerican equality and justice he said To attack AfricanAmerican athletes is really a way of sending that message that these are othersMr Trump has excoriated the NFL for allowing players  kneel which he sees as disrespecting the American flag In his tweet on Wednesday the president criticized Roger odell the longtime leader of the football league asking when will the highly paid Commissioner finally get ugh and smart This issue is killing your leagueMr Blackmon said Mr Trumps focus on the actions of the players suggested that he ok a particular affront when his expectations of their behavior was not metThis consistent pattern  AfricanAmericans who stand up in a sense  him who do not seem  be sufficiently compliant  seem  draw particular ire Mr Blackmon saidMarc Tracy contributed reporting from New YorkCollapse,sports
MELBOURNE Australia  Three days after the sixtime Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic bowed out in the urnaments second round pranked Andy Murray followedMurray a fivetime runnerup in Melbourne was unable  counter the unrelenting net play of 50thranked Mischa Zverev falling  75 57 62 64 in a fourthround match on Sunday afternoon at Rod Laver ArenaThe last time neither Djokovic nor Murray reached the quarterfinals at a major event was when they both lost in the fourth round of the 2007 Australian Open Then seeded 14th and 15th they lost  Roger Federer and Rafael NadalIn Sundays final match the pranked woman Angelique Kerber followed Murrays ungainly lead Kerber the defending champion put up little resistance in a 62 63 pummeling  35thranked CoCo VandewegheZverev ambushed Murray with spectacular net play skyhook overheads that fell near the line and stab volleys that just dipped over the net In an era dominated  baseline rallies Zverev disrupted Murray  going  the net 118 times in the 3hour34minute match winning 65 of those pointsZverev said his commitment  aggressive play had kept nerves from sabotaging the momentI was in a little coma and just serveandvolleying my way through it Zverev said in his oncourt interviewMurray said it was Zverevs execution not his tactics that proved problematic adding that his opponent had deserved  winI dont think its so much someone necessarily coming in its the shots he was coming up with when he did come forward Murray said I mean he came up with some great pickups you know reflex volleys especially at the end of the match when it was tight That was ugh because I was hitting some good shots chasing some good balls down Just wasnt meant  beKerbers destruction came in far different fashion with Vandeweghes bludgeoning serve and groundstrokes blasting through Kerbers soft defenses Vandeweghe hit 30 winners  Kerbers seven Many of Vandeweghes winners were struck close  the middle of the court after she had lured Kerber out of position with her previous shotWere two tally opposite players Vandeweghe said I would expect myself  have more winners as well as more unforced errors than she would haveKerber had looked far from invincible this season losing two of her three matches before this urnament then dropping sets in her first two rounds  opponents ranked outside the p 50Of course it was a little bit difficult at the beginning  get used  everything Kerber said of being the p seed at a major for the first time But when the urnament started I was doing all the things like I did last year was

defeating the No 16 seed Barbora Strycova 75 64 in the fourth round With temperatures soaring above 90 degrees Williams lost her first two service games and was broken four times over allStrycova a quick and clever player with some of the best footwork in tennis was able  save seven set points in the opening set  deploying serveandvolley on occasion  before Williams closed the set with a mishit backhand that landed short and surprised StrycovaWilliams failed  serve out the match at 53 in the second set but she broke Strycova in the next game It was a patchy performance Williams made 46 unforced errors and only 45 percent of her first serves But neither she nor her older sister Venus has dropped a set in reaching the quarterfinalsNor has Serena Williamss next opponent the No 9 seed Johanna Konta who won the event in Sydney this month and has carried that sparkling form in the Australian Open On Monday Konta defeated the No 30 seed Ekaterina Makarova 61 64  rallying from 41 down in the second setShes been playing really well Williams said She has a very attacking game I know her game pretty well I look forward  itIf Williams does know Kontas game well it is only  watching from afar This will be their first match and when Konta was informed during her oncourt interview that she would face Williams next the crowd in Margaret Court Arena let out a big Oooh as if Konta might be in grave dangerKonta laughed at the reactionBelieve it or not thats an incredible experience for me she said Shes one of the few players still playing who I watched growing up As a young girl wanting  be a professional tennis player its an incredible honorKonta added I will cherish every minute out thereMurray who ascended  the No 1 ranking for the first time in November finished last year as the sports most dominant player reeling off titles at Wimbledon the Olympics Shanghai Paris and the World Tour Finals Asked if that heavy workload had worn on him Murray said he would meditate on the possibilityI was full of confidence coming in the beginning of this year he said I prepared as best as I could but maybe have  have a look back and assess some things and see maybe if theres some stuff I could have done differentlyZverev played not only a great match but a daring one risking exposure at the net  Murray one of the games best at passing shotsI cant stay on the baseline a couple feet behind the baseline try  outrally him Zverev said of Murray Hes very strong physically He has a good baseline game I knew I had  come in That was my only chance  win So yeah honestly there was no Plan B for meAggressive netrushing like Zverevs can lead  reward but also  embarrassment in this era of powerful baseliners Zverev has been on the wrong end of lopsided losses before 60 60  Federer in 2013 and 61 61  Nadal in Brisbane this monthI always say it takes longer  develop a serveandvolley game because I mean eventually youre going  get passed a lot Zverev said Especially when youre younger and you play p guys Like what happened  me two weeks ago in Brisbane against Rafa  he killed me 11 I really felt like I had no chanceHe added I feel like if youre younger and you feel something like that on the court you get discouraged quite easily You change  lets stay on the baseline lets try  get somewhat of a rhythm going I feel like its a very different mindset you need  have as a serveandvolleyer You need  go  the net get passed for two setsBut when the disruptive tactic works success can come quickly Zverev posted strong results last fall reaching the quarterfinals of two ATP events in China and then a semifinal in Basel Switzerland and reentering the p 100 for the first time since 2011Irina Zvereva Mischas mother taught her sons tennis with their father Alexander Zverev Sr She credited him with teaching Mischa how  volley a strength of the senior Zverevs own game when he was a Davis Cup player for the Soviet Union She said that their fitness trainer Jez Green who used  work with Murray had gotten Mischa in the best shape of his lifeWe want  say big thank you for this guy Zvereva saidZverev spent some time coaching while he was injured traveling  farflung Futures events Not the nicest places around the world he saidThough not instantaneous Zverevs rise up the rankings has been meteoric He was ranked as low as 1067th in March 2015 and 171st a year agoI realized A I missed playing myself and B I still felt like I could do some damage on court he said I felt like I was still pretty young and I started missing tennis myselfChrispher Clarey contributed

In bars VFW halls offices and living rooms Americans were riveted  the testimony of James B Comey the former FBI direcr before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday a moment of high drama about the conduct of President Trump the workings of American democracy and the threats of Russian involvement in the presidential electionFor some the proceedings were seen through the prism of the partisan divide For others they were less about Democrats and Republicans than about a dyspian sense that American governance has veered off the rails Here are four accounts from around the countryDENVER  The televisions at the Park Tavern in a leafy neighborhood near the Colorado State Capil are usually tuned  sports but on Thursday morning it was wallwall Comey as breakfast regulars sipped latemorning beers and aired their frustration and disgust with a political scandal that had dimmed their views of the presidentHes causing his own demise said Chad Cunningham 45 an Air Force veteran who has voted for Republicans and Democrats but sat out the last presidential election Hes not doing anything for this country except embarrassing usMr Cunningham said the former FBI direcr seemed honest and forthright a man with little  hide and little reason  lie To him Mr Comeys steady detailed delivery made Mr Trumps shootfromthephone Twitter habit seem especially intemperate and cavalier He said he would be perfectly happy if Vice President Mike Pence ok over for Mr TrumpBecause this is not working he saidAs the testimony unfolded on the TV screens Michael OBrien 55 a retired teacher hunched over his tablet earbuds inserted because he said the livestream from PBS was arriving just a few seconds earlier than the cable news feedIm afraid Im going  miss something he saidMr OBrien had nothing kind  say about Mr Trump or Republican politicians and commentars who have defended him and his campaign during the Russia investigation He said he was disturbed  Russian hacking and interference in the last election and was shocked more people were not equally outragedMr OBrien and the woman sitting next  him at the bar Sherry Wing often argue politics When he criticized the president Ms Wing would often respond that the country needed  come gether after a divisive election and give him time  grow in the office She said she still believed that  an extent but as the testimony played overhead she was developing another viewHes just a spoiled rotten ba Ms Wing said Lets move forward What are you going  do  make this country betterMs Wing a registered Republican who tends bar at an American Legion post voted independent last November out of distaste for both Mr Trump and Hillary Clinn She said she was not much fazed  political corruption as old as America or the revelations of Russian meddling in the election a distractionBut Ms Wing was dismayed  what she believed the investigation had revealed about Mr Trumps temperament and characterWhat the hell does this have  do with anything Ms Wing said Bring back our jobs Bring back our dignity JACK HEALYGROVETOWN Ga  The water wer here includes a rendering of an American flag and just above Grovewns name d Bless America Soldiers from Fort rdon fill restaurants gas stations and retail shopsBut though it was easy  find a television beaming out Mr Comeys remarks many people found other things  focus onI think a lot of people have run with one little bit and now its a big mess said Deborah Barnes 61 who has run Hairys Barber Shop for about 18 years I would argue a lot of people  just regular Joes  see it the same way and thats why they elected Donald TrumpMs Barnes dressed in a black barbers smock with Debbie embroidered in red had the hearing on in her shop About an hour in Mr Comeys testimony her cusmers had paid little attention she saidI dont even think that anybody noticed it being on she said Theyre just interested in getting a haircutAlthough Ms Barnes said she was paying some attention  the days proceedings she said she viewed the hearing as unlikely  settle any of the questions that have dogged Mr Trumps presidencyIt is a big mess said Ms Barnes who does not use Twitter and said she was a sparing user of Facebook In my opinion some of the senars are just out  get anythingShe added Whether youre Democrat or Republican your president is your damn presidentIn near Augusta Santria Swinn 32 was watching the hearing as she cleaned at a hotel where the asking rate for a room on Thursday night was 97 As she moved among rooms on the fourth floor she was switching televisions  CNN so she could listen  Mr ComeyI just want  know whats going on she said as she paused for a moment at the door of Room 409 the white comforter on its bed already adjusted just so Im just taking it all in Im just nosyAt the Harlem Ga Huddle House across the street from a mural of Laurel and Hardy the Comey hearing was playing on one television and ESPN on another But neither appeared  be getting much attentionA family sat in a booth closest  the television where Fox News was playingI just think its propaganda Erin Mallory 39 said as she sod behind the counter and a child screamed from elsewhere in the restaurantMs Mallory said she would catch up on Mr Comeys comments laterI think its just more noise she said ALAN BLINDERCHICAGO  In a quiet back room of a bakery here three friends gathered Thursday  sip coffee watch CNN and analyze every syllable Mr Comey said about a president they loatheI didnt want  see the highlights said Chris Sne 40 who ok the day off from his job in advertising  watch the hearing I didnt want  see the spin afterwards I really was looking for the direct conversationsA couple of hours in Mr Sne said he heard enough  conclude that Mr Trump  a man he described as awful and dirty  had tried  manipulate Mr ComeyI think this is just the tip of the spear in terms of this investigation Mr Sne saidSeated next  him Tari Toppe 42 said she thought there was possibly enough information now  pursue impeachment of Mr TrumpI was kind of hoping they would get enough out of this  look in obstruction of justice said Ms Toppe a massage therapist and stayathome motherTheir friend Kira Kurka 43 was enjoying a carrot cake muffin and paying close attention for any evidence that Mr Trump may have colluded with Russia When Mr Comey dodged a question on that pic Ms Kurka responded with displeasure Come on give an answer she said Thats why were hereBut even Mr Comeys nonanswer spoke volumes Ms Kurka said He has something he just cant say its something that has  be in a closeddoor session because its something big that could maybe lead  impeachment speculated Ms Kurka a phographer who said she was procrastinating on work in order  watch the hearingMr Sne Ms Toppe and Ms Kurka all voted for Mrs Clinn in last years presidential election and all expressed fears about the state of American democracy under Mr TrumpBut the three friends agreed that Mr Comeys public testimony was a positive step a sign that investigars were taking the Russia issue seriously and that wrongdoers might be held accountableThey credited senars from both parties who asked ugh questions They scoffed as Republicans kept mentioning Mrs Clinns email serverMr Sne said the hearing had been a good thing for transparency for the American people And he said patience was needed as the investigation continued  unfoldHopefully Mr Sne said Americans arent expecting that this is going  be a quick conclusion MITCH SMITHPHOENIX  A burlesque dancer a former Army ranger and a  Depot sales clerk sat around the darkmahogany bar at Ole Brass Rail on Thursday morning having a drink at the end of a shift or filling their smachs at the start of a workday The 18 television sets on the walls cusmarily show Diamondbacks or Cardinals games But not Thursday morningMr Comey was testifying before Congress so the bartender Kathie Larsyn tuned in  ABC and put up the volume figuring everyone wanted  hear what Mr Comey had  sayAt the bar located on a busy corner between a checkcashing center and a Mexican restaurant the political persuasions vary but many regulars are united  their distaste for politics these days The dancer Kitty Vicrian voted for Hillary Clinn The ranger Abel Candelaria voted for Donald Trump The salesman Terry Gaines did not bother  cast a ballot last NovemberIn this slice of Arizona a state that last voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996 the debate around the bar on Thursday was not about red or blue ideology or about who was right  Mr Comey or Mr Trump There was only sporadic interest in what was being said and instead a dismissive sense about politics in generalThe whole thing is a circus said Mr Gaines 64 referring  the senars who are beholden  their constituents and Mr Comey who probably has his own agenda Then he returned  his plate of hash browns and scrambled eggsThe only time when everyone seemed  be paying attention was when Senar John McCain of Arizona asked Mr Comey about his investigation in Mrs Clinns emailsArent we talking about Russia Ms Larsyn asked her eyes trained on the screenIn the bar at least the conversation veered ward Russia and whether it interfered in the elections which pretty much everyone agrees is pretty crazy Ms Larsyn saidMr Gaines recalled the weekly duckandcover in school when he was a child and the fear that he and everyone had of a nuclear attack  the former Soviet UnionNow they say Russia influenced the elections for president of the United States he said shaking his headDon Cross 82 who was sipping a Budweiser is a registered Republican who voted for Mrs Clinn because the alternative was terrible Nothing since the election has made him feel better about politicsThese days Im a skeptical he said I dont trust any of these people on TV I dont trust their motives FERNANDA SANTOSCollapse,sports

LIVERPOOL England  Josep Maria Barmeu the president of Barcelona preferred  focus on what he had gained rather than what he had lostWe have earned 105 million or about 127 million he said and there is more  invest in football in assets Lets see what we doAlmost exactly five months later the watching world now has an answer What Barcelona has done with all of that money all of that opportunity is sign Ousmane Dembl a 20yearold French winger of bright promise for an initial 126 million and allocate even more  upward of 175 million the secondhighest fee in hisry   the transfer of Philippe Coutinho Liverpools Brazilian playmakerBut the when is still uncertain Jamie Carragher the former Liverpool defender might be expected  feel his former club should keep hold of one of its crown jewels until the end of the season The best thing for Liverpool  do he wrote on Twitter this week is  agree on a BIG fee for Coutinho  leave during the summer warning that Liverpools place in the p four would be seriously risked if he departed this monthFrom the players perspective while it is a move he has long craved the timing is less than ideal Such a drastic change of scenery in a season that leads in a World Cup carries a little more risk than a key figure in Brazils plans might like even if escaping the brute physicality of the Premier League might be an attractionThat is not  say there is no logic  it Allowing Coutinho  earmarked as a longterm replacement for Andrs Iniesta  a sixmonth period  settle in would allow Barcelona  see him flourish more fully next season More immediately a move now also might ease the domestic workload on the 33yearold Iniesta meaning the teams coach Ernes Valverde could reserve him for Champions League adventuresFar more important than when however is why As recently as September Barcelonas direcr of professional sports Albert Soler claimed the Neymarinspired hyperinflation of Europes already superheated transfer market was a model of football we are not used  and insisted that Barcelona wont get involved in thatYet whenever Coutinho joins Barcelona will possess two of the most expensive players of all time PSG and Manchester City might have started the fire but Barcelona is happily fanning the flames and it is doing so at a time when the club most at risk of being burned is Barcelona itselfIt is now almost a decade since Pep Guardiola ok charge of the team that would change soccer In the summer of 2008 Guardiola was promoted from manager of Barcelonas B team after only one season and handed the reins of a senior side that included Lionel Messi Gerard Piqu Iniesta Xavi Hernndez and soon Sergio BusquetsXavi  now in lucrative semiretirement in Qatar  apart the spine of that team remains in place It has been graceful  watch  Barcelona always is  but it is an aging team its beauty slowly dimming its glory gradually fading Busquets is a comparative spring chicken as is Ivan Rakitic both 29 Messi Piqu Iniesta and Javier Mascherano are all the wrong side of 30They are still expensive though Last year Barcelona announced record revenues of 854 million when its chief executive Oscar Grau boasted that even teams in the NFL and NBA did not make that much moneyPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersThe clubs salary bill accounted for an eyewatering 63 percent of that clubs are recommended  spend no more than 70 percent of turnover on salaries even before a spate of renewals  including

existence is perhaps a little more handmouth than the scale of its wealth might suggest Barcelona projects its revenues will increase again this year breaking the 900 million mark but then they will have  if the club is  keep pace with its rapidly inflating salariesWhen PSG deposited the 267 million check  cover Neymars buyout clause Barcelona had a chance  break that cycle As Barmeu said it was an opportunity and a golden oneFor years Barcelona has recruited desperately poorly It is a club that the worlds finest players would do almost anything  join  as Coutinho and Luis Surez before him prove  and yet its approach  acquisitions is haphazard and chaoticLast summer what was supposed  be a move for PSGs Marco Verratti somehow became the sale of Neymar A deal for Nices Ivorian midfielder Jean Michael Seri collapsed amid rumors that talks had only begun because Barcelona fans kept mentioning his name Liverpool held firm on CoutinhoLast month Atltico Madrid threatened  complain  FIFA about Barcelonas pursuit of Anine Griezmann The club might have added Dembl and Nlson Semedo last summer two bright young things but a midfield in desperate need of rejuvenation was bolstered only  Paulinho 29 signed from Chinas Guangzhou EvergrandeThe current league standings might not suggest it but Real Madrid has its future in hand Barcelona remains locked  its past seemingly unable  think about replacing the players that have brought so much success Barmeu has talked about reenergizing the production line of young talent from La Masia its famed academy but that seems more a pipe dream

Critics NotebookIt seems like Title IX investigars those charged with weighing the evidence in such cases might as well pack up their feathers nowObviously three plays isnt a reasonable sample size And it doesnt help much  add in an influential fourth David Mamets 1992 Oleanna a twohander about a student who accuses her professor of harassmentWe know that sexual assault on college campuses is both epidemic and underreported in part because women and men who have experienced assault doubt that they will be believed So is it o much  ask for a play that confirms the truth of an assault Or suggests that a victim wasnt somehow asking for it How about a play in which a character who has been harassed or abused is supported and believedOr is she Her abuser receives a slap on the wrist actually its more of a caress  marriage  a loving woman and Isabella herself a novitiate who has spent the entire play battling for her chastity is saddled with an unrefusable marriage proposal  an even more powerful man Shakespeare doesnt give Isabella any lines after that because once again  whom can she complainAnd Blackbird which played on Broadway two seasons ago ys for a while with the idea that sexual intimacies between a 12yearold girl and a 40yearold man might construe a love sry but it ultimately affirms that this of course was abuseI understand why playwrights like Ms Ziegler and Mr Colaizzo would be interested in twisty narrative structures and convoluted questions of truth A boy student assaults a girl student Its sad yes But  quote Shakespeare again its everydays news Its not a drama Its not a classical tragedy Who wants  write about a victim Its depressing Better  thrill an audience with some he said she said rightBut these convolutions have a troubling corollary They suggest that these women may be crying rape  out of vengeance or confusion or motives even more opaque  which helps  perpetuate the myth that a large percentage of rape accusations are falseSo these campus plays trouble me and I cant help but take them personally because  me these plays are personal I was assaulted in college though assaulted is a word I would never have used then and one Im reluctant  use now See Theres that dramaturgy again Assaulted How sad How boringStill some facts remain Theyre not all that fungible One boy crawled in bed with me and uched me while I was sleeping Another bullied me in accepting a back rub and then pinned my arms above my head while he rubbed himself against me until he finished There were other instances oI assumed I was somehow at fault Maybe Id led them on maybe Id sent mixed signals  those were terms I knew how  use After all these boys werent monsters they were my friends I liked them Under other circumstances I probably would have dated them Of course I didnt report them I stayed in bed with that first one and let him tell me how lonely he felt With the second I cleaned myself up and went back out  a party I turned the incidents in funny sries sries that dont seem so funny nowAs someone who has given her life over  sries Im going  insist that sries matter  the ones we tell the ones were ld What have I learned from sries from movies and books and music videos and plays in which the characters were close enough  uch That a woman should be pretty that she should be either fabulous or innocent that she should be desired rather than desiring that she will almost never say as much or do as much as a man If she does Then we get MedeaI dont want  be in the business of telling playwrights what they should and shouldnt write what they can and cant And I hope I understand the difference between documentary and fiction But Id like  see playwrights tell some other sries some better sries sries that more thoughtfully reflect what women and men experienceBut because of the sries Ive already absorbed because I also prefer snaking plots and complicated psychology I worry that I wont like those other sries I worry that I wont believe them And Ill have only myself  complain Collapse,business
At noon on Friday Donald Trump will become the 45th president of the United States Millions of Americans will rejoice at the sight and millions more will not As a rule foreign leaders dont attend the inauguration of American presidents but Russias president Vladimir Putin will be there in spirit To understand why and  understand whats happening as Trump takes over the White House we need  go back two weeksordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election Russias goals were  undermine public faith in the US democratic process denigrate Secretary Clinn and harm her electability and potential presidency We further assess Putin and the Russian vernment developed a clear preference for Presidentelect TrumpThe intelligence assessment raises the question what made Trump an attractive vehicle through which  attempt  weaken the liberal democratic order Why himTrump has flouted the norms of American elections and governance at every turn including calling for the jailing of an opposing candidate encouraging violence against protesters endorsing the rture of prisoners suggesting he might not respect the results of the election falsely claiming that millions of illegal votes were cast failing  resolve unprecedented conflicts of interest or  even disclose his tax returns and attacking a federal judge based on his ethnicity and thats of course a highly incomplete list I cant directly assess the IC report but its fair  say that the liberal democratic order is being disrupted both in the US and around the worldincendiary talk is an affront  elementary democratic decency and a breach of the boundaries of American political discourse Krauthammer added It takes decades centuries  develop ingrained norms of political restraint and selfcontrol But they can be undone in short order  a demagogue feeding a vengeful populismNorman Ornstein a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute sent me his thoughtsOne the Russians have known for a long time that Trump was susceptible  flattery especially from major authority figures Two he had a significant following in the US as a megacelebrity Three if he got engaged in politics it would be divisive  a good early example being his birther efforts Four he would perplex frustrate and divide Republican establishment figures most of whom were hostile  Russia but a divided major party serves  disrupt the democracy I doubt they thought he would win but he would encourage or exacerbate divisions in the society challenge many fundamental norms over his own narcissistic sociopathic views of himself and his entitlements and break a lot of crockery without a seconds misgiving His vicries with the GOP nomination and the election were unexpected icing on the cakeOne of our conclusions was that the Kremlin seeks out political and economic forces which weaken the Wests desirability credibility and moral authority It does this  make Russias neighbors less interested in seeking  cooperate and integrate with Europe or the US making them more dependent on Russia It seeks  undermine NATOs unity in the hopes of seeking a new grand bargain with the US in which the US will recognize Russias sphere of influence and will not interfere in its internal issuesConley continuedAgainst this backdrop during the presidential campaign Mr Trump was the only candidate that openly questioned Americas commitment  NATO and its commitment  defend the Baltic States He was the only candidate who was not very critical of Russias actions in Ukraine and Syria and chose  reframe them in ways that were in sync with Russian policy He has proposed a new relationship with Russia In other words based on Mr Trumps statements his views appear  align with Russian interestsThere are those who dispute the conclusions of the governments intelligence reportInstead of wasting more time debating the contents of the report Applebaum wrote on Jan 13 maybe we ought  abandon our obsession with secrets and spies and look at what is sitting in front of usHere is Applebaums caseFirst Trumps real estate empire relies though we dont know how much on Russian moneySecond Applebaum writesFourthFinally Applebaum argues as evidence of Trumps proRussia tilt thatTrump is willing  risk serious conflict with China  destroy US relations with Mexico  dismiss Americas closest allies in Europe and  downgrade NATO our most important military allianceAll this provides the basis for Applebaums conclusionTrump doesnt have  be a Manchurian candidate who has been hypnotized or recruited  foreign intelligence Its enough that he has direct and indirect links  a profoundly corrupt and violent foreign dictar whose policies he admires whose advisers he shares and whose slogans he uses Thats kompromat enough for meMany of the domestic and foreign policy experts I contacted suggested that Russia would not need  blackmail Trump  get what it wanted  that Trumps susceptibility  praise has made him vulnerable  manipulationDavid Leege a professor emeritus of political science at Notre Dame wrote meTrump was a willing but unwitting accomplice because he loved the flattery saw it only as a business opportunity and had so little understanding of international relations  recognize how affairs of state could be caught up in itAlong similar lines Sandy Maisel a political scientist at Col argued that Trumpsego is such that he never asked nor does he ask yet what playing in the Russians needs and desires meant for our system An unwitting  egodriven  ol of Putins goal  undermine faith in our system and in the Clinn candidacyGary Jacobson a political scientist at the University of California San Diego was outspoken in his response  my question asking why the Russians favored TrumpHis shameless mendacity narcissism authoritarian instincts inability  lerate opposition or criticism hostility  formal institutions and the media vast ignorance of foreign and domestic issues indifference  constitutional restraints and eagerness  whip up and exploit xenophobia and barely disguised racism We might add his affection for authoritarian leaders and other ugh guys Have I left anything out Probably All of these characteristics lead him  say things and propose actions antithetical  democratic norms and standardsPutin sees in Trump someone who is enormously susceptible  flattery which Putin is perfectly happy  provide in order  achieve his national objectivesPutins major objective Wertheimer wrote  email is break up the Western alliance and he appears  see Trump as an excellent vehicle  achieve this goalVladimir Putin has seized the momentum of this unraveling exacting critical damage  the underpinnings of the liberal world order in a shockingly short timeThis threat McKew warns should not be taken lightlyThe West is already at war whether it wants  be or not It may not be a war we recognize but it is a war This war seeks at home and abroad  erode our values our democracy and our institutional strength  dilute our ability  sort fact from fiction or moral right from wrong and  convince us  make decisions against our own best interestsSpecific leaks may take aim at powerful individuals but in the longer term kompromat serves the interests of the powerful which is why it is often a ol of aucrats By eroding the very idea of a shared reality and  spreading apathy and confusion among a public that learns  distrust leaders and institutions alike kompromat undermines a societys ability  hold the powerful  account and ensure the proper functioning of governmentMr Trumps version of reality got a boost There was no such thing as truth only a battle of opinions proffered  different acrs each of whom strives  be loudestThis means that we are facing the prospect of a renegade commander in chief armed with the considerable powers of the executive branch and a seemingly compliant legislature Trump has already dealt a body blow  the political process We will soon learn how much harm he can inflict once in officeCollapse,business

Common SenseTheres an old saying hard cases make bad law Perhaps a corollary should be easy cases make good lawAfter Mr Marma learned from Dr Gilman that the trials had been largely a failure SAC was able  trade on the stillconfidential information generating profits and avoiding losses taling 275 million Mr Marma earned a 93 million bonus for his effortsDr Gilman testified against Mr Marma at trial Despite the overwhelming evidence of his guilt Mr Marma has never acknowledged any wrongdoing or shown any remorse His steadfast refusal  cooperate with the government meant criminal charges were never brought against Steven A Cohen SACs founder who remains one of the worlds richest men and who is now back in business at his new operation Point72 Asset ManagementGiven the circumstances of the case it was no surprise when Mr Marma was convicted in 2014 and sentenced  nine years in prisonMarma wasnt a hard case said John C Coffee Jr a professor at Columbia Law School and an expert on whitecollar crime In fact its one of the easiest insidertrading cases Ive ever seen While the appellate panel may have overreached in its eagerness  limit the damage from Newman he said the upshot is that the odds have again swung  the prosecurs advantageBoth the Newman and Marma appeals turned on the relationship between the person who conveys inside information the tipper and the person who receives and trades on it the tippee To be guilty of insider trading the tipper needs  personally benefit directly or indirectly from the disclosure the Supreme Court has heldUntil Newman this benefit was construed quite broadly and could easily be inferred if the tipper and tippee were relatives friends or even acquaintances But in Newman the Second Circuit held prosecurs  a much higher standard ruling that the relationship must be a meaningfully close personal relationship that generates an exchange that is objective consequential and represents at least a potential gain of a pecuniary or similarly valuable natureThat meant the traders who passed on and traded on inside information in the Newman case went free The fact they were business school classmates who had worked gether at the same company and known each other for years wasnt a close enough relationship the court ruled Prosecurs had  dismiss the convictions and guilty pleas of seven people whod participated in insider trading schemes in some cases reaping millions in profit including Michael S Steinberg one of Mr Cohens p lieutenantsThat set the stage for Mr Marma  argue that he likewise had no close personal relationship with Dr Gilman and that the docr didnt reap any gain from disclosing the informationBut the Marma case proved  be a vivid illustration of a truism about inside information on Wall Street there are few true gifts The relationship between tippers and tippees is almost always complicated  personal ties and expectations of future benefits  monetary or emotional or both Wall Street operates like a big favor bank Mr Coffee saidThe relationship between Mr Marma and Mr Gilman seems an especially poignant example As Sheelah Kolhatkar author of Black Edge a gripping account of the Marma case and the Cohen investigation ld me this week One of Dr Gilmans two sons committed suicide He was estranged from the other He was lonelyMr Marma who had proven adept at charming older menrs throughout his career over time insinuated himself in Dr Gilmans life in what investigars described as an intellectual seductionThen after receiving the inside information he wanted Mr Marma dropped him Hi Mat I havent heard from you in a while Dr Gilman wrote after several months of silence I just wonder how youre faring Dr Gilman never saw him againAt an emotional moment at Mr Marmas trial Dr Gilman testified that Mr Marma had come  remind him of the son hed lost  suicide It was so sad  see this elderly distinguished docr whod pleaded guilty and lost his career his reputation virtually everything hunched over on the witness stand having  reveal all this Ms Kolhatkar recalled He was a tragic figureNone of this drama actually figured in the Marma decision Robert A Katzmann the chief circuit judge who wrote the opinion for two of the judges on the panel the third wrote a dissent didnt need  consider the nuances of the relationship and how Dr Gilman might have benefited or suffered emotionally because the two had a straightforward financial relationship Dr Gilman earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees from Mr Marma and so he had every reason  ingratiate himself  divulging the informationMr Marma will most likely seek a rehearing  the full court and if that fails appeal  the Supreme Court But the odds of his prevailing have turned drastically against himAt this juncture his case essentially resres insidertrading law  where it was before Newman roiled the waters Absent a muchneeded  but unlikely  congressional statute that would clarify many confusing aspects of insidertrading law thats probably as it should beThe problem with Newman Ms Kolhatkar said is that it completely misundersod the way the world actually worksCollapse,business
Off the ShelfRic Edelman disappoints in his new investing book left Gary Smith offers financial formulas  help identify value scks in his new book Money MachineWith the sck market up substantially since the first of the year and technological innovations continuing  roil the corporate landscape how should you invest right nowTwo new books offer very different answers with each taking an unconventional approachIn the far better one Money Machine The Surprisingly Simple Power of Value Investing Amacom 2795 Gary Smith a Pomona College economics professor says you should concentrate on value scks In contrast in The Truth About Your Future The Money Guide You Need Now Later and Much Later Simon  Schuster 26 Ric Edelman says you need  figure out how  capitalize on trends disrupting how business is typically doneLets begin with Mr Smith who does an excellent job explaining his positionInstead of trying  predict shortterm zigs and zags in sck prices value invesrs evaluate individual scks and the market as a whole  looking for good companies that have low sck prices relative  their dividends earnings and assets he writesMr Smith uses an analogy  make his caseThink of a sck as a machine that generates cash every few months  cash that happens  be called dividends he writes The key question is how much you would pay  own that machine in order  get the cash This is the scks intrinsic value Value invesrs buy a sck because it is an inexpensive money machine generating bountiful cash it is hoped over many yearsThroughout the book Mr Smith provides financial formulas  help you identify value scks and his writing is clear and often clever For exampleThe book however does have its flaws  one major a couple minorThe big one first It is perfectly defensible  pick one approach  investing  such as loading up on value scks companies with solid revenues earnings and dividends that are trading at a relatively low price  over all others As Mr Smith points out a number of times Warren E Buffett is a value invesr And this reviewer understands that Mr Buffett has done quite wellBut financial mavens like Mr Buffett the maestro of Berkshire Hathaway are rare and as Mr Smith himself points out very few invesrs think they are below average even though half are Most of us would be better off with a widely diversified portfolio something Mr Smith barely acknowledgesAs for the minor nits Mr Smith tends  digress mentioning academic papers he wrote that are at best tangential  the concept of value investing For example he says that scks with ingenious ticker symbols such as MOO for VanEck Vecrs Agribusiness ETF tend  outperform the market That is a fun fact  especially for us financial nerds  but I am not sure what it has  do with the matter at hand and I would not recommend an investment based solely on a cute nameSimilarly while it is possible that a home could be viewed as a value investment as he explains I am not sure the discussion was worth 20 pages of a 300page bookThese are small quibbles For the most part he states his case wellThe valueinvesting philosophy is simple he writes Look for great companies whose scks are inexpensive relative  their dividends and earningsThat clarity and brevity are lacking in Mr Edelmans book He is a financial planner but readers expecting detailed investment advice will be disappointedFor example after writing that it is vital  diversify your investments among scks bonds cash and perhaps other investments such as real estate how does Mr Edelman respond  his rherical question how much of your portfolio should be placed in each of those assetsLike this The answer is  it depends I wish I could provide you a more specific answer right now but this is just a book on personal finance  its not a private indepth meeting with a financial planning professionalHe doesnt even offer general guidelines He just moves onThis is already my pick for the most frustrating personal finance book of 2017 And one of the reasons I am so annoyed is that the premise was so promisingFinancial planning is all about anticipating and preparing for the future Mr Edelman writes So  understand what your future will be like you need  understand why its going  be so radically different from what you have been assumingHe then devotes about twothirds of his more than 300 pages  underscoring things we know but can easily forget Medical advances could make us live longer everevolving technology will provide more engaging entertainment options and rapidly evolving workplaces will require continuous education perhaps extensive enough for us  have  leave the workplace for a while  concentrate on learning new thingsSo far so good But what do these changes mean for the way we invest Well when it comes  leisure and learning for example Mr Edelmans advice is just this Expect  spend lots of money on travel and recreation  and this will need  be facred in your financial plan How There are no detailsAbout as specific as he gets is  say Invest in a globally diversified portfolio Maintain that portfolio for a very long time Strategically rebalance the portfolio as needed and include companies that are using or developing exponential technologiesThe what  invest in how much of your portfolio it should represent and whats a very long time are left  you That isnt much help when you are trying  determine how  invest dayCollapse,business
Black political power is declining in cities across the country including Oakland St Louis Cleveland and Atlanta  even as AfricanAmericans are gaining majority status in an increasing number of suburbsAt the same time AfricanAmerican emigration  the South has started  weaken Republican control of some deep red statesIn the report McElwee argues thatThe fact that big donors  overwhelmingly white male and highincome  hold such outsized influence in a city that is extremely diverse both demographically and economically is deeply problematicAt the same time Bowser lost the three poorest black wards 57 and 8 which have a median household income of 42177 and where single family houses cost an average of 250000 in 2013  large margins Ward 7 across the Anacostia River in the Southeast corner of the city backed Gray over Bowser 5948 percent  280 percentHispanics who are likely  hold the balance of political power between whites and blacks have grown from 21 percent of the Districts population in 1970  106 percent in 2015 AsianAmericans have gone from 07 percent  42 percent over the same periodWhile these percentages still give AfricanAmericans a plurality of the District population turnout patterns in offyear local elections in which the mayor is chosen serve  weaken black voting strengthThe turnout gap between rich and poor wards was even larger 784 points in the 2014 contest In the most affluent four wards median household income 95257 the turnout rate of registered voters was 3083 percent in the four poorest wards median household income 49520 the turnout rate was 2299 percentA surge of young mainly white voters living in newly affluent neighborhoods emerged as a powerful force in last Novembers elections in the District a seismic shift that mirrors the evolution of the citys population and could reshape its politics in years  comeThe Post found that in the 2014 primary blacks made up 48 percent of voters compared  51 percent other In the general election which included a referendum on legalization of marijuana that brought many young white voters  the polls blacks were 46 percent  53 percent otherIn the event of a future racially polarized Democratic mayoral primary pitting a major black candidate against a major white candidate Hispanics would be in a position  determine the outcomeThere are some indications of how Hispanic voters might cast their ballots The February 1989 Chicago mayoral primary provides perhaps the most relevant case studyIn an email Pisn wrote that the findings constitute suggestive evidence that in a white vs black election Hispanics could provide a vicry for the white candidate because Latinos tend  view whites more favorably than blacksPisn cautioned however that the policies espoused  the white and black candidates could also play a crucial roleLatinos are more egalitarian than whites and more comfortable with big government If the black candidate was  the left of the white candidate in the scenario you describe with respect  these two core values and if Latinos voted with these two core values in mind this would draw Latinos on balance  the black candidateI contacted a number of politicians operatives researchers and political scientists  get their assessment of the likelihood that the District will elect a white mayor and got a mixed responseI see no reason why the city cant elect a white mayor While I in no way think we are in a post racial era I do believe that most of the citizens of the city would have no genuine bias on this issue In fact the younger folks who have made up most of the citys growth spurt are far more welcoming of differences than their elders Like any successful mayoral candidate the politician would have  speak  issues relevant  those in the city with a plan  tackle crime affordable housing and continue the improvement in the business climate  achieve job growth etc but I certainly think it could be doneMatthew Green a political scientist at Catholic University said the prospect of a white mayor is absolutely clearly possible He noted that major sections of the city have been transformed in most cases resulting in more whitesThe city has been changing pretty dramatically There are neighborhoods I dont even recognize anymoreThere are however some dissentersGarry Young direcr of the Center for Washingn Area Studies at George Washingn University downplayed the possibility that Washingn could elect a white mayor noting thatAfricanAmericans remain the largest racial group in the District with close  50 percent NonHispanic whites still only make up a tad more than one thirdYoung also pointed out thatThe dynamic that seems in play now is you have black candidates who attract the business community and white voters in Northwest and then do well enough among black and Latino voters elsewhere  win the Democratic primary Thats a proven winning strategy Could a white candidate put gether the same sort of coalition Possibly  and one day probably as I think the Districts continues  become whiter  but I think its still a longshot in the short runHal Wolman a political scientist at George Washingn put an entirely different spin on the questionOne of the biggest differences is on the question whether blacks and white have the same opportunities for jobs 74 percent of whites say yes compared  40 percent of blacks Another major difference is on the question of whether the American system of justice is biased against AfricanAmericans Blacks say it is  68  26 while 69 percent of whites say the system in not biased and 25 percent say it isDespite the particular demographic profile of the District the population trends in Washingn are emblematic of shifts taking place in a number of major citiesThe geographic movement of AfricanAmericans will produce a shift in black political power from some cities  surrounding suburbs and  states in the SouthGeorgia for example is a state where Democrats are making gains so much so that the Clinn campaign is considering a possible drive  win what has been a solidly red state The slow but steady increase in the percentage of Georgia residents who are minorities is crucial  this processBy far the dominant trend however is the migration of AfricanAmericans from center cities  the suburbsmetropolitan areas in the growing parts of the country are registering the greatest numeric gains in suburban black population The suburbs of Atlanta Housn Washingn DC and Dallas experienced the largest increases in black population during 20002010Driving the movement of AfricanAmericans  the suburbs Frey wroteare the young those with higher education and married couples with children  attributes that characterized white suburbanization for almost a centuryPolitically the migration out of cities  the suburbs will lead  some diffusion of black political power but not necessarily  a diminishmentOver time AfricanAmericans in the Washingn metropolitan area may be forced through demographic change  cede some power in the District which has a population of 672228 At the same time AfricanAmerican control of Prince Georges County might be an avatar of a deeper transformation The county not only has a population of 909535 but it also has a member of Congress who can actually vote unlike the Districts quasicongressional representation By most standards this is not a bad dealA focus on the blackwhiteHispanic urban splits can serve  obscure what is possibly a more salient development the ongoing political alignment of welleducated

politics And the redistribution is not winwin Rosenthal wrote adding thatidentity politics is a matter of social justice that has had limited economic benefits for white males throughout the income distributionThe meaning of a college degree Rosenthal points out has changed over the yearsThere has been a large expansion of the botm tier with relatively more students graduating from Cal State

Common SenseMr Trump I have a deal for youI know your tax returns are being audited and you dont want  give the Internal Revenue Service any more ammunitionI accept your sons representation that they run  thousands of pages and are o complicated for the average voterSo just give us this your adjusted gross income and actual federal taxes paid for the last five years certified  your accountants Thats a tal of 10 numbers which would fit on a single pageThose are numbers any taxpayer can understand They wouldnt tell the IRS anything it doesnt already knowAnd while they wouldnt answer many of the questions that have swirled around your finances they would lay  rest once and for all the most basic question How much if anything do you pay in federal taxesThe issue has taken on new urgency after this weeks presidential debate when the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinn boldly suggested that Donald Trump doesnt want the American people all of you watching night  know that hes paid nothing in federal taxesMr Trump hardly clarified the matter treating Mrs Clinns remark first as a compliment  That makes me smart  and when questioned after the debate asserting Of course I pay federal taxesIts worth noting that this is the first time in American hisry that the question has had  be asked of a serious contender for the presidencyHopefully it will also be the last time if Congress finally requires all presidential candidates  release at least five years of returns just as federal law requires presidential candidates  disclose their assets and sources of income That would prevent the kind of timeconsuming and needless speculation that Mr Trump has generated from ever again being an issue in a national electionI think Trump and all candidates should do so Douglas HoltzEakin an economist and tax expert ld me this week Mr HoltzEakin served as direcr of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum a conservative progrowth advocacy groupAt this juncture its obvious that they are wasting their breath If Mr Trump had any intention of releasing his full returns he would have done so  now Thus my compromise a modest amount of disclosure that protects Mr Trumps interests while giving voters at least some of the information they need  make an informed choiceSo far Mr Trump has not taken me up on my offer or as might be expected from such a veteran negotiar made a counteroffer Hope Hicks a campaign spokeswoman did not respond  my messagesContrary  his claim that people would learn nothing there would be a wealth of relevant information of vital interest  many votersFor starters and assuming that any tax avoidance on his part is legal we would know exactly what loopholes in the tax code enable someone as wealthy as Mr Trump claims  be  pay little or no federal taxMr Trump has attacked loopholes that benefit others and has called for eliminating the tax treatment of socalled carried interest which benefits many hedge fund and private equity managers But has he called for changing any of the provisions that benefit himAt the very least he has yet  explain why these loopholes for real estate developers should be retained and how they benefit the publicIts also impossible  evaluate Mr Trumps broader tax proposals without knowing how they would affect him Mr Trump has called for taxing socalled pass through income such as that generated  limited liability companies and partnerships at a new low 15 percent rate  far lower than the p 33 percent rate he has proposed for individuals We know from his financial disclosure statements that most of Mr Trumps assets are held in the form of LLCs and partnerships So is this just another selfdealing benefit for Mr Trump or is it motivated  the public interestTheres no way  tell without seeing his tax returnsMr Trump has never been charged with any wrongdoing but theres a large gap between illegal behavior that can be proved beyond a reasonable doubt and what most people would consider appropriate conduct  a candidate for president What Mr Trump considers smart might be seen  others as evasive Candidate Trump should follow the precedent set  every major party presidential candidate  and president  since Nixon and release his tax returns Mr Rosenthal saidThat Mr Trump is being audited only strengthens the case for disclosure Mr Trump has repeatedly cited the audit as the reason hes not releasing his returns as he did again during the debate As many tax experts including Mr ldberg have pointed out Mr Trump is free  disclose his returns even if they are being auditedIf the IRS has questions about Mr Trumps tax compliance in his most recent returns voters should know what those questions are now  not after the election Imagine the spectacle if the IRS sues a sitting president for back taxesIndeed it would have been far better if Mr Trump had released the returns during the primaries when Republican voters could have considered themMoreover none of his arguments should prevent him from releasing earlier returns that are no longer being audited The Trump campaign has said hes not being audited for returns at least before 2009 Those and even older returns would shed light on how Mr Trump conducts his business and whether he has paid substantial federal taxHis returns would also help assess broader questions about Mr Trumps integrity By running a campaign that rests in large part on his claims of being a successful businessman and  a lesser degree a generous donor  charitable causes Mr Trump has put these matters in playThere are also less tangible but no less important reasons  release the returns Can someone who pays little or no tax if that proves  be the case relate  the average taxpaying American workerSpeaking  students at Drexel University in Philadelphia this week Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr responded  Mr Trumps debate interjection that not paying taxes made him smartTell that  the

Willets Point is dead Long live Willets PointStill bulldozers plowed over dozens of shops as the city used eminent domain  take some of the land and hundreds of immigrant workers lost their jobsBut on Monday the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio struck a deal with the original developers for a new version of the plan which will include 1100 apartments for low and moderateincome New Yorkers a 450seat school open space and retail on six acres at Willets Point Boulevard and Roosevelt AvenueNotably not part of the plan the mall Instead of pursuing remnants of the old plan the de Blasio administration will convene a task force with Melinda Katz the Queens borough president and Francisco Moya the local City Council member  fashion a framework for developing the remaining 17 acres at the site which is also known as the Iron TriangleRelated Companies and the owners of the New York Mets  Fred Wilpon and Saul B Katz  will remain as the designated developersThis is a happy and smarter ending  the first phase of Willets said Alicia Glen deputy mayor for economic development under Mr de Blasio who has made affordable housing a keysne of the administration This is a huge milesne for what we came here  doMs Katz said the new plan would finally put a shovel in the ground In 2008 Ms Katz then a City Council member had sponsored a bill supporting a prior proposalEven Tony Avella Jr a Democratic state senar who represents the area and has long opposed the development approved of the new concept Im not opposed  affordable housing he said Monday if its affordable  the people who need it mostBut that does not mean that planning for Phase II will be controversyfree Ms Katz has long favored building a soccer stadium at the Willets Point site near both the National Tennis Center and Citi Field In 2013 the Bloomberg administration came close  signing a deal with the New York City Football Club  build a 28000seat stadium on the siteYouth soccer leagues who were promised new fields loved the idea but park advocates opposed turning over park land  a private developerI am opposed  a stadium Mr Avella said We dont need itBut on a recent afternoon the work bays were empty in the few shops that remain Five men in bulky coats sat around a card table in 30degree weather on 36th Avenue waiting for the next cusmerIts bad for us said Nelson Bautista 42 who runs C  A Au Glass Its very quiet The cusmers see it on the news Its no more They go elsewhereThe rturous path of the Willets Point development  where the city has already spent 287 million on buying land cleaning it of the remains of hazardous chemicals and paying for the relocation of businesses  illustrates the difficulties of building in New York where projects can expect  encounter environmental hurdles community opposition litigation and the riptide of politics particularly when they fail  address the needs of local residentsThe Bloomberg administration first announced plans  redevelop Willets Point in 2002 Initially the administration identified the district as the location for housing Olympic athletes part of the citys unsuccessful bid  lure the 2012 Olympic Games The original plan called for 5500 apartments a hotel a convention center and retail on the entire 62 acres of the Iron TriangleMayor Michael R Bloomberg called for New Yorks next great neighborhood on a site littered with deeply potholed streets that were underwater whenever it rained Along the way the administration managed  anger property owners many of the 1700 people who worked in the Iron Triangle local politicians and near residentsEven some of the projects original supporters grew disenchanted as Mayor Bloomberg rejiggered the deal with developers Housing activists like Msgr Thomas Healy the now retired pasr of the near Our Lady of Sorrows Church who originally favored the developments 1900 units of affordable housing turned against itThe activists felt betrayed when a revised deal put the housing off in an uncertain future and under a 2012 plan agreed   the city a 14millionsquarefoot mall came  the foreIt was all about the mall the last thing Queens needs rather than anything  do with housing said Ms Glen They had the tail and the dog backwardsUnder the terms of that deal the developers were  remove xic materials at Willets Point with a city grant and build a mall with 200 sres a theater and a hotel The developers agreed  build 2500 apartments including 875 for low and moderateincome tenants but not until 2025 The developers had the option of paying the city 35 million  get out of that requirementAs the city moved  condemn the land Willets Point United a group of property and business owners filed a lawsuit In response  a separate lawsuit from Mr Avella and the City Club a small civic group a state court ruled in 2015 that the city could not use the parking lot next  Citi Field for the mall because it was park land Only the state Legislature can convert park land  other usesThe owners of the Mets were not keen on the idea nor were some elected officials Hoping for a compromise the city joined the appeal But last year the states highest court upheld the lower court decision and the project seemed  die againIn recent months the de Blasio administration has worked with Ms Katz and Mr Moya  craft a new arrangement with the developers The developers will be responsible for cleaning the site of xic materials  the end of 2020 with the first 500 of the 1100 apartments built  2022 according  city officialsThis project delivers big on the No 1 priority for people in Queens finding an affordable place  live Mr de Blasio said in a statement MondayOne of the three buildings will be reserved for older tenants and more than onethird of the units will be for households earning less than 43000 for a family of three more apartments than under prior proposalsWillets Point has been 12 years of bad politics and broken promises said Mr Moya Now we can look

The clearest pattern is simply that Trump has regained ground since Clinns postconvention peakWith the odds now favoring a narrow Clinn vicry what would the ramifications be after Nov 8 if she beats Trump  three or fewer percentage pointsIn fact the idea of the paranoid style as a force in politics would have little contemporary relevance or hisrical value if it were applied only  men with profoundly disturbed minds It is the use of paranoid modes of expression  more or less normal people that makes the phenomenon significantThe paranoia of the Trump campaign has found expression in the accusation that the Republican establishment in the primaries and now Hillary Clinn and her allies in the general election are committed  rigging the vote  prevent Trumps rightful accession  the White HouseI won South Carolina I won it  a landslide like a massive landslide and now theyre trying  pick off those delegates one  one Thats not the way democracy is supposed  work And you know they offer them trips They offer them all sorts of things And youre allowed  do that And youre allowed  offer trips and you can buy all these votes What kind of a system is this Now Im an outsider and I came in the system And Im winning the votes  millions of votes But the system is rigged Its crookedBig business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place They are throwing money at her because they have tal control over everything she does She is their puppet and they pull the stringsIts easy  see why Hofstadter describes the paranoid style asmade up of certain preoccupations and fantasies the megalomaniac view of oneself as the Elect wholly good abominably persecuted yet assured of ultimate triumph the attribution of gigantic and demonic powers  the adversaryTrumps strongest supporters do in fact feel abominably persecuted They are unlikely  fade away gracefullyA narrow Trump loss could be problematic in that some significant percentage of Republican activists would believe Trumps claims that the elecral system was rigged against himThis is a potentially dangerous outcome for the country Masket addedMasket is not the only one worrying that the legitimacy of the election  and potentially of future elections  could be compromisedNorman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute warned that if the outcome is a close win for Hillary ClinnIt will reinforce the view among Trump populists that the election was slen and he was stabbed in the back which will make the task of party leaders that much harder while creating further delegitimization of the processI think we have widespread voter fraud but the first thing that Trump needs  do is begin talking about it constantlySnes advice was that Trump should sayI am leading in Florida The polls all show it If I lose Florida we will know that theres voter fraud If theres voter fraud this election will be illegitimate the election of the winner will be illegitimate we will have a constitutional crisis widespread civil disobedience and the government will no longer be the governmentThe TrumpSne message is resonatingUS intelligence and law enforcement agencies are probing what they see as a broad covert Russian operation in the United States  sow public distrust in the upcoming presidential election and in US political institutionsMasket believes that a spreading suspicion among Trump supporters that the election outcome was fixed could have severe repercussions after Nov 8Part of the reason that our nation has been relatively free of political violence is that losers of contests have nearly always accepted their loss and opposed the vicr through legitimate means such as challenging them in future elections or working against their agenda in Congress The 2000 election was very close and obviously very controversial but Al re nonetheless conceded after the Supreme Courts ruling Were Trump and his supporters  continue  argue that the election had been slen from them it would mean that they reject nonviolent solutions  political differences It could jeopardize future elections undermine the legitimacy of the federal government and create an environment in which political violence becomes more likelyHes certainly creating a movement that will continue independently of him even if he does fold at some pointIf Trump continues  be a focal point for altright ideas those voters will demand a voice either in the Republican Party or outside it Can the conservative and mainstream Republicans unite effectively and keep the altright from steering the partyThe conviction that Democrats and the Washingn establishment will rig the election in Clinns favor is  no means limited  the altright Newt Gingrich the former House speaker and Rudy Giuliani the former mayor of New York have both promoted the ideaI mean if you assume that she is a crook as he says if you assume that she lies as he says why would you expect her  have an honest electionFrankly we think that the situation in the country  just like with the Democratic National Committees primaries  is a situation where if youre relying on the Justice Department  ensure the security of the elections we have  be worriedIn the New Jersey election in 2004 3611691 votes were cast and there were eight substantiated cases of individuals knowingly casting invalid votes Justin Levitt the studys author who is now deputy assistant atrney general in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice wrote He calculated that illegal votes amounted  00004 percent of the talAs could be expected the Brennan study has done little or nothing  tamp down accusations of election fraud from the altright and indeed from Trump himselfFiftytwo years ago writing in the year of the Johnsonldwater election Hofstadter proved remarkably prescient The right wing he arguedfeels dispossessed America has been largely taken away from them and their kind though they are determined  try  repossess it and  prevent the final destructive act of subversionShould Trump fail  eke out a vicry his already deeply suspicious supporters are likely  double down on allegations that they have been cheated out of what is rightfully theirs As Hofstadter put itEvery weekday get thoughtprovoking commentary from OpEd columnists the Times edirial

Perhaps the central situation conducive  the diffusion of the paranoid tendency is a confrontation of opposed interests which are or are felt  be tally irreconcilable and thus  nature not susceptible  the normal political processes of bargain and compromiseHofstadter wrote that at a time when polarization was a minor facr in politics The confrontation of irreconcilably opposed interests is far more hostile day which Hofstadter foresaw with such focused intensity that it is worth quoting him at lengthThe situation becomes worse when the representatives of a particular social interest  perhaps because of the very unrealistic and unrealizable nature of its demands  are shut out of the political process Having no access  political bargaining or the making of decisions they find their original

Many tax experts say a key element  any fundamental overhaul is getting rid of certain deductions for businesses  the specialinterest giveaways that are masked as tax breaks as House Republicans describe many of them in their own proposal That is the only way tax rates for much of the country can go down without starving the Treasury the experts sayBut there is a major roadblock  that fundamental change and it comes from a secr well known  the president the real estate industryAs the nations first real estate developerpresident  one who has refused  divest his holdings while occupying the Oval Office and has declined  release his past tax returns  Mr Trump brings his career perspective  the tax question as well as a substantial financial stake in the outcomeHis interest

prowess is formidableTheres probably no special interest thats more favored  the existing tax code than real estate said Steven M Rosenthal a real estate tax lawyer and senior fellow at the centrist UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center Its really hard  take that industry onMuch of the attention will focus on the tax deduction for interest payments  businesses a provision that Mr Trump has used  great advantage in what little has been seen of his past tax returns The House Republican plan calls for eliminating the deduction as part of an overall plan helping offset lower tax rates The nonpartisan

would enhance benefits  developers like himselfTrump said he knows where the loopholes are but so far he hasnt proposed closing any of them Mr Rosenthal said Maybe he will But so far he hasnt made any of the hard decisions that would show hes willing  close the loopholes that benefit him in order  make the tax code more fair and efficientCertain tax breaks in fact seem  exist solely or primarily  benefit the real estate industry with dubious benefits or even harmful effects for the broader economyMr Trumps campaign staff indicated last summer that he wanted  keep the interest deduction But then Mr Trump came out in favor of another key element of the House Republican plan immediate deductibility or expensing of capital expenditures rather than the practice of depreciating assets over timeTax experts broadly agree that the interest deduction is untenable if the code also allows immediate expensing Thats because many invesrs would borrow large sums  make capital expenditures like buildings immediately deduct all of the cost and continue  deduct the interest payments  double dipping as Mr Rosenthal put itMr Rosenthal put it bluntly Coupling an interest deduction with expensing is ridiculousIn response  the criticism Mr Trump pivoted and said he would give taxpayers the option of either taking the interest deduction or expensing capital expenditures not both But that adds yet another layer of complexity and would be even more costly for the Treasury since taxpayers would presumably choose the option that resulted in the lower tax billMoreover it is hard  see a path ward reducing overall corporate tax rates  the crucial element in making any overhaul palatable  a wide swath of businesses  without the added revenues from eliminating the interest deductionIndividuals generally cannot deduct interest payments  with the major exception of mortgage interest another boon  the real estate industry albeit one that also benefits millions of homeowners Mr Trump has said eliminating the mortgage deduction is off the tableThen there is the ability of active real estate invesrs such as Mr Trump but virtually no other group  deduct their real estate losses against other income That loophole was eliminated for most invesrs  including real estate invesrs  in the landmark tax legislation in 1986 But because of aggressive lobing  the powerful real estate industry including Mr Trump himself Congress passed legislation in 1993 resring the tax break for socalled active real estate developersAlan Cole an economist at the Tax Foundation said it was difficult  estimate how much that provision costs the Treasury because the underlying data is not availableWhether Mr Trump would still qualify as an active real estate invesr now that he is in the White House and has handed over management of his business interests  his sons is an open question Ordinarily an invesr has  spend 750 hours a year working in real estate  qualify which would be hard  reconcile with Mr Trumps presidential dutiesAnother loophole for real estate developers is the socalled likekind exchange provision which allows real estate invesrs  defer or even eliminate capital gains tax  using the proceeds from a sale  reinvest in a similar property which does not have  be all that similar  just about any real estate can be exchanged even an apartment complex for vacant landSince Mr Trump has not released his tax returns the public doesnt know whether and  what extent he benefits from the provision but nearly all real estate developers use likekind exchanges  avoid capital gains tax The Real Estate Roundtable strongly backs the provision Mr Trump hasnt said whether he would retain it But it is another specialinterest loophole that nearly all tax experts would eliminateThe Tax Foundation estimates that taxing likekind exchanges would generate 92 billion in additional revenue over 10 yearsAdvocates of a tax overhaul often point  the 1986 act as a model for a comprehensive approach that ushered in a long period of economic growth Given the power of the real estate lob presidential leadership was crucial said Leonard E Burman direcr of the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse UniversityReagan made tax reform a central campaign theme and mustered bipartisan support in Congress Reagan didnt get in the details Mr Burman said But he made the calls he gave the speeches and he got people excited about the idea of fixing our broken tax systemIts hard  imagine President Trump doing that he said Because at the end of the day the existing tax code is great for people like himCollapse,business

Leaders on the Democratic left who want  represent the havenots face an obstacle their own votersKeith Ellison a congressman from Minnesota and a candidate for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee argues that Democrats have  stand for a strong populist economic message He warns that the way the working class is always controlled is that its dividedA key Ellison supporter in the fight for the chairmanship Senar Bernie Sanders believes thatDemocrats are focused o much with a liberal elite which is raising incredible sums of money from wealthy people in the upper middle class but has ignored  a very significant degree the working class and the middle class and lowincome people in this countrya global race  the botm  boost the profits of large corporations and Wall Street  outsourcing jobs undercutting worker rights dismantling labor environmental health food safety and financial laws and allowing corporations  challenge our laws in international tribunals rather than our own court systemThe problem facing Ellison Sanders and their allies is that despite the success of Sanderss presidential campaign the Democratic elecrate has actually become less receptive  populism over the past two decadesMark Muro the direcr of the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings analyzed the differences between those communities that supported Hillary Clinn and those that backed Donald Trump The findings of Muro and Sifan Liu a Brookings research assistant suggest that Democrats who are calling for a return  progressive populism will encounter more hurdles than they expectThe lessthan500 counties that Hillary Clinn carried nationwide encompassed a massive 64 percent of Americas economic activity as measured  tal output in 2015In other words the Clinn counties are the ones in which the economy is booming they are hardly fertile terriry for a worker insurrectionMuro enlarged on his findings in an emailThese industries encompass the nations tech secr at its broadest and most consequential Their dynamism is going  be a central component of any future revitalized US economy As such these industries encompass the countrys best shot at supporting innovative inclusive and sustainable growthThe importance of these industries does not sp thereThe upcoming trade vote in Congress is about one thing Americans who work hard for a living Its about whether we slow down and change the terms of a bad trade deal so that it benefits working people  those Americans who lay awake at night wondering how theyre going  make ends meetEllisons argument rings especially true in those counties Clinn lost but in the counties where she and other Democrats won strongly free trade has been enormously beneficialIn other words as Muro made clear in his emailshows that trade dislocation measured in trade adjustment assistance certifications is far less concentrated in Clinnite large metros than it has been in Trumpian rural countiesFrom 2009  Ocber 2016 Democratic voters have shifted from a lukewarm protrade stance 4837 11 points in favor  a decisively protrade position 5631 The Democratic elecrate is moving in a protrade direction in opposition  Ellison and SandersConversely the Republican elecrate egged on  Donald Trump has flipped As recently as March 2014 before anyone gave a thought  a Trump presidential bid Pew found that Republican voters were solidly in the free trade camp 5536 By Ocber 2016 Republican voters had become decisively antitrade 6824If anything Trumps adamant opposition  free trade agreements and his call for the adoption of protectionist tax and tariff policies are likely  push Democratic voters who oppose Trump  shift even further in favor of tradeThis pushme pullyou phenomenon can be seen in at least two other areas  in attitudes ward the Russian president Vladimir Putin and ward Julian Assanges WikiLeaksAmong Democrats during this same period Putins negative ratings worsened from minus 52  minus 62An even more dramatic shift can be seen in the case of WikiLeaks the conduit for the release of the hacked Democratic Party emailsIn June 2013 well before the campaign when WikiLeaks was best known for publishing secret government documents Republicans were adamantly critical  negative 47 points By August 2016 when the damage  WikiLeaks  the Clinn became apparent Republicans had turned favorable  9 points  December Republicans were solidly positive in favor of WikiLeaks  27 points This is a 74point shift in just under three and a half yearsDemocrats once more moved in the opposite direction with their disapproval of WikiLeaks moving from negative 3 points in 2013  negative 28 points this monthLooking again at free trade the problem for Democrats struggling  find common ground on the issue is that as Gary Jacobson a political scientist at the University of California San Diego observed in an emailthe pull is stronger than the push people react more strongly  losses from free trade than  prospective gainsIn effect even though a majority of Democrats may support free trade the minority has in many cases suffered from the uneven distributional impact  shuttered local facries and jobs shipped overseas Those harmed  a policy are much more likely  vote on the issue than those helpedAlthough Trumps protectionist proposals  deal with trade and outsourcing could prove disastrous  economic growth over time he has offered the business community carrots tax breaks and contracts and sticks tariffs and tax penalties that have for the moment stifled industry opposition and allowed Trump  win over millions of votersDemocrats addressing trade and globalization concerns face not only a base sharply split over these issues but also growing difficulties in the partys traditional responses  employment dislocation Both job training and education have become increasingly ineffectiveAn August 2016 study  Robert G Valletta an economist at the Federal Reserve in San Francisco Recent Flattening in the Higher Education Wage Premium shows that since 2010 the steadily rising economic gains from completing college and even more so from a graduate degree have leveled offThe swelling number of workers with postsecondary education combined with the worldwide economic slowdown have resulted in a process economists call skill downsizing Those with graduate degrees are forced  take jobs that a college graduate could do college graduates are forced  take jobs that someone with less education could do and so on down the line leaving fewer and fewer good jobs for the newly trained or retrainedDespite Trumps nostalgia for a gone era when the United States was insulated from global trade spping or slowing trade is not at issue Global trade volumes  imports plus exports  have grown from 25 percent of global GDP in the mid1960s  60 percent day In the United States that same metric has grown from 10 percent  30 percentBernstein and Wallach go on  point out that trade agreementsare not mainly about cutting tariffs  expand trade nor are they about jobs growth and incomes here in the United States Rather theyre about setting expansive rules of the road that determine who wins and who losesThe problem is not with trade itself which the authors recognize is both desirable and inevitable but lies instead in the design of the negotiation processWith 500 official US trade advisers representing corporate interests having been given special access  the policy process while the public press and largely Congress have been shut out it is not surprising that corporate interests have thoroughly captured the negotiating process and ensured they are the winners under these rulesBernstein and Wallach make a potentially constructive attempt  deal with one aspect of the Democratic Partys key dilemma the struggle  prevail in national elections while accommodating the conflicting interests of diverse constituencies  including the conflict between the SandersWarrenEllison wing and the freetrade wingConciliation along these lines has become more difficult as international competition crosses national boundaries indifferent  domestic regulation and legislation The 2016 election demonstrates beyond a shadow of a doubt that ducking and weaving around the anguish of displaced workers guarantees sustained minority statusThe nations displaced work force includes not only the white working class but millions of Hispanics and AfricanAmericans who are loyal  the Democratic Party Effective and muscular policies focused on reversing the devastation that globalized trade aumation and competition with foreign workers have inflicted on middle and lower income Americans are essential  encourage defecting whites  return  Democratic ranks  and they are also crucial for reviving Election Day enthusiasm among the nations growing population of minority voters In this regard the political desires of the two groups are not

Common SenseHedge funds have been failing over the last year at the fastest rate since the financial crisis in 2008 Some crashed and burned after sudden reversals Others quietly liquidatedThen theres Edward S Lamperts ESL Investments It hasnt failed but may be setting a benchmark for slow painful declines thanks  its outsize longterm bet on two venerable retailers Sears and KmartSears said that the statement reflected a new more stringent accounting rule and that the company was in no imminent danger of bankruptcy We are a viable business that can meet its financial and other obligations for the foreseeable future said Jason Hollar Searss chief financial officerStill coming after seven straight years of huge losses the announcement seems a milesne on a road that has only one likely endIt takes a retailer like Sears a long time  die said Greg Melich senior managing direcr and head of consumer research for Evercore and the last Wall Street analyst still covering Sears Its been burning through over a billion dollars in cash every year Thats not sustainableSears Holdings has long been ESLs largest investment along with other Sears assets Mr Lampert spun off such as the struggling Lands End The two holdings accounted for nearly half the funds holdings at the end of the year according  its most recent securities filings Sears Holdings shares were 162 in 2006 this week they were barely above 11Few hedge fund managers have been as celebrated as Mr Lampert in his heyday which now appears  be the mid2000s Mr Lampert was a Wall Street wunderkind a ldman Sachs intern whose intellect ingratiating personality and prodigious work ethic attracted the patronage of some of Americas most prominent and successful invesrs Robert Rubin Mr Lamperts menr at ldman Richard Rainwater who invested for the billionaire Bass brothers before starting his own firm and David Geffen the billionaire entertainment mogulMr Lampert was 25 years old and at the vanguard of the hedge fund movement when he founded ESL in 1988 with 28 million in seed money from Mr RainwaterNo one compares Mr Lampert  Mr Buffett anymore His highprofile invesrs are for the most part long gone Mr Tisch whos also a direcr of Sears is described as steadfastly loyal Steven Mnuchin Mr Lamperts roommate at Yale and now Treasury secretary disclosed last year that he had a 26 million investment in ESL Mr Mnuchin said he would divest the positionNotably a group of ldman Sachs clients who had invested 35 billion in 2007 bailed out of the fund in 2013 Their exit pretty much says it all as far as invesr confidence in Mr Lampert goes Mr Melich saidWhere did someone as smart successful and hardworking as Mr Lampert go wrong His initial concept  combine two iconic but deeply distressed retailers  Kmart and Sears  initially appealed  many invesrs as a classic investment in undervalued poorly managed assets in the Warren Buffett style But Mr Buffett doesnt personally manage his portfolio companies Several former Lampert invesrs ld me that Mr Lamperts fundamental mistake was one common  many oncesuccessful hedge fund managers hubris and the belief that investment prowess would translate in management skillHe was a very successful invesr before he ok over Kmart and Sears said Mark Cohen former chief executive of Sears Canada and a professor at Columbia Business School where hes the direcr of retail studies Mr Cohen left Sears Canada before Mr Lampert arrivedHe seemed  think he was smarter than anyone in the retail business but he had no idea how  run the company from Day 1 Mr Cohen said One thing I teach is that core competencies are the basis for success or failure Lampert had no experience in retail and no management competency whatsoeverSears and other brickandmortar retail chains of course have been battered over the last decade  forces beyond Mr Lamperts control especially the rise of internet retailing Mr Lampert claims  have foreseen the trend If so hes had scant success carrying out a strategy  deal with itHis one consistent approach over the years has been  cut costs drastically Initially it seemed  work increasing cash flow and earnings Theres a philosophy  that Mr Melich said but Sears grossly underinvested in areas that proved  be very relevant  the future of merchandising such as multichannel retailingHe pointed  the contrast between Sears and  Depot whose shares have nearly tripled in the last five years despite the internet and competition from AmazonMr Lampert has shown more prowess as a financial engineer and has seemingly squeezed Searss once formidable assets for every penny of value through a continuing series of asset sales spinoffs dividend payouts and loans secured  Sears assets Mr Lampert has emphasized that because he is Searss largest shareholder his interests are aligned with other Sears shareholdersBut the perception persists that many of these deals have benefited Mr Lampert more than shareholders since hes often on both sides of the transactionsOver the last two years alone Mr Lampert and ESL have extended Sears over 800 million in loans secured  Sears assets  nearly twothirds as much as Searss entire market capitalization of 12 billion That makes Mr Lampert and ESL the largest Sears credirs giving them vastly different interests than most shareholders ESL Investments holds 48 percent of Sears Holdingss equity and 32 percent of its tal longterm debt As credirs they could end up owning Sears if it reorganizes in bankruptcy while other Sears shareholders would be wiped outLast month Mr Lampert and the Sears board agreed  pay 40 million  settle a shareholder lawsuit claiming that Searss sale and leaseback of much of its most valuable real estate  a real estate investment trust  43 percent owned  Mr Lampert and his ESL hedge fund  was a blatant conflict of interest that harmed Sears shareholders Sears has denied any wrongdoing and said it had settled the suit merely  avoid protracted litigationMr Lampert has stripped Sears of its assets Mr Cohen said Its the longest liquidation in retail hisry His reputation in the retail community is that hes a financial pirateLike most hedge fund managers Mr Lampert continues  get a management fee no matter how poorly the funds assets performStill Searss travails and their impact on ESLs results have clearly taken a ll on Mr Lamperts own fortunes Although Mr Lampert probably shows substantial gains on his original investment in Sears and Kmart he and ESL invesrs cant have fared very well over the past six or seven years Mr Melich saidMr Lampert remains one of the countrys richest people He owns lavish homes in Greenwich Conn Aspen Colo and Miami as well as a 288foot yacht Fountainhead named after the Ayn Rand novel Mr Lampert is a devotee of the author Last year Forbes ranked him tied for No 309 on its annual list of the 400 richest Americans with a net worth of 23 billionBut thats a billionandahalf dollars less than Forbes estimated back in 2006 Since then Mr Bezos has vaulted  No 2 on the Forbes list just behind Bill Gates with a net worth of 67 billion Had Mr Lampert simply put his fortune in a sck market index fund rather than gaining control of Sears and Kmart he would have fared far betterThrough a spokesman Mr Lampert declined  commentEven his critics concede that Mr Lampert has been stubbornly consistent refusing  throw in the wel on Sears even after years of deteriorating results In a news release last week he showed no signs of backing down pledging yet another fundamental restructuring of SearsHis strategy Cutting at

Beirut JournalBEIRUT Lebanon  The sightseers arrived in sensible shoes carrying water cameras and snacks as they might  a hisrical walking ur of Rome Paris or London But before they set off their guide a bearded ponytailed man who resembled a srybook Jesus warned them in jest There is no insurance for this ur which makes it very LebaneseOver the next four hours the guide Ronnie Chatah pointed out sites associated with Lebanons civil war discoursed upon the protests and assassinations that have punctuated the citys more recent hisry and even showed his guests what may or may not be the birthplace of Keanu ReevesThe ur which Mr Chatah gives every Sunday afternoon also seeks  bring  life the culture and hisry of a Middle Eastern capital better known internationally for its wars and assassinations than for its architecture and archaeologyWhile he mentions his fathers killing during the ur and points out his grave next  a mosque downwn he does not dwell on it and refrains from casting blame seeking  give what he calls an impartial tale of a complicated citys pastThe hardest thing  do is  access Beiruts hisry he said If you are walking alone youll miss the whole sryThat hisry is rather expansive A Mediterranean seafront city of about 22 million Beirut has been home over the centuries  Phoenicians Greeks Romans Arabs and many others Its last century alone has been packed with momenus events involving the Otmans the French the Palestinians a 15year civil war a war between Israel and Hezbollah the militant group and political party and a large refugee influx from neighboring SyriaBut there is little public commemoration of any of itMany of the citys hisric sites are neglected and unmarked or they have been bulldozed  make way for apartment blocks Scars from the civil war which ended in 1990 are everywhere mostly bullet holes and shrapnel markings on buildings But that conflicts hisry is not taught in public schools because the subject is still so contested and politically and emotionally sensitiveMr Chatahs ur is one modest effort  remedy this hisrical amnesia for anyone with 20 and four free hours on a Sunday afternoonThis week a few dozen people showed up in a plaza on the citys west side near an airline office and a cafe  take the ur They were a mix of foreigners and local residents  a Swedish couple with two boys some Italian aid workers an engineer for Lebanons national airline some British finance workers on vacation a woman with blue hairAfter an introduction Mr Chatah led the way through 13 sps pointing out landmarks telling sries and explaining the roots of Lebanons peculiarities On the steps of the Central Bank for example he explained how the countrys currency had crashed during the civil war leading it  be pegged at about 1500 Lebanese pounds  the dollar a rate that still standsThe group passed the First Armenian Evangelical Church where he talked about the Lebanese diaspora  Lebanese expatriates greatly outnumber Lebanese living inside the country  as well as the countrys complex political system and its 18 recognized religious sectsAnd standing between a beautifully maintained hisric mansion and an old house collapsing in a weedfilled lot he explained why development in the city had been so uneven Disputes between farflung relatives often prevented the unanimity needed  sell property and the government lacked the power  declare eminent domain and interveneThe most glaring example of such a property dispute he said involves Beiruts Holiday Inn He called it the largest headache we have in this city the headache we cant solveThe huge 26sry wer opened  great fanfare in 1974 but closed the next year when the civil war broke out and gunmen moved in  take advantage of its commanding views of downwn Yasir Arafat the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization moved in for a while but was later pushed out and the citys many other fighters struggled  control the building or shell their enemies who were holed up insideThe building is now a wering concrete shell covered with bullet holes its owners unable  agree on whether  sell it or redevelop the site Mr Chatah said They are waiting for Lebanon  be stable again he said I dont think that will ever happenOther sps included the old Jewish Quarter now a highsecurity zone where Saad Hariri the prime minister lives The only trace of Lebanons Jews nearly all of whom have left the country since the war surrounding the creation of Israel is the Maghen Abraham Synagogue a white building with yellow trim and Hebrew lettering above the entranceGiven the sensitivities around anything having  do with Judaism or Israel the synagogue is not open  the public It is not even visible from public streetsNear the end the ur spped in Martyrs Square the trafficclogged center of the city There Mr Chatah ld his ur group the Otmans once hanged people and the Lebanese protested against French rule and much later both for and against the presence of the Syrian Army in Lebanon The latter side got its way when the Syrians pulled out in 2005The ur itself has ridden the waves of Beiruts tribulationsMr Chatah began it in the late 2000s when urists traveling between Istanbul Cairo and Damascus often spped in Beirut He was soon giving urs seven days a week he saidBut after the conflict in Syria broke out in 2011 and a wave of new bombings and assassinations shook the city business tapered off and the urists were gradually replaced  aid workersI rode that roller coaster that went from urism  conflict urism Mr Chatah saidThen on Dec 27 2013 his father was killed and he decided  leave the country spending a few years in Scotland  write and grieveAs with most political assassinations in Lebanon there have been no investigations or arrests in his fathers killing he said But being away made him realize that he loved Beirut in a way he had not before So he returned last year and soon revived the urs considering them a tribute  his fatherMost people on the ur knew Mr Chatahs hisry but said it made little difference in how he laid out the citys hisryWe all have personal hisry here said Rosy Raggi who ok the ur with six other Lebanese friends His personal hisry is not as important as how he tells the sryCollapse,business
OpEd ContriburAs part of their giant tax bill Republicans in Congress are about  eliminate the Affordable Care Acts individual mandate Their objective is not sensible health care reform but rather insensible arithmetic that could satisfy the zantine rules governing the Senates reconciliation processThe purpose of the mandate is  evenly distribute risk among healthy and unhealthy Americans on the individual insurance market so that costs are shared and no one is left outWill killing the mandate ruin Obamacare exchanges No but it will transform them in an extended form of Medicaid  another name Americans with subsidized policies will stay in the system with help from the federal governmentUnsubsidized individuals however will be driven out of the market because a repeal of the mandate will cause premiums on exchange plans  skyrocket as healthy people exit Many of these people will purchase new strippeddown less expensive policies  courtesy of a Trump administration executive order  with the understanding that they can sign up for a more robust exchange policy at the next open enrollment period if they need full coverage in times of illnessAbout threequarters of those who buy insurance on the exchanges are subsidized  the federal government  reduce premiums  a specified affordable percentage of their income The loss of the mandate will not affect them But many healthy younger enrollees  who help  make insurance affordable  balancing the risk of sicker older people  will be driven away  higher premiums and without the mandate they would probably opt out  they typically didnt want  buy insurance anyway Unfortunately their exit will leave a higher average cost for those who are leftWithin a year or two of elimination of the mandate the individual insurance market will resemble the failed preObamacare days when preexisting conditions and high premiums made access impossible The difference is that the government will foot a large part of the cost through subsidies Before the ACA lowerincome people who didnt qualify for Medicaid were priced out of the individual market but with subsidies they can now purchase lowercost plans If the individual mandate is eliminated it will be middleincome people without subsidies who lose accessThe continuing high enrollment this fall supports the idea that most people still see the subsidized insurance offerings on the exchanges as a good deal As a result the demand side of this unusual market will stay strong for the subsidized cusmersHow will the insurance companies react They will see high demand for subsidized insurance as a tempting market in spite of past and future chaos The problem for them is that these cusmers are sicker and less predictable in their needs which makes it difficult  set a price This is precisely why the number of insurers this year has dropped so severely But managing uncertainty is at the core of this business Any risk is acceptable if the compensation is high enoughMany observers have been critical that only one or two Obamacare insurers offer plans in many counties But for the remaining insurers there is a silver lining monopoly Without serious competition and with the support of subsidies insurers can set premiums high enough  cover any contingency and virtually guarantee a good profit The high quoted premiums on the exchanges signal that insurers are anticipating these changes in the pool The remaining insurers will not run away In fact I expect those who stay will report record profits next year even without the mandate By now all those firms with a low lerance for risk have exitedHowever the timing of a mandate repeal is central Eliminating the individual mandate will make little difference  insurers in 2018 if the mandate expires in 2019 But Congress may decide  eliminate the individual mandate immediately Then insurers who priced their plans assuming continuation of the same hisrical enrollee pool will lose their shirts as healthier enrollees drop out Changing the rules halfway through the game is not something insurance company CEOs can anticipate but it is their biggest challenge nowA surprising result of eliminating the individual mandate would be an effective expansion of a plan that many Republicans in Congress would like  cut or abolish Medicaid Under the evolving Obamacare policies lowerincome enrollees are heavily subsidized  the government and the plans on the exchanges are largely offered  insurers specialized in Medicaid service  the statesWithout the individual mandate the exchanges will not die but will continue as zombies offering highcost coverage fed  the federal government and stumbling around the health system failing  serve their original purpose  access for all regardless of age health status or preexisting conditionsYet as long as the subsidies continue health plans will offer their policies on the exchanges with very high premiums While this may allow access for some who otherwise would be left out the grand purpose of the ACA   allow affordable care for all  will slip away Is this any way  do health policyJ B Silvers is a professor of health care finance at the

Common SenseThe bar for a chief executive of a public corporation  repudiate a United States president is extraordinarily high Corporate leaders arent given their power prestige responsibility and ninefigure pay packages  use the corner office as their personal soapboxWith President Trumps comments on white supremacists and other rightwing extremists ringing in the ears of Americas chief executives that high bar appears  have been passedSuch a public schism between a president and a business leadership long considered the backbone of the Republican establishment left corporate hisrians at a loss for precedent Theres never been anything  compare  this said Jeffrey A Sonnenfeld a dean of leadership studies at the Yale School of Management and the author of Firing Back How Great Leaders Rebound From Career DisastersCharles M Elson a professor and direcr of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate vernance at the University of Delaware said he knew of no other examples not even involving Richard Nixon at the height of the Vietnam War protests and during WatergateReferring  a tweet  Mr Trump criticizing Kenneth C Frazier the Merck executive who led this weeks corporate retreat from the White House councils Mr Sonnenfeld said Never in hisry has a president attacked and threatened the chief executive of a major US corporation like thatAfter provoking a furor with his initial failure  condemn the white supremacists behind last weekends violence in Charlottesville Va Mr Trump might have staved off a fullscale exodus with his somewhat stilted but conciliary comments on Monday But then he reignited the flames at a news conference on Tuesday at which he said there was blame on both sides including clubwielding members of what he called the altleft for the Charlottesville violence The white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and the former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke were quick  embrace his remarksAs pressure mounted on prominent council members like Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase Stephen A Schwarzman of the Blacksne Group Ginni Rometty of IBM and Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo as well as other chief executives who remained silent or issued platitudes corporate boards were hastily meeting  map strategy Ive heard from 24 chief executives in the past two days Mr Sonnenfeld said on Wednesday Boards are having ad hoc conference calls People are very worried and concernedThose conversations have been far more complicated than one might expect Its safe  say that no chief executive wants  be identified with white supremacy racism or domestic terrorism At the same time the president wields enormous influence over their shareholders employees and cusmersChief executives dont have the luxury of ventilating their personal political opinions whatever they might be Mr Elson said They shouldnt let their personal views influence their business decisions If they really feel strongly about something they can always resign and then say whatever they wantBack then Mr Sonnenfeld o praised Mr Trumps openness  business views as a welcome change from an Obama administration perceived as antibusiness Hes very charming and open  new ideas Mr Sonnenfeld said then of Mr TrumpThis week was a different sry After the Charlottesville events and Mr Trumps comments chief executives have a moral duty  use their position as a bully pulpit and  speak out Mr Sonnenfeld said adding that George Weyerhaeuser a former chairman of the giant timber and wood products company bearing his name had once ld him We have a license  operate from society and if we violate that license it can be revokedOr as Mr Elson ld me At some point if identification with the administration becomes so polarizing that it impairs your ability  run the company then you may have  do somethingWeighing the benefits of advising a president steeped in controversy versus the risks  shareholders and other constituents from potential consumer boycotts is a calculus that varies widely from company  companyThat new action appears  have arrivedThe risk of consumer blowback is especially acute for companies like Under Armour and youve seen this elsewhere in the retail space Mr Sonnenfeld said But he noted that speaking out against a social scourge like racism can also enhance a brand Taking a public stand doesnt mean theres a misalignment with shareholder interests he said It can be the right thing  do Howard Schultz has done this very effectively at StarbucksOn Monday Mr Schultz publicly criticized the presidents response  the Charlottesville events and on Wednesday he spoke at an emotional companywide meeting I come  you as an American as a Jew as a parent as a grandparent as an almost 40year partner of a company I love so dearly he said I come  you with profound profound concern about the lack of character morality humanity and what this might mean for young children and young generationsIn such circumstances collective action  business leaders is often the most effective course as members of the presidents advisory councils appear  have decided this week That way no one company bears the brunt of the presidents wrathAfter Mr Trumps comments about Charlottesville Mr Sonnenfeld has been among those calling for collective opposition Fomenting racial unrest is not in the nations interest and its not in businesses interest he said Divide and conquer has always been Trumps strategy and somehow it has worked until now The way  take a bully down is through collective actionCollapse,business
Common SenseIn response  widespread public criticism that the government has been o lenient with executives responsible for corporate crime Deputy Atrney General Sally Quillian Yates issued ugh new guidelines last year for federal prosecursIn Wells Fargo the government may have the perfect test caseWe should really hold the Department of Justices feet  the fire here said John C Coffee Jr a professor at Columbia Law School who is an expert on whitecollar crime Do they really mean what they said in that memo Will they pursue individuals and not just the underlingsBut calling for an investigation is easy compared with actually convicting highranking executives of a crime or even proving civil liability as the governments poor record with postfinancialcrisis mortgage fraud cases has demonstratedDespite the long odds and the layers of bureaucracy that typically insulate p executives from knowledge of wrongdoing Wells Fargo may prove the exceptionMary Eshet a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the bank had no comment beyond Mr Stumpfs testimony and other public statements this weekI disagree with the fact that this is a massive fraud Mr Stumpf ld the Senate Banking Committee Nonetheless he said he was fully committed  doing everything possible  fix this issue strengthen our culture and take the necessary actions  resre our cusmers trustBut opening accounts without cusmers knowledge even forging signatures  and then charging them fees  isnt some kind of gray area or borderline behavior As Senar Patrick J Toomey a Pennsylvania Republican put it this week This isnt crossselling its fraudUnder corporate criminal law Wells Fargo is strictly liable for the criminal behavior of its employees acting within the scope of its businessThe Justice Department has 10 guidelines for when it should pursue criminal charges against a corporation recently updated  reflect its more aggressive posture ward individuals Among the most important facrs is the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation including the complicity in or the condoning of the wrongdoing  corporate managementThis was an epidemic of bogus accounts Professor Coffee said This wouldnt have happened without pressure from the pWells Fargo has stressed that while the number of affected employees is large it amounts  just 2 percent of the banks tal work forceIf it was one person or even 100 you might argue that its a rogue contingent Professor Garrett said But you cant seriously argue that 5000 people have gone rogue Thats systemic behavior People above them had  have noticedThe behavior also spanned years Wells Fargo said it was reviewing cases dating back  2009Highranking bank officials certainly knew  2013 that the illegal conduct was pervasive Thats when The Los Angeles Times in an expos that did not get nearly the attention it deserved reported that Wells Fargo employees had opened unneeded accounts for cusmers ordered credit cards without cusmers permission and forged client signatures on paperworkAnother Justice Department guideline is the extent  which a company takes remedial actions once it becomes aware of illegal activity including steps  replace responsible management and  discipline or terminate wrongdoersWells Fargo said it had strengthened its moniring programs and stepped up manager training aimed at ferreting out and preventing wrongdoing It changed its incentive compensation Sales goals for retail bankers will be eliminated  though not until next year The bank said it had put in place a tal of 10 major reforms spanning several yearsBut Wells Fargo was extremely slow  pursue responsibility up the management chain let alone fire or discipline any highranking executive It hired outside consultants  help assess the problem only in 2015 and then only after the Los Angeles city atrneys office started investigatingThe highestranking management casualty so far appears  be Carrie Tolstedt the former head of Wells Fargos retail banking operations who retired  use the banks euphemism in July and was given a rousing sendoff with an exit package then worth more than 100 millionMs Tolstedt isnt talking so we havent heard her side of the sry The House Financial Services Committee which is holding its own hearing would like  interview her Mr Stumpf reiterated this week that Ms Tolstedt simply chose  retire after the bank decided  go in a different directionBut if it turns out she was in effect forced  resign for her involvement in the bogus account scandal the bank should have said so withheld her pay and started clawback proceedings Thats the minimum I would consider remedial action if I were a prosecurMs Tolstedt is surely at the p of prosecurs list of possible witnesssuspects strategically positioned  know just how high in the bank responsibility liesAs the Yates memo puts it By focusing our investigation on individuals we can increase the likelihood that individuals with knowledge of the corporate misconduct will cooperate with the investigation and provide information against individuals higher up the corporate hierarchyWhich leads  Mr Stumpf who as chief executive was paid over 100 million from 2011  2015 while the epidemic of bogus account openings was in full swingMs Warren was scathing this week You squeezed your employees  the breaking point so they would cheat cusmers and you could drive up the value of your sck and put hundreds of millions of dollars in your own pocket And when it all blew up you kept your job you kept your multimilliondollar bonuses and you went on television  blame thousands of 12anhour employeesMr Stumpf said that decisions regarding highranking executives including himself were matters for the board But why would the board be pondering those issues only now Surely direcrs have been aware of the pervasive nature of the problem for years  and if they werent kept informed that alone might be grounds for replacing Mr StumpfBut that should be no defenseEvery company says that Professor Coffee said But  survive these employees had little option but  cheat If they didnt meet the impossible targets theyd be fired This was very high pressure from the p where the p was being motivated  high incentive compensationIn sum I couldnt find a single Justice Department guideline that based on what we know now cuts in Wells Fargos favorWells Fargo says this is over Weve solved the problem it wont happen again Professor Garrett said Its mindboggling Fines arent working Were not going  see deterrence until we see some highlevel individual casesCollapse,business

WASHINGTON  The Trump administration and California are fighting a furious multifront legal war and every week seems  bring a new courtroom battleThe state has filed 29 lawsuits against the federal government since President Trump ok office on issues including immigration the environment and voting rightsThat same day Mr Sessions filed suit against the state accusing it of interfering with the sale of federal lands It followed a separate suit last month  block three state laws that sought  protect unauthorized immigrantsThis has happened throughout American hisry but under the Obama and Trump administrations it has happened more often he saidIn the Obama years red states tried  strike down the heart of the Affordable Care Act and succeeded in blocking a major immigration program Now we see the blue states battling Trump over sanctuary cities the census and other issues Professor Somin saidGreg Abbott now the governor of Texas used  say that his job description as the states atrney general was simple I go  the office in the morning I sue Barack Obama and then I go homeCalifornia has been doing well in court winning more than a dozen rulings against the administration Many of those vicries came from federal judges in the state and Mr Sessions may have been referring  them when he complained about ideological judgingThe state is also likely  receive receptive hearings when its cases reach the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco which has been a frequent target of Mr Trumps criticism The Supreme Court is a more attractive forum from the administrations perspective but the justices agree  hear very few casesThe lawsuits all have distinct features but collectively they pose fascinating questions about the Constitutions allocation of power between the federal government and the states They also give rise  a teachable moment in legal opportunismBlue states and blue cities are making arguments about limited federal power that are traditionally associated with the political right Professor Somin said On the other hand the Trump administration is staking out a very broad position on federal powerThe administrations legal arguments are substantial drawing on the Constitution and the law under which California was admitted  the UnionProfessor Levinson said her preliminary assessment of the suit was that it looks like the federal government has quite a strong argumentHe added Isnt there some irony in a DOJ headed  an ardent statesrightser Jeff Sessions arguing for federal preemption of state authority under the Property ClauseCalifornia has not yet filed its response  the suit Based on the Trump administrations complaint though the state law appears  be in troubleOne of the challenged laws for instance prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are  be released from state cusdyThe executive branch should be able  remove criminal aliens from a jail instead of your neighborhood Mr Sessions said in a statement on MondayMr Becerra responded Were not going  let the Trump administration coerce us in doing the federal governments job of enforcing federal immigration law Were in the business of public safety not deportationA second challenged law requires state officials  inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal government A third restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officialsResistance  unpopular federal laws  whether over tariffs or immigration or marijuana gambling guns or a host of other areas of possible conflict  is permissible they wrote only within the bounds of federalismThe administrations lawsuit seems likely  give rise  a split decision with courts upholding some but not all of the states lawsThe Constitution requires an actual enumeration of the nations residents every 10 years The information gathered is used  allocate congressional seats and  disburse federal moneyThe federal government should have an accurate count of who can legally vote in our federal elections Mr Sessions said on MondayThe administration said the citizenship information was needed  enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 but critics said that has not otherwise been a priorityCounting all people amplifies the voting power of places that have large numbers of residents who cannot vote legally  including immigrants who are here legally but are not citizens unauthorized immigrants and children Those places tend  be urban and  vote DemocraticThe Supreme Court did not decide whether other methods of counting were permissible Many political scientists say that the available information is not sufficient  count only eligible voters and the new census question may have been added in part  gather such informationThe states lawsuit has a decent chance of success The decision  alter the census form was sudden and consequential and courts may be reluctant  allow such a drastic changeThe Trump administration cannot manipulate federal grant fund requirements  pressure states counties or municipalities  enforce federal immigration laws Mr Becerra said at the timeA Justice Department spokesman responded that the state was putting the welfare of unauthorized immigrants ahead of public safetyProfessor Somin has written that attaching conditions  federal grants can be at odds with federalismIt is hard  say whether the state will prevail in its suit as much depends on how when and why the federal government denies funding But there is little question that some denials can give rise  constitutional problemsBut Judge William H Alsup ordered the administration  maintain major pieces of the program while legal challenges move forward notably  requiring the administration  allow people enrolled in it  renew their protected status The administration has not sought a stay of that injunctionIn a statement on Monday Mr Sessions expressed incredulity that the administration should not be able  rescind what he called an unlawful policy intended  usurp Congresss role in passing immigration lawsThe Ninth Circuit is set  hear arguments in the case in May and the states chances of winning in that court are good But the Supreme Court may well hear an appeal and there the state could face headwindsThe next major court fight between California and the Trump administration may involve greenhouse gas emissionsThe state has a waiver under the Clean Air Act that allows it  enforce stronger air pollution standards than those set  the federal governmentScott Pruitt the administrar of the Environmental Protection Agency has said he is dissatisfied with that state of affairsCalifornia Mr Becerra said is ready  file suitCollapse,business
Common SenseAs the presidential election approached they were falling all over themselves  predict a Hillary Clinn vicry and afterward a modest sck market rally The prospect of a win  Donald J Trump was so remote as  be deemed a black swan an event that was only distantly possible but would have potentially dire consequences for financial marketsAmong the many predicting a drop in equity markets in the unlikely event of a Trump vicry were analysts at Citibank JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley Keith Parker head of crossasset strategy research at Barclays forecast a drop of 11  13 percent in the Standard  Poors 500sck indexThe hedge fund Bridgewater Associates went even further warning clients that the Dow Jones industrial average would fall 2000 pointsWith benefit of hindsight whats extraordinary is how few professional invesrs saw it coming Mr Trump was derided as the candidate of uncertainty which markets typically abhor and many of his stated policies are vague incoherent or inconsistent But there was nothing uncertain about his overall progrowth probusiness and Americafirst tendencies now backed  the firepower of a Republican House and SenateHe is after all a real estate developerWe see tremendous opportunity for economic growth said John Engler a former governor of Michigan who is now president of the Business Roundtable an influential group of chief executives that was often at odds with Mr Trump during the campaign especially over trade and immigration Now that the results are in though Mr Engler sees a silver lining The Republicans understand he said that theyre on the spot  produce resultsSimon Lack founder of SL Advisors an investment advisory firm and operar of a mutual fund that focuses on energy carried the theme further Trumps win is unambiguously positive for many secrs of the economy especially energy infrastructure he saidThe doomsayers also ignored a century of market reactions  presidential elections Weve done extensive research that suggests presidential elections dont affect markets said James Stack president of InvesTech Research The reality is that the market is influenced  the greatest extent  economic facrs and monetary policyIn almost all technical and macro aspects this is still a bull market Mr Stack said and Mr Trumps election does not change thatMarkets generally rally the day after a presidential election said Jeffrey Hirsch edir of the Sck Traders Almanac because elections whatever their outcome eliminate a measure of uncertainty It doesnt matter if its a Republican or Democrat he said Returns tend  be higher when an incumbent president is replaced or the party in power changes as happened this week And previous instances of the election of both a Republican president and Republican Congress have been followed on average  a firstyear performance of 14 percentThere are more specific reasons as well that invesrs applauded Mr Trumps vicryEconomists generally agree that government spending can act as a broad economic stimulus as well as a boon for construction companies The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr Obamas stimulus plan saved 21 million jobs in the last quarter of 2009 bolstering the economy  up  35 percent and lowering the unemployment rate  as much as 21 percentConstruction company scks rallied on Wednesday Shares in Caterpillar which makes the heavy equipment used in most infrastructure construction jumped more than 8 percentWhatever their ultimate effect on deficits and interest rates  not  mention worsening income inequality  tax cuts are another form of economic stimulusTax modernization is our p priority said Mr Engler of the Business Roundtable arguing that it would substantially lift the economy a full percentage point beyond the growth rate of roughly 2 percent a year that it has been stuck in Weve said that if you want  grow gross domestic product  1 percent get tax legislation done The House Republican plan is a great blueprint One percent growth over 10 years would be 3 trillionNeedless  say Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts senar and Wall Street nemesis who Mr Trump mocked as Pocahontas will not have a starring role in a Trump administrationSome of the biggest beneficiaries of deregulation are likely  be banks drug companies and oil and gas pipelines On Wednesday shares in JPMorgan Chase rose 46 percent the biotech concern Biogen jumped more than 8 percent and the pipeline operar Kinder Morgan rose 45 percentWhether the Trump rally persists is another question In their rush  buy scks this week invesrs seemed all o willing  ignore Mr Trumps hostile stands on immigration and free trade as well as his seeming indifference  the federal deficit and the increased likelihood of higher interest rates All of those have the capacity  damp growth or even tip the economy in recessionMark Zandi chief economist for Moodys Analytics was like many others surprised  the strong market rally If we get a large stimulus on p of a fullemployment economy he said it may give you some juice in the near term but longer term its going  hurt  driving up interest rates and squeezing out other investmentsI was a strong advocate of deficit spending and tax cuts when unemployment was at 10 percent he said It doesnt make sense at 5 percentMr Parker of Barclays said he expected a selloff initially but also called for a recovery  yearend once invesrs absorbed signals from key economic policy makers What we thought would play out over weeks played out over hours he said pointing  Mr Trumps earlymorning vicry speech which made no mention of trade or immigration as one catalystLike many Mr Parker now sees more gains for scks if a Trump administration stays focused on a tax overhaul and fiscal policy if real interest rates stay low and if inflation picks up The backdrop was and still is generally supportive of risk he saidCollapse,business

posted a notice above the time clock informing workers that ICE was auditing their employment records a process that could take monthsImmediately workers began resigning and Mr Poindexter signed their

I dont listenThe fight has energized partisans on each side And it has squeezed those in the middle like Mr Poindexter  the people directly affected  the lawsIt also requires them  post notices

withheld because she is undocumented She said she hung on until Feb 16 close  the deadline for the company  submit paperwork  ICE so she could make another months rent The company said it was

knows ICE was here she saidEven before the law many of the states largest agencies like the Los Angeles and San Francisco Police Departments limited their work with ICE But agencies in more conservative areas have had  change their practicesThe California State Sheriffs Association was one of the most vocal opponents of the law What used  happen is that I would hand someone off while they were in cusdy ICE would escort them out and they would be gone said Sheriff Donny Youngblood of Kern County who was president of the association last year Now we have  turn them looseLast year before the law ok effect the Orange County Sheriffs Department turned over about 370 undocumented immigrants from county cusdy  federal authorities said Sheriff Sandra HutchensNow those people are going back in the community Sheriff Hutchens said We havent had any horrible incident that has occurred yet but when that happens the community is going  say  me Why were they releasedThe law on employer cooperation helps immigrant workers learn their rights and seek legal help if necessary its supporters say The law works first and foremost  protect Californians privacy at the workplace said Sarah Lovenheim a spokeswoman for Xavier Becerra the Democratic state atrney general She said she could not divulge whether the office had received any complaints about companies violating the lawMr Poindexter the walnut processor said he considered himself fortunate that the audit came after the harvest But his plant operates yearround and he is eager for ICE  finish its work so he can replace the lost workers before the fall harvest There is no point in hiring people with this cloud hanging over us he saidSome business owners even wondered if Californias attempts  protect undocumented

Common SenseIts hard  imagine a tax code more complicated than the one we already haveHillary Clinn has come up with oneThis isnt tax reform said Douglas HoltzEakin an economist who served as direcr of the Congressional Budget Office and is now president of the American Action Forum a conservative progrowth advocacy group Its antireform Shes layering on even more complexityHis views were echoed  a number of tax experts I spoke  this week about Mrs Clinns tax plans as I did earlier about Donald J TrumpsIn Mrs Clinns favor all the experts I interviewed said her proposals were more detailed transparent and consistent than Mr Trumps and even more important would not blow open an estimated 10 trillion hole in the federal budget over a decade as Mr Trumps proposals wouldIt has the important virtue of being fiscally responsible Leonard E Burman direcr of the centrist UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University said of Mrs Clinns plan It doesnt make our longterm fiscal problems worseTo varying degrees all agreed that Mrs Clinns proposal would increase taxes on the rich and big business but that it would add so many new layers of complexity that it would above all be a huge boon for tax lawyers Theres a lot of new complexity said Mr BurmanAlthough Mrs Clinns plan is intended  make sure that the wealthiest Americans pay more than they now do it leaves intact loopholes that allow wealthy real estate developers like Mr Trump  pay little or no tax which could serve as a vehicle for sophisticated tax lawyers  exploitDavid Kamin an outside adviser  the campaign on tax and budget issues and an associate professor at New York University School of Law said that the campaign was taking a close look at provisions benefiting people like Mr Trump and that her proposals did not purport  cover every loophole she might seek  close or change as presidentAs for complexity broadening the base and closing loopholes for the wealthy inevitably involve a certain amount of administration said Mr Kamin who emphasized that her proposals would simplify returns for small businesses and people with modest tax burdensThe experts generally praised Mrs Clinns proposals  benefit small businesses which include a provision that would allow them  immediately deduct up  1 million in capital investments which would ordinarily have  be depreciated Mr Trump has also called for immediately deducting capital investments but on an even wider scaleMrs Clinn has been frank in her acknowledgment that  pay for the many new social programs she has proposed she needs  raise revenue which she plans  do primarily through a tax increase on the richThe Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution estimates that Mrs Clinns tax plan would raise 11 trillion over the next decade the Center for Federal Tax Policy at the more conservative Tax Foundation puts the figure at 498 billion assuming no reduction in economic output from the tax increaseNearly all the increase would come from new taxes on the wealthiest Americans For those with adjusted gross incomes of more than 5 million she would impose a 4 percent surcharge on p of the normal tax system For those with incomes above 1 million she would install a 30 percent effective tax rate a version of what has become known as the Buffett rule after Warren E Buffett the billionaire invesr complained that he paid taxes at a lower rate than his secretary Mrs Clinns plan would also cap the tax value of deductions and exemptions at 28 percent and raise the estate taxShe would also close the norious carried interest loophole that primarily benefits hedge fund operars and private equity managers and unlike Mr Trump not give it back  means of tax cut on the wealthy taxpayers who take advantage of itThe Tax Policy Center estimates that the p 1 percent of taxpayers  those with adjusted gross incomes of more than 750000  would face an average tax increase of 78000 while the lower 95 percent  those earning less than 300000  would face little or no increaseBut over all Mrs Clinn has shied away from a sweeping tax overhaul Its more tinkering at the edges said Alan Cole an economist at the Tax Foundations policy center I wouldnt call it reform There arent any major reformulations  make the code simpler or fairer Its basically just a tax increase for the p income bracketIt goes without saying that raising taxes on the rich while leaving most of the existing tax code intact is anathema  Republicans and conservative economists as well as many centrist Democrats who have long held dreams of a bipartisan Grand Bargain  carry out a sweeping tax overhaul  improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the American economyI have admiration for the mechanics of the Clinn proposals Mr HoltzEakin said Theyre more detailed and structured than Trumps But I have serious concerns about the quality Their philosophy seems  be  give up on economic growth and try  deliver middleclass prosperity  taking from the richEveryone I interviewed criticized as fiendishly complicated and ineffectual what is probably Mrs Clinns most innovative proposal which is  put in place a graduated scale for tax rates on capital gainsUnder Mrs Clinns plan taxpayers reporting capital gains held for one  two years would pay their ordinary income tax rate which currently goes as high as 396 percent just as they do now for gains held less than a year Gains of two  three years would be subject  a 36 percent rate and after that the rate would decline  four percentage points each year until it reached the current longterm rate of 20 percent All rates exclude the additional 38 percent surtax on net investment income In effect there would be seven rate brackets for capital gains compared with two under the current codeAlthough this nominally raises capital gains rates for some assets it is not clear what if any effect it might have on overall revenue The Tax Foundation estimates that it would cost the Treasury 374 billion over 10 years because it would encourage invesrs  hold assets longer which would defer their taxes The Tax Policy Center says it would depress revenue in the early years as invesrs delayed sales but would eventually add 84 billion over 10 yearsBut the goal is not revenue its supposed  curb activist invesrs and others focused on shortterm results and persuade corporate executives  manage for the long term rather than for quarterly profit according  a speech Mrs Clinn delivered at New York University in July 2015However laudable the goal using the capital gains tax is a misguided approach said Mr Burman a view echoed  everyone I interviewedTheres no empirical evidence whatsoever this would have any effect on management decisionmaking Mr Burman said The real issue is corporate governance It would be better if management faced more not less pressure from invesrsHow did such an arcane proposal likely  appeal  a tiny sliver of voters even make it in Mrs Clinns tax planMs Tanden a close confidante and former campaign worker for Mrs Clinn succeeded the Clinn campaign manager John Podesta as president of the Center for American Progress the think tank that published the paper Mr Effron is a cofounder of Centerview Partners a Wall Street private equity and investment banking firm Mr Effron is also a major donor and fundraiser for the Clinn campaign and has been mentioned as a potential Treasury secretary in a Clinn administrationSecretary Clinn believes that American businesses need  break free from the tyranny of days earnings report so they can focus on innovating and investing for the long term said Mike Schmidt an economic policy adviser at the Clinn campaign Thats what this proposal is designed  advanceMrs Clinns proposals also do nothing  address the corporate tax rate which at 35 percent is the highest in the developed world though few companies actually pay anywhere near that rate President Obama called for reducing the corporate tax rate  28 percent in a compromise rebuffed  Republicans but Mrs Clinn would leave it at 35 percent and try  extract even more revenue  closing various loopholesYoud think the business community would be up in arms over this but I havent heard a peep said Mr HoltzEakin The focus on personalities has driven this off the radarSeveral experts cautioned as did the Clinn campaign itself that Mrs Clinns tax proposals might well evolve after the election should she become presidentDetails aside Mrs Clinns tax proposals offer a stark alternative  Mr Trumps and send a clear message that a p priority is increasing the tax liability at the p Mr Kamin saidThe message is that has  be a key element of any progressive tax reform Beyond

On Wednesday yet another courtroom battle promises  pull the White House in the legal spotlight as crucial arguments are heard in New York in a sweeping lawsuit that is challenging the administrations marijuana policy  seeking  legalize pot under federal lawIn its 98page complaint the suit presents its case for legalization not only through a host of constitutional arguments but also  way of a worldhisrical ur of marijuana use  from its first purported role 10000 years ago in the production of Taiwanese pottery  the smoking habits of President Barack Obama in his younger days It points out that the ancient Egyptians used the drug  treat eye sores and hemorrhoids and Thomas Jefferson puffed it for his migraines James Madison credited sweet hemp for giving him insight  create a new and democratic nation the suit notesThe suit also includes archival material quoting John Ehrlichman an adviser  President Richard Nixon saying that the early efforts  criminalize pot were a way  disrupt the hippies and the black community after the 1960s The contention is bolstered  an affidavit from Roger J Sne Jr a propot Nixonera operative and adviser  Mr TrumpThis is not the first time lawyers have sought  use the courts  question whether marijuana should still be classified as a socalled Schedule 1 drug under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act the most restrictive category reserved for the most dangerous narcotics Many of those efforts have come in criminal cases and judges  including those on the United States Supreme Court  have routinely upheld Congresss decision  make marijuana illegalThe current legal action is a somewhat rare attempt  use civil claims  legalize weed and has offered some novel arguments as  why its classification has violated the constitutional rights of those who filed the suitThe former football player Marvin Washingn for instance is contending that the Controlled Substances Act has impeded his ability  transact business in states where pot is legal in contravention of the Constitutions commerce clause The girl with epilepsy Alexis Bortell has argued that the law illegally restricts her right  travel with her medicine in states where pot is not allowed or  places controlled  the federal government  including on airplanes A third plaintiff the Cannabis Cultural Association a nonprofit group created  assist minorities in the marijuana industry has alleged the law has been used for years  discriminate against themIts the first time a young child who needs lifesaving medicine has sod up  the government  be able  use it said Joseph A Bondy one of the lawyers who brought the suit Its the first time that a group of young millennials of color has sod up  the government and said the marijuana law is wrong and has destroyed their communitiesAgainst these claims lawyers for the government have argued that Congress decided nearly 50 years ago that pot should be a Schedule 1 drug and if the plaintiffs dont agree they should try  change the law Their suit the lawyers wrote in one of their filings is the latest in a long list of cases asserting constitutional challenges  marijuana regulation under the CSA Those challenges have been uniformly rejected  the federal courtsNo matter how the lawsuit ends the judge who is considering the case Alvin K Hellerstein is clearly taking it seriously At a hearing in September Judge Hellerstein said he would give the matter his prioritized attention setting it ahead of all of his other casesThe hearing on Wednesday scheduled  entertain arguments  dismiss the case is very likely  be marked  a whiff of drama as marijuana activists from across the country are expected  descend on the courtroom Mr Bondy said he was also trying  arrange a livestream of the proceeding so that Alexis unable  travel  New York can watch it from her home in ColoradoWe might not have been able  do this 10 or 15 years ago Mr Bondy said But the climate is very different nowFollow Alan Feuer on Twitter alanfeuerCollapse,business
Common SenseFor President Trump 15 is the magic numberThats the percentage at which he wants  cap the corporate tax rate a steep cut from the current p rate of 35 percent and much lower than the ordinary income rates paid  many partnerships and smallbusiness entitiesTheres no doubt that a cut  15 percent would be big bold and hisric It might even be the biggest cut ever in corporate tax rates  use another superlative Mr Trump is fond of invokingIt might do wonders for economic growth level the competitive playing field and encourage United States corporations  keep their headquarters in this country and invest trillions in cash currently stashed in offshore accountsA 15 percent rate would take the United States from having the highest corporate tax rate among industrialized nations  having one of the lowest Britain is moving  17 percent Canadas federal rate has already gotten  15 percent and Irelands is at 125 percentAfter last weeks collapse of health care legislation many believe Republicans cant afford  fail again especially on what is widely considered their signature issue taxes As Scott A Hodge president of the conservativeleaning Tax Foundation ld me this week If the Republicans fail with tax reform it would be truly catastrophic Its really all or nothing at this pointTheres only one major stumbling block  a 15 percent rate and the conventional wisdom is that its an intractable one how  pay for itAccording  estimates  the Tax Foundation a cut in the corporate rate  15 percent would add 22 trillion  the deficit over 10 years on a static basis which assumes no additional economic growth After facring in growth and higher resulting tax receipts known as dynamic scoring the deficit would grow  1 trillion according  the foundationAnd if rates also go  15 percent for passthrough entities  businesses that pay taxes at individual rates like limitedliability corporations and partnerships  that adds another 15 trillion on a static basis and 13 trillion on a dynamic basis the foundation estimates A cut in passthrough rates has much less impact under dynamic scoring because individuals and small businesses spend far less on capital projects and thus do less  stimulate the economyPaying for corporate tax cuts of that magnitude is a tremendous challenge if you dont want  blow a hole in the deficit Mr Hodge said Anyone writing tax legislation will find that the options are very limitedHow big is the challenge In their tax blueprint House Republicans could only get the corporate rate  20 percent The 2014 proposal from Representative Dave Camp a Michigan Republican who was then the House Ways and Means Committee chairman struggled  reach 25 percent And when President Barack Obama nearly reached a grand bargain on tax reform with Republicans in 2013 he could only get  28 percent with 25 percent for some manufacturersThe math is really hard said Ray Beeman a tax expert at Ernst  Young and a former adviser  Mr Camp Theres really no big source of revenue that wont rile people upAnd yet 15 percent just might be possibleFor starters eliminating the deductions and loopholes in the corporate tax code would go a long way ward paying for a significant corporate rate cut There are so many of these that few companies actually pay the 35 percent statury rateCorporations benefit from all kinds of loopholes especially the one allowing earnings  accumulate offshore without being taxed said Steven M Rosenthal a tax expert and senior fellow at the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy CenterThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that in 2016 the corporate income tax raised 300 billion in revenue while what it called targeted subsidies cost about 270 billion In other words Congress could eliminate the subsidies and cut the corporate rate nearly in half without any significant loss in revenueAnother possibility would be  shift at least some of the tax burden from corporations  shareholders  raising tax rates on capital gains and dividend income Many economists favor that approach because it reduces the doubletaxation problem embedded in the current system Corporations pay taxes on profits and then when these are distributed shareholders pay The added tax burden would fall primarily on affluent taxpayers since they tend  own scks helping  rebut the argument that slashing the corporate rate would be a tax cut for the wealthyWhile its difficult  estimate how much additional tax revenue would be generated if dividends and capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income it would surely be substantial another big step ward a 15 percent corporate rateTaxing ordinary income capital gains and dividends at the same rate would also greatly simplify the tax code The notion does however run up against Republican orthodoxy that low capitalgains rates stimulate growthThere are many other ways  raise revenue of course House Republicans proposed a border adjustment tax popular with many progrowth economists which powerful retail interests shot down Most European countries fund their low corporate taxes with some form of a valueadded tax on consumption rather than income House Republicans have nodded in that direction but a valueadded tax runs afoul of many of the same interests that opposed the border tax and has never been popular in the consumptionfriendly United StatesEnvironmentalists and many economists would love  see a carbon tax which would presumably be repellent  an administration that is skeptical of climate change and wants  promote the coal industryThe point however is that if Mr Trump and Republicans in Congress are serious about a 15 percent rate without vastly increasing the deficit there are many ways  get thereThen theres the 15 percent passthrough rate While taxing small businesses and partnerships at the same rate as corporations has a superficial appeal theres nothing that says they have  be the same As the Tax Foundation maintains cutting rates on these businesses has relatively little impact on growth The House Republican blueprint was comfortable with a rate of 25 percent for small businesses and passthrough taxpayers still a significant reduction from current ordinary income rates And the 1986 reform act didnt require that passthrough entities pay the same rate as corporationsTheres nothing magic about 15 percent Mr Rosenthal saidThe closer the passthrough rate is  ordinary income rates the lower the incentive for lawyers accountants docrs and other service professionals  reorganize themselves in passthrough entities  avoid paying the higher rates How  distinguish individual professionals from actual businesses has long vexed legislars trying  rewrite the tax code A big issue has always been how do you prevent a passthrough owner who is really a wage earner or service provider from escaping the higher ordinary income tax rate Mr Beeman saidEveryone I spoke  mentioned that lowering corporate tax rates  anything close  15 percent requires political courage and leadership  overcome the powerful special interests that benefit from existing loopholes  starting with real estate Whether Mr Trump can set aside personal interests and rise  the challenge remains  be seenMany tax experts hope he willWhats important is not just getting a home run under his belt Mr Hodge said The Republicans have  get tax reform right They have  make sure it delivers the kind of growth that boosts productivity and real wages and living standards If they do get it right it can dramatically improve the lives of the people who feel most aggrieved about globalization and the state of the economy  the same people who voted for TrumpSecond in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might

John B Anderson a former Republican congressman from Illinois who bolted his party  run as a plainspoken independent candidate for president in 1980 drawing an enthusiastic if transient following among liberals and college students died on Sunday night in Washingn He was 95His death was confirmed  his daughter Diane AndersonThe United States was struggling with a recession a severe energy crisis and the protracted Iranian hostage crisis when Mr Anderson gave up a safe seat in the House of Representatives  seek the Republican presidential nomination When that try fizzled he reintroduced himself as an independent honestdealing alternative  the rancorous businessasusual politics of the major partiesFor a while he had the national spotlight a 58yearold maverick whose white hair hornrimmed glasses and clearheaded presentation gave him the air of a genial professor who was not so much above the fray as he was unwilling  play  its rulesMr Anderson refused  pander telling voters in Iowa that he favored President Jimmy Carters embargo on grain sales  the Soviet Union after it had invaded Afghanistan He called for a gasoline tax of 50 cents per gallon  when a gallon cost 115   save energyEarly on when all six of his rivals for the Republican nomination assured the Gun Owners of New Hampshire that they firmly opposed gun control legislation Mr Anderson said I dont understand whyWhen in this country we license people  drive aumobiles he added what is so wrong about proposing that we license guns  make sure that felons and mental incompetents dont get ahold of themHe was roundly booedHis backers promoted his campaign style as the Anderson difference but despite it  or perhaps because of it  he never finished better than second in a Republican primary That came in Illinois his home state which he had expected  win When he did not losing  Ronald Reagan  fewer than 12 points Mr Reagan was born in Illinois he decided  run as an independentDrawing support from moderate  liberal Republicans and liberal Democrats and finding a receptive audience on college campuses Mr Anderson did well in the polls at the start At one point upward of onefifth of voters said they preferred him  the major party nominees Mr Reagan and Mr Carter the Democrat who was seeking reelection Mr Anderson peaked in June when he was the choice of 24 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll 25 percent in a HarrisABC poll and 18 percent in a New York TimesCBS News pollHis hopes were sustained  the volatility of the 1980 campaign with its sudden swings of popularity Mr Carters Democratic challenger Senar Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts led  large margins in early polls only  see the president recover and defeat him soundly in the primariesMr Reagan the early Republican favorite spent money lavishly but lost  George Bush in the Iowa caucuses and trailed in national polls before a solid win in New Hampshire put him back on the road  the nomination Mr Anderson said he believed that the tide might turn in his favor in the climactic phase of the campaignSo he pushed on calling Mr Carter a mean and evasive campaigner who used a recession and high unemployment  fight inflation and criticizing Mr Reagans campaign oneliners calling them slick and simplisticBut in a pattern familiar  independent candidates Mr Andersons support drifted as voters turned  candidates who they believed could actually win the White House On Election Day when Mr Reagan won in a landslide Mr Anderson ended up with 66 percent of the popular voteMr Anderson was perceived as the most liberal of the three contenders That label probably fit on social issues like abortion but his economic views were traditionally conservative He preferred  think of himself as the moderate in the race  a selfdescription that reflected a marked political evolutionIn his first three years in the House starting in 1961 Mr Anderson a former prosecur and a decorated World War II veteran received a zero rating from the liberal group Americans for Democratic Action Not long after entering the Capil he proposed a constitutional amendment declaring that this nation devoutly recognizes the authority and law of Jesus Christ Savior and Ruler of nationsThe measure never came  a vote and he later apologized for itThough his views began  moderate he was still conservative enough in 1969 for the Republicans  elect him chairman of the House Republican Conference the thirdranking leadership position He held the post through 1979 though not without fighting off challenges from the right By then the ADA had put his voting record in the mid40s and he had harshly criticized President Richard M Nixon a fellow Republican over his handling of the Watergate scandal His own critics called Mr Anderson selfrighteous and preachyBut he grew increasingly impatient not only with the House but also with the growing strength of the right wing of his own partyExtremist fringe elements he complained in 1977 seek  expel the rest of us from the GOP He warned If the purists stage their ideological coup dtat our party will be consigned  the hisrical junk heapThe right returned the compliment with a strong Republican primary campaign against him in his 1978 House race With the help of Democratic crossover votes Mr Anderson won with 58 percent over the insurgent Don Lyon a conservative minister But he resented the challenge and his thoughts turned  the White HouseIt was always a longshot campaign Few elected officials endorsed him His Republican campaign announced in June 1979 drew little support as Mr Bush emerged as the only viable alternative  Mr Reagan who wound up choosing Mr Bush as his running mateFor his independent run announced in April 1980 Mr Anderson had  spend millions  get on the ballot in all 50 states as the National Unity Party candidate leaving little cash for television advertising His running mate was Patrick J Lucey a former Democratic governor of Wisconsin And when Mr Carter refused  join him in a September debate sponsored  the League of Women Voters  the president it was said did not want  be perceived as taking Mr Andersons candidacy seriously  Mr Andersons last and best chance of making an impact was snuffed outThe debate went ahead without the president but Mr Reagan gained more from it than Mr Anderson did When Mr Andersons poll standing slipped below 15 percent the league did not invite him back for an Ocber debate the only one between Mr Carter and Mr Reagan for whom it was a turning pointBut Mr Anderson never considered dropping outWe had operated from the very beginning with the assumption that it was a given that Jimmy Carter could not be reelected Mr Anderson ld a conference at the Institute of Politics at Harvard weeks after the election His hope he added was that with the collapse of the Carter campaign he could emerge as a rational and reasonable alternative  Ronald ReaganTo the frequent accusation that he had been a spoiler in the race he replied Whats  spoil Spoil the chances of two men at least half the country doesnt wantJohn Bayard Anderson was born on Feb 15 1922 in Rockford Ill a son of Swedish immigrants E Albin Anderson and the former Mabel Edna Ring As a boy he worked in the familys grocery sre and was the valedicrian of his class at Rockford Central High SchoolHe earned bachelors and law degrees at the University of Illinois and a master of laws at Harvard In World War II he earned four battle stars as a staff sergeant in the field artillery in Europe and later worked in the Foreign Service in Berlin and Washingn where he met Keke Machakos a passport phographer They married in 1953 Returning  Illinois he was elected states atrney for Winnebago County in 1956In addition  his daughter Diane he is survived  his wife three other daughters Eleanora van der Wal Karen Moree and Susan Anderson a son John Jr and 11 grandchildrenMr Anderson had homes in Rockford as well as in Washingn where he practiced intellectual property law and in Fort Lauderdale Fla where he taught law for many years at Nova Southeastern University He served as president of the World Federalist Association which promotes international cooperation and chairman of FairVote a nonprofit group that favors rankedchoice votingMr Anderson was the author of Between Two Worlds A Congressmans Choice 1970 The American Economy We Need 1984 and A Proper Institution Guaranteeing Televised Presidential Debates 1988The most enduring impact of his 1980 independent campaign came in the courts where his vicries enabled later thirdparty candidates like H Ross Perot and Mr Nader  get on the ballot Most important was a ruling  the United States Supreme Court in 1983 that threw out Ohios filing deadline of March 20 for independent candidates Mr Anderson had not decided  run as an independent that early in 1980 but got on the ballot when a Federal District Court ordered Ohio  let him runOhio defended its deadline as a way  maintain political stability But the Supreme Court accepted Mr Andersons argument that states could not impose substantially more onerous burdens on independent candidates than on major party nomineesThough Mr Andersons candidacy had little impact on the outcome of the 1980 election his campaign was memorable for its candor Appearing in Des Moines with six rivals for the Republican nomination Mr Anderson was alone among them in saying something specific when asked if there was anything in his career he would take back if he couldIt would have been the vote that I cast in favor of the Gulf of Tonkin resolution he said referring  the 1964 congressional measure that gave President Lyndon B Johnson license  widen the war against North VietnamHe was equally forthright in defending his call for an emergency excise tax on gasoline unpopular though it might have beenI did it as a security measure  be sure he ld the September 1980 debate audience because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have  send American boys  fight in the Persian GulfCollapse,business
How do Republicans hold on  the voters Donald Trump brought  the partySecuring the loyalty of the millions of white workingclass Americans who lined up behind Trump will require that all three wings of the Republican Party  its business faction its ideological purists and its cultural traditionalists  abandon any idea of strict adherence  core conservative principles on fiscal and social policyTrade and immigration are in my view unambiguously good for the country  but new policies on these issues will have  be done in ways that are supported  the American people not shoved down their throats  the elites In this regard I am a populist The elites in both parties have not undersod Trumpism and have often been contemptuous of the intellect and lifestyle of the Trump loyalistsMoore is not aloneThese voters have shunned Republicans because they disagree with the partys focus on low taxes small government and probusiness policies They benefit enormously from middleclass entitlement programs their children get what they consider  be good educations from public schools and state universities They have no problem with redistribution so long as it is focused on either people who cant work or people who doIn other words these voters have little or no interest in the antigovernment stance that had become reflexive among many congressional RepublicansAccommodation now requires fiscal business and social conservatives  compromise their beliefs in ways that will be wrenching if not inlerable  some Olsens assessmentThese voters view questions of public taxation and spending differently than do other factions in the party Where movement conservatives see many social programs and the high taxes that fund them as threats  liberty these voters see them as giving decent hardworking people a hand up  live decent dignified lives Where business conservatives see free trade or immigration as helping people and increasing growth these voters see those policies as favoring foreigners over themselves and as just another way that their bosses try  pay them less without justificationIn the case of cultural litmus test issues Olsen argues newly recruited white workingclass converts  Trumps Republican Party do not consider conservative dogma on gay rights abortion gender identity or traditional marriage their priorityIts everything related  jobs The conservatives are going  go crazy Im the guy pushing a trilliondollar infrastructure plan With negative interest rates throughout the world its the greatest opportunity  rebuild everything Shipyards ironworks get them all jacked up Were just going  throw it up against the wall and see if it sticks It will be as exciting as the 1930s greater than the Reagan revolution  conservatives plus populists in an economic nationalist movementBannon is explicit in his identification of the enemyThe globalists gutted the American working class and created a middle class in Asia The issue now is about Americans looking  not get fed over If we deliver well get 60 percent of the white vote and 40 percent of the black and Hispanic vote and well govern for 50 yearsTrump provided the voiceover which was taken from a speech he gave in West Palm Beach in OcberFor those who control the levers of power in Washingn and for the global special interests they partner with these people that dont have your good in mind The political establishment that is trying  sp us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dryThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our facries and our jobs as they flee  Mexico China and other countries all around the world Its a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class stripped our country of its wealth and put that money in the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities The only thing that can sp this corrupt machine is you The only force strong enough  save our country is usThey once believed they were elected  advance a narrowly ideological agenda but Trumps success has given them reason  question that beliefAmong these archconservatives who in the past had been fanatical in their pursuit of ideological purity the realization that they can no longer depend on unfailing support from their constituents has provoked deep anxietyAs Alberta put itEven if they support Trump nine times of ten voting against him once could trigger a tweetsrm or the threat of a visit  their district Its a chilling thought for members who know that the Republican National Committee the National Republican Congressional Committee and the House GOP leadership already want them goneKevin McCarthy the House majority leader plans  make full use of Trumps leverage  keep recalcitrant members of the Freedom Caucus in lineMcCarthy pointed out that Trump probably did the best in the districts of caucus members andit would be hard for them  stand up if PresidentElect Trump is asking for this fundamental change and theyre saying no  itThe incendiary nature of identity issues has prompted the two leading candidates for the chairmanship of the Democratic National Committee Tom Perez and Keith Ellison  purposefully focus on anodyne concernsOur universal message of access  economic opportunity resonates with the ironworker in northeastern Ohio and the immigrant in South Florida Perez ld the Huffingn Post referring  two states Clinn lost We sometimes have a relationship deficit with our voters because were not communicating that messageAt this point the Democratic Party must be the party that delivers for working people We can do that  meeting folks where they are looking them in the eye treating them with respect and working  solve their problemsInstead of spending the final weeks of the campaign advancing a compelling economic message  show Clinn would bring change the campaign closed with a promise  fight for opportunity and  unite a multicultural America under the banner of being stronger getherWhats happening and this is ironic is that a movement with the goal of saving black lives at this point is getting black lives taken because 80 percent of our murder victims here in Chicago are male blacksMcCarthy also pointed out that less than half of 1 percent of all the shootings in this city involve police officers shooting civiliansNor did McCarthy sp there He contended thatthe Trump election quite frankly is a reaction  that I think the people are tired of career politicians whove never really had a job telling us how we should think and how we should actIn late November such liberal icons as Bernie Sanders and President Obama cautiously broached the subject of identity politics On Nov 20 Sanders ld a group in BosnIts not good enough for someone  say Im a woman Vote for me No thats not good enough What we need is a woman who has the guts  stand up  Wall Street  the insurance companies  the drug companies  the fossil fuel industryThat same day Obama addressed reporters traveling with him in Lima PeruOne message I do have for Democrats is that a strategy thats just microtargeting particular discrete groups in a Democratic coalition sometimes will win you elections but its not going  win you the broad mandate that you needwe try  slice the elecrate up And we try  say Youre black youre brown youre gay youre straight youre a woman youre a man The reality of it is theres no juice in that kind of campaignThis thing where an obscure male backbencher thinks he deserves  replace the most accomplished woman in Congress is how sexism worksIf I see my party not considering even more intensely than theyve done in the past the economic social and political climate of the people I represent the people Ive been fighting for all my life then Im going  raise hellAt the moment the Democratic Party is structurally fragile and its members have shied away from the kind of radical upheaval Republicans have been forced  embrace Nonetheless Democrats will soon face enormously risky decisionsOr should the party edge

The Trump appointee charged with enforcing federal labor rights is moving  head off a court ruling in a case against McDonalds that could redefine the accountability of companies for their franchisees employment practicesThe case being tried before a special court of the National Labor Relations Board was brought during the Obama administration when the board was under Democratic control Since President Trumps election Republican members have regained a majority steering the board away from a prolabor orientationAn adverse decision for McDonalds could have enormous implications for the franchise business model affecting millions of workers in the fastfood industry and beyond Employees at disparate franchise locations could seek union representation  deal directly with parent companies rather than be left  work out disputes with franchiseesBut rather than push for a decision that could create a broad precedent the boards new general counsel has been scrambling  broker settlement terms among the company its franchisees and the workers at the center of the case A judge had halted the trial for 60 days  provide a chance  do soOn Monday when a proposed settlement was presented the judge said not so fastThe proposal would pay a range of roughly 20  50000  several dozen workers who alleged that McDonalds franchises had violated their labor rights The agreement would include no admission of liability  McDonalds or its franchiseesMcDonalds argued in a motion that the terms were far more substantial than anything the government was likely  win in court It noted that the settlement would save years of litigation during which time workers would receive no monetary reliefMicah Wissinger a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union and affiliated groups which helped bring the charges against McDonalds and has been an advocate for the workers called the proposal a shamIn a real settlement McDonalds would take responsibility for illegally firing and harassing workers fighting  get off food stamps and out of poverty Mr Wissinger said in a statement after Mondays court appearanceThe judge Lauren Esposi ld the lawyers that she would schedule a hearing on the proposed settlement so they could air their arguments and said the agreement would not be valid without her approvalNonetheless some workers have already received portions of the specified payments according  email correspondence between an official of the National Labor Relations Board and a union lawyerThe board did not respond  a request for commentA central question in the trial is whether McDonalds is a socalled joint employer of workers directly employed  its franchisees A parent company is considered a joint employer if it controls their working conditions although the legal criteria for determining control in this context has shifted in recent yearsA finding that McDonalds is a joint employer would make the company liable for laborlaw violations committed  its franchisees and would require it  bargain with restaurant workers who unionizedThe workers in the case asserted that their bosses at McDonalds restaurants had disciplined them retaliated against them and in some cases fired them for taking part in protests beginning in 2012 in which they demanded a 15 hourly wage and a unionBut in January the labor boards new general counsel appointed  Mr Trump was granted a 60day stay in the case  which expired Monday   pursue settlement talksThe general counsel Peter B Robb argued that two labor board decisions in December one of which changed the legal standard for determining joint employment might have weakened aspects of the case against McDonalds and made a settlement more likelyIn his request for a stay Mr Robb said a settlement could facilitate far more prompt and immediate remedial relief for the employees impacted  the alleged unfair labor practicesBefore the December decision  the board a parent company like McDonalds could be considered a joint employer if it exerted indirect control over workers at a franchisee or if it had the right  exercise control over workers that it nonetheless did not exerciseAfter the boards decision in December a company had  have direct and immediate control over workers  be considered a joint employerAt the time he sought a stay labor groups argued that Mr Robbs logic was specious because the boards case against McDonalds did not hinge on which definition of joint employment appliedLawyers for the Service Employees International Union argued that even if the general counsel preferred  seek a settlement it made no sense  sp the trial which was only days from concluding in order  do soIn a court filing they argued that spping the trial would give McDonalds an advantage  preventing union lawyers from crossexamining a key witness and that it fostered a game of hidetheballSeveral Democratic senars including Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey stated in a March 7 letter that the boards reversal eliminates whatever support may have existed for your efforts  settle the McDonalds case so near  the trials close They urged Mr Robb  swiftly resume and finish the trialBut Mr Robbs office pressed ahead with its efforts  reach a settlement Last week lawyers from the labor boards regional offices abruptly reached out  several former McDonalds workers involved in the case In one instance a labor board lawyer called a worker and asked if she was ok with 50k for back pay as part of the settlement according  an email between the board and Mr Wissinger one of the union lawyers The offer was conditional on the workers waiving her right  be reinstated in her old jobMr Wissinger said that the calls created the impression that workers needed  accept the offers before they consulted with him or his colleagues or anyone else and that at least two didIt was a done deal  the time we found out Mr Wissinger said They were completely cutting us out of the processJennifer Abruzzo who served as deputy general counsel of the labor board until 2017 said settlement discussions that excluded lawyers who backed the workers were a break with cusmThats unusual Ms Abruzzo said The charging party is the one that the regions typically go  And the charging party in this instance is the SEIUCollapse,business

Common SenseTesting the upper limits of valuation Snaps invesrs are betting on the kind of rapid growth that few if any companies have ever achievedSupported By now even most of us over 35  old age  Snapchat standards  are aware of the pho sharing and messaging app sweeping teenage and millennial AmericaEven if you have no interest in sending nude phos of yourself that selfdestruct or in video lenses that enable you  vomit a rainbow turn your head in a taco or make your eyes in glittering hearts you may be wondering how such groundbreaking technology could be worth 34 billionAt that price Snap makes its much bigger rival Facebook  not  mention such internet stalwarts as ogle Amazon and even Netflix  look like bargainbasement value scksSnap looks tremendously overvalued  me said Brian Hamiln a cofounder of Sageworks a financial analysis and valuation firmMichael Nathanson senior research analyst at MoffettNathanson described Snap as a field of dreams Even with rosy growth forecasts at 22 billion were looking at a sck trading at five  eight times estimated revenues in 2020 he said before the valuation rose even higher The only companies in that domain are Facebook and Alibaba and they have massive scale And both of them are profitableMajor IPOs of Internet technology company since AOL in 1992So lets be generous and ignore profit How about revenue Snap said it generated 404 million in sales in 2016 A valuation of 34 billion is about 84 times revenueThats six times as high as Facebooks pricesales ratio which is 14 Its 14 times as high as ogles parent Alphabet which trades at just over six times revenue Amazon trades at a mere three times Even highflying Netflix trades at seven timesCompared with Snap however those are mature companies whose growth rates have slowed somewhat as theyve aged As Mr Nathanson and his fellow research analyst Perry ld put it in a recent note  clients There is something brilliant about going public after only a few years of generating any revenue at all The skys the limit and hisry is not a guideTo justify a valuation of even 25 billion you have  make some very lofty assumptions Mr Hamiln said They would need  grow for the next 10 years at more than 50 percent every year with a profit margin of 25 percent which is extremely high given that they are now losing money rapidly He noted that very few companies had achieved such growth rates in the hisry of American businessBut lets ignore revenue o This is social media after all where daily active users and engagement are the coins of the realmAnd 1 billion now looks like a bargain compared  what invesrs are paying for Snap At 34 billion each of Snaps daily active users is worth 215 six and a half times per user what Facebook paid for InstagramAs of January Instagram reported 300 million daily active users At 215 each the Instagram app alone would be valued day at 645 billionThese are static numbers and what Snap is selling invesrs is growth According  Snaps prospectus Snapchat user growth was 48 percent in 2016 about the same as the year before If it can pull that off again next year it would reach an impressive 234 million users though still short of InstagramThe Snapchat sry is all about growth Mr Nathanson said Its not about economicsBut Snapchats growth slowed sharply in last years fourth quarter  just about the time Instagram started its own version of Sries a popular Snapchat feature where users post a sequence of phos or videos It added just five million new users after adding an average of 15 million in the first three quartersBy comparison 150 million Instagram users are now using its Sries feature Thats already nearly as many as Snapchats entire user baseMaybe Snap can squeeze more revenue per user even if its user base doesnt grow all that much Its currently generating an average of 583 a year per user in the United States compared with Facebooks North American average of 1281 the MoffettNathanson analysis notes suggesting plenty of room  growBut even doubling revenue doesnt get Snap close  a Facebook valuationThere are of course superhigh revenue and usergrowth assumptions that put Snap in the ballpark of successful and more established social media companies in valuationStill very few analysts have publicly said they believe Snap is undervalued at these levels and I looked for some The most bullish report I came across estimated that Snap could be worth as much as 30 billion But thats based on an extremely aggressive revenue estimate of 38 billion in 2018Mr ld said some invesrs were buying in the IPO but not  hold Snap for the long term People are saying theyll wait for a valuation thats truly astronomical and then take the other side of the bet he said They feel Snap will be richly valued out of the gate but possibly run in trouble over the next few quartersDespite many of its somewhat juvenile features at a more profound level Snapchat is changing the way young people communicate substituting images for language Snapchat has built a better mousetrap Mr Nathanson said Its engaging and its fun especially for young peopleThats a sry that obviously appealed  invesrs starving for the next hot social media company Whether theyll want  cash in quickly or hold their shares for the long term remains  be seenThis looks and smells like Twitter  me Mr Hamiln said Im concerned that invesrs will have  wait a very long time if ever before they see any meaningful appreciationAbout the best Mr Nathanson and Mr ld could come up with Snaps valuation isnt patently crazyCollapse,business
Common SenseCan this tax plan be savedPredictably Democrats their allies and many independent economists pounced on the plan as a tax cut for the rich Deficit hawks including many Republicans denounced it as recklessly driving up the federal deficit And legislars from hightax states including Republicans howled at the proposal  end the deduction for state and local taxesNot surprisingly for the most part President Trump has taken the approach of publicizing the benefits of his plan  mostly corporate and business tax cuts  while leaving the hard part closing loopholes  Congress As Steven M Rosenthal a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center a nonpartisan think tank put it Tax cuts are easy Tax reform is hardBut this plan is just an opening salvo I was surprised this week in interviews with tax experts from across the political spectrum  hear that all those issues can be resolved if Congress is willing  take up the challengeCritics of the plan have mostly ignored that substantial elements of it have drawn bipartisan support Almost everyone agrees that corporate tax rates need  be cut because of global competition Companies should not be able  stash earnings overseas taxfree With the standard deduction doubled many more individual taxpayers could file a simple shortform return A lower rate for small businesses and passthrough entities while more controversial should promote economic growthThe most important things for the middle class will be better economic performance and growth in wages said Douglas HoltzEakin president of the American Action Forum a conservative progrowth advocacy group Thats a much more powerful force than any tax policy From that perspective this is a promising start But its only a startRepresentative Kevin Brady Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee ld me this week that he was determined  get a tax bill  the president  the end of the yearIs that ambitious asked Mr Brady Absolutely President Reagans reform ok two and a half years Were trying  do it in one year But the economy and the public are desperately in need of tax reform he added and we are continuing  work on the final design of the tax reform plan that well have ready after the budget is completeLowering the passthrough rate  25 percent the analysis shows would add another 770 billion  the deficitAnd the White House has also proposed repealing the estate tax The price tag for that change would be about 240 billionClosing various corporate loopholes would add back about 400 billion the Tax Policy Center estimated That leaves a net cost of about 26 trillion over the 10year periodThe Trump administration has insisted that it is adamant about eliminating the state and local tax deduction a move that would generate 13 trillion over those 10 years and providing for immediate expensing of capital expenditures which would cost about 220 billion over five years but Republicans in Congress are already balking So Im ignoring those elementsThe Republican budget resolution accepts a 10year revenue shortfall of 15 trillion on the theory that faster economic growth will make up the difference Thats a debatable proposition but for purposes of this discussion lets accept itAll of that leaves a 10year gap of about 11 trillion between the Tax Policy Centers projected net cost and the deficit built in the budget resolutionSo where should the money come from Here are three proposals that could draw bipartisan supportThe White House plan explicitly leaves open the possibility of a new higher bracket for the rich Depending on how high the marginal tax rate is it could simultaneously raise substantial revenue and help minimize the claim that the plan is tilted ward the wealthyThis seems reasonable given that the rich benefit disproportionately from cuts  corporate tax rates since they are overwhelmingly the owners of the companies that would get a windfall from the cuts They have already seen the value of their scks riseThe current p marginal income tax rate is 396 percentNeither the Tax Policy Center nor the Tax Foundation has analyzed the impact of a new p bracket so I have done some rough calculationsA p bracket of 44 percent for the p 01 percent of taxpayers  those with adjusted gross incomes of more than 21 million in 2014  would generate about 300 billion over 10 yearsThere are only about 140000 of these extremely high earners but they already put in about 20 percent of the revenue that comes from the federal individual income taxIf Congress wants  take the new bracket down  the p 1 percent  those with adjusted gross incomes of more than 466000 in 2014  doing so would generate about 600 billion in additional revenue The p 1 percent provide about 40 percent of federal income tax revenueThe large and vocal nonprofit secr would probably cheer a higher tax bracket for the ultrarich because it would make the tax benefits of their charitable deductions more valuable The wealthy already account for a disproportionate share of charitable giving the p 1 percent accounted for 37 percent of deductions for charitable contributions in 2014But raising rates for the highest earners would raise issues of fairness since it would further penalize earned income while leaving passive income like capital gains unuched A higher tax bracket for the highest earners would have little impact on Mr Trump since he has relatively little earned income as opposed  passthrough income and capital gainsStill  help pay for progrowth corporate tax cuts I would have no problem raising capitalgains rates or creating a new bracket for the rich or both Mr HoltzEakin saidThe appreciation of capital assets is already taxed at an extremely favorable rate compared  labor Thats why the rich pay such a low effective tax rate no matter what their marginal tax bracket Various justifications for lower capitalgains rates have been proffered over the years none of them selfevident But even conceding the wisdom of lower capitalgains rates why should they never be taxed at all even as they are passed from generation  generationThe argument for taxing such gains seems even more compelling given the proposed elimination of the estate tax which at least captures some capital gains among the wealthiest peopleTo take away the backsp of the estate tax without a tax on capital gains at death is crazy Mr Rosenthal saidDuring the campaign Mr Trump proposed a plan  tax capital gains in excess of 10 million at death That would avoid shifting the burden from the very wealthy  the less affluent Congress could even exempt familyowned farms and small businesses There arent that many valued at more than 10 millionThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that the exclusion of capital gains at death would cost the Treasury 644 billion from 2014  2023 How much of that could be recaptured depends on where the threshold is set it certainly could be lower or even higher than the 10 million Lets assume about half or 320 billionThe White House plan is silent on the issue In this instance Id say Let Trump be Trump Mr Rosenthal saidBoth approaches would raise substantial revenue although its hard  calculate just how much The Tax Foundation estimates that the corporate interest deduction would cost the Treasury 12 trillion over 10 years A rough estimate for what could be saved would be 600 billionOf course nothing about tax reform is easy Real estate invesrs Mr Trump among them love the interest deduction So do banks and other lendersThe White House plan is silent on the issueThe botm line Potential revenue from the three suggestions above adds up  122 trillion Extending the p bracket  the upper 1 percent would raise another 300

But Trump according  Tulis is unique in that no other previous major party presidential candidate has felt so unconstrained  these constitutional normsConstraints that would have prevented the

Common SenseIts hard  imagine a tax code more favorable  real estate developers than the one we already haveDonald Trump has come up with oneBut Mr Trumps new tax proposal doesnt just preserve those breaks it piles on new ones for real estate developers like Mr Trump himself  at an estimated cost of more than 1 trillion in tax revenue over a decadeMoreover this doesnt count Mr Trumps more general tax cuts which deliver the biggest windfalls  the highest earners Many real estate developers would reap further gains from those provisions if they became lawEven conservative Republican tax experts have denounced the specific real estate measures Mr Trump has outlinedLets start with carried interest a muchcriticized tax loophole that allows private equity operars hedge fund managers and real estate partners  convert ordinary income in capital gains which are taxed at a lower rateWealthy hedge fund managers and private equity partners like the former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney have attracted much of the criticism for exploiting the loophole but the concept originated with real estate developers long before hedge funds were commonplaceInstead of taking a fee for their management services which would be taxed as ordinary income people who earn carried interest take a percentage of assets under management and a percentage of the eventual profits a formula often described as two and twenty The percentage of profits is taxed at the lower capital gains rateIn what at first might seem a laudable effort  put the public interest ahead of his own financial gain Mr Trump called for abolishing the loophole We will eliminate the carried interest deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street invesrs and people like me but unfair  American workers Mr Trump said in Detroit on Aug 7But his fellow real estate invesrs and the Wall Street interests he lambastes neednt worry Hes offering them an even better tax break that renders carried interest irrelevantMr Trump has proposed a new rate  15 percent on all corporate and business income  that is lower than the current capital gains rate of 20 percent on profits from the sale of assets which is already well below the p tax rate on ordinary income of around 40 percent The new lower rate would apply  passthrough entities according  Mr Trumps plan Tax Reform That Will Make America Great AgainWhile they can be found in all secrs of the economy including private equity and hedge funds they are especially prevalent in real estate Mr Trump identified 564 separate business entities in his financial disclosure forms most of them LLCs and partnershipsThat amounts  a huge tax cut even for people who had been paying taxes on carried interest at the preferential rate since most carried interest is generated  a business entity said Alan Cole an economist at the Tax Foundations Center for Federal Tax Policy The center warned last year before Mr Trumps latest revisions that his overall plan could cost over 10 trillion in reduced tax revenues over 10 years depending on how it is calculatedThe rich who already benefit from carried interest will get a big tax cut Mr HoltzEakin agreedThe UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center estimated that lowering the rate on business income from passthrough entities  15 percent would cost 1 trillion over 10 yearsMr Trump already benefits from enormous depreciation benefits which allow active real estate developers like him  use paper losses  offset other earned income Mr Trumps proposals go even further allowing for immediate writeoffs rather than spreading them over several yearsWe will allow businesses  immediately expense new business investments he said in DetroitThe idea of immediately expensing capital investments rather than writing them off over time has many supporters among tax experts including the Tax Foundation and Mr HoltzEakin Among other things it simplifies the calculations and in theory would promote capital spending at a time its been laggingBut few if any support expensing capital investments while also allowing an interest expense deductionThats because the combined deductions provide a reason  borrow even when it doesnt make economic sense As a simple example consider a landlords 1000 investment in a new garage door for a rental property Someone who borrows 900 at 5 percent would spend just 100 out of pocket but could deduct 900 plus interest or 945 generating a large tax loss Even assuming Mr Trumps favorable business tax rate of 15 percent goes in effect the tax benefit 142 is greater than the cash spent creating a purely tax incentiveHeres what the 2005 Presidents Advisory Panel for Federal Tax Reform under President George W Bush concluded Allowing both expensing of new investments and an interest deduction would result in a net tax subsidy  new investment the report found Projects that would not be economical in a notax world might become viable just because of the tax subsidy This would result in economic disrtions and adversely impact economic activityEvery other proposal  expense business investments including the House Republican plan limits interest deductionsEliminating the interest deduction will generate an enormous amount of kvetching out of highly leveraged invesrs real estate developers among them said Mr HoltzEakin I have no sympathy for that If your business model depends on interest deductibility thats not a business its a tax shelterMr Trump hasnt explicitly addressed whether interest payments should remain deductible as they are now but various advisers have said he supports maintaining the deduction The Trump campaign didnt respond  my requests for commentTrump is a debt king said Mr Rosenthal Hes made a living from deducting interest Hes never going  give that upThe changes and inconsistencies in Mr Trumps tax reform proposals have left many experts scratching their heads Trump has no overarching principle that I can identify said Mr HoltzEakin I want a tax code  express values It should be about somethingThat leaves it open  speculation that Mr Trumps plan is mostly about himself and other wealthy real estate developers Its hard  tell for sure since he hasnt released his tax returnsIf as Ive suggested he pays little or no tax because he can use the existing tax code  reduce his taxable income  near zero or even a loss his proposals that extend even more breaks  developers might have relatively little impact on his own tax obligationsStill  the degree they would reduce his tax rate  15 percent and accelerate depreciation while maintaining the interest deduction they would ensure that Mr Trump  and most of his friends on Wall Street who would be well positioned  exploit his new loophole  would never pay anything close  the 33 percent p rate hes now proposing for his fellow AmericansCollapse,business
Mr Mariotti is a former federal prosecurMr Trumps team plans  use the questions  attack the special counsel as overreaching and going beyond his mandate but the questions themselves suggest that Mr Mueller has carefully stayed within his bounds They contain nothing about obscure business deals or real estate transactions the questions focus on coordination with Russia obstruction of justice and pics that have been covered at length in the news media None of the pics should have come as a surprise  Mr Trumps team aside from an explosive question about efforts  the former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort  seek aid from the Kremlin which is squarely about coordination with RussiaWhat should concern Mr Trumps team is how the questions zero in on Mr Trumps criminal liability They leave little doubt that Mr Trump is in serious jeopardy particularly regarding obstruction of justice I concluded months ago that Mr Mueller would likely determine that the president obstructed justice but the questions show that Mr Mueller has already thought about how he would prove his case The queries ask about Mr Trumps state of mind when he fired James Comey when he erupted in anger at Atrney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself and when he considered firing the special counsel The questions are intended  prove the case against Mr Trump through his own wordsBut it would be a mistake  count the number of questions focused on obstruction and conclude that Mr Muellers investigation of the president focuses primarily on that pic The inquiries on pics other than obstruction are broad For example the question What discussions did you have during the campaign regarding any meeting with Mr Putin encompasses a lot of ground You could ask a similar broad question regarding the Comey firing  What discussions did you have about or with James Comey  and cover much of the ground covered in the 18 questions related  himThe fact that the questions on pics other than obstruction are so broad does not necessarily suggest that Mr Mueller has less evidence regarding those pics A more likely possibility is that Mr Mueller is not willing  tip his hand on those pics because the evidence he has regarding them hasnt been extensively covered in the pressAgain its worth remembering that Mr Trumps team not Mr Mueller reportedly devised these questions Mr Mueller may have merely responded  specific inquiries from the Trump team and they might have asked about fewer specific events related  other picsIf Mr Trump does not agree  an interview Mr Mueller is reportedly considering subpoenaing him  testify before a grand jury The presidents lawyers are considering whether  challenge Mr Muellers authority  subpoena Mr Trump for an investigation of potential crimes he committed while in office No president has ever challenged a prosecurs right  subpoena him  testify in court Although Bill Clinn received a grand jury subpoena for his testimony it was withdrawn after he agreed  an interviewMr Trumps claim would be novel but the Supreme Court denied Richard Nixons challenge  a subpoena for documents and tapes as well as Mr Clinns request  postpone a civil lawsuit during his presidency The Supreme Court would likely rule against Mr Trump but he could use the challenge  delay Mr Muellers investigation and his own testimony which explains why Mr Mueller is trying  negotiate a voluntary interviewWhat is hardest  know is why Mr Mueller is seeking an interview of Mr Trump at what appears  be an early stage of the investigation Typically prosecurs wait until the end of an investigation  interview their most important witness because they uncover additional evidence as the investigation progresses So does this mean that Mr Muellers investigation is wrapping up soon Or does it mean that he is considering splitting his investigation in phases with a report at the end of each phase Im skeptical that hell do that What if he uncovers new evidence in Phase 2 that changes his view of something he investigated in Phase 1The simplest explanation for the early interview is that Mr Mueller thinks his chances of getting the president  agree  an interview will decrease over time Mr Trump could at some point decide  take the Fifth  avoid testimony despite any political downsideThe potential questions we saw this week explain why Mr Trump is so concerned about his criminal liability He faces difficult questions  not just about obstruction but also about a host of pics related  coordination with Russia  and his lawyers appear convinced that he cannot answer them without putting himself in further jeopardyRena Mariotti is a former federal prosecurCollapse,business

revelations  New Hampshire Democrats were solidly in Hillary Clinns camp The WBUR survey found that 86 percent of Democrats said they would vote for Clinn while 4 percent would vote for Trump 8 percent said they would vote for a thirdparty candidate and one percent said they were undecidedEven more troubling for local Republican candidates is the finding that independent voters favor Clinn over Trump  better than two  one 4923A higher than average share of New Hampshire voters do not align with either party  pollsters estimate that 15  17 percent fall in this category  and they play a crucial role in determining the outcome of general electionsDemocrats for their part are doing everything they can  turn Trump in a Republican albatrossNew Hampshire once one of the most reliably Republican states in the nation began  shift in a Democratic direction in 1992 From 1992  2012 Democratic presidential candidates carried the state in every election except 2000 Democratic candidates have also won nine of the last 10 gubernarial elections which take place every two yearsNew Hampshire reflects many of the difficulties facing the Trump campaignAnd if you look at New York you look at Indiana you look at Pennsylvania you look at all of them  they all have one thing in common No matter where you go its like 40 percent its like 50 percent 60 percent jobs are goneSecond Trumps Manchester rally itself raises a basic question Why was the Republican presidential nominee spending valuable time in New Hampshire a state with a paltry four Elecral College votes His trip here last

Trump is forcing us  play defense in a state we wouldnt play in anyway He is not pushing in our map States like New Hampshire he cant afford  lose while we have opportunity states like Virginia Arizona and North Carolina Real opportunities  expand the mapAnother facr in Trumps decision  invest a chunk of time in New Hampshire last week is that he has no strong surrogates here  build momentum With prominent Republicans shunning him he has  do his own heavy liftingVoters I talked  in downwn Concord expressed a strong distaste for both candidates but generally tilted ward Clinn when pressedA policewoman ticketing cars on North Main Street initially said she did not like either candidate  Im thankful Im wearing this uniform so I dont have  answer you But as the conversation progressed she acknowledged that she was almost certain  vote for Clinn She wants  help families jobs the middle class There really is no other choice As for Trump I dont believe a word that comes out of his mouthJeffery Wells 51 who ld me that he receives annual disability payments of roughly 22000 for COPD and back trouble captured the conflicted feelings of some Clinn supportersLike her no But vote for her yes Shes much more experienced shes been everywhere she has done a lot for families and childrenBill and Christine White are independent voters who moved  New Hampshire from Massachusetts 15 years ago after they retired Ms White who recalled her support for George Mcvern in 1972 said Trump is the worst candidate I can remember in my life Her husband believes that Hillary is just saying everything people want  hear Both Whites plan  vote for a thirdparty candidate so that as Bill White said they can feel morally rightThere are orthodox Republicans who do plan  support TrumpThey argued that Trump would be more reasonable in the White House than he has been on the campaign trail and that his experience in business would make him a good chief executiveHes not crazy You dont get where he is  being crazy said David P Currier a former state senar who now is running the Henniker Brewing Company He says a lot of things for effect  hes a New YorkerBob Nash a state lobist for an insurance agents association said that he is confident that Trump once in the White House would be constrained  the American system of governmentI am a firm believer in the check and balances in our system Nash said adding Trump is an intelligent man hes been a successful man all his lifeNash said he voted for Clinn in the 2008 New Hampshire primary but that as a veteran he is now firmly opposed  her bid because he believes she mismanaged the 2012 attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi I am absolutely convinced without a shadow of a doubt that she lied  those parents he saidLeigh Bosse 69 who publishes a weekly paper in Hillsborough NH said he was voting for Trump but with mixed feelingsIve put my foot in my mouth many times but he does it daily Bosse said Trump says some good things but  d  Bosse paused  show his exasperation He said he would vote for Gary Johnson if the Libertarian Party nominee had a chance of winning But as a practical matter Bosse said he will vote for Trump in large part because he finds Clinn anathema I cant believe Hillary hasnt been indictedTrumps uphill fight  win New Hampshire is likely  be made steeper  the Union Leader the dominant paper in the stateTrump has shown himself  be a crude blowhard with no clear political philosophy and no deeper understanding of the important and serious role of President of the United States than one of the goons he lets rough up protesters in his crowdsThe TrumpMcQuaid dustup illuminates some of the most important dilemmas facing the Trump campaignRothwell analyzed geographic and demographic characteristics of 87428 adults asked in Gallup Daily Tracking surveys in July if they had favorable or unfavorable views of TrumpRothwell found thatTrumps supporters are older with higher household incomes are more likely  be male white nonHispanic less likely  identify as LGBTQ less likely  hold a bachelors degree or higher education more likely  be a veteran or family member of a veteran more likely  work in a bluecollar occupation and are more likely  be Christian and report that religion is important  themIn addition racial isolation increases the likelihood of Trump supportPeople living in ZIP codes with disproportionately high shares of white residents are significantly and robustly more likely  view Trump favorablyTrumps problem in New Hampshire and elsewhere is that his pockets of strength are not substantial enough  produce majorities In the huge Gallup sample 65 percent reported unfavorable views of TrumpThe funny thing is that what would make a Trump vicry most plausible is just the kind of unAmerican activity he has been campaigning against  in this case a multiparty parliamentary system For good or ill many European elecral systems foster rather than suffocate candidates who cant win majorities but who have a shot at winning a pluralityIts not the kind of country Trump would want  live in but its the kind of country that might elect himSee

OpEd ContribursIn the aftermath of the health care blowup President Trump and the Republicans need a legislative vicry Tax reform probably should have gone first but now is the time  move it forward with urgencyUnfortunately the White House seems all over the map on the subject One day there is a trial balloon for a valueadded tax The next the idea of a carbon tax or a reciprocal tax And now we are hearing the curve ball of a payroll tax cut Steve Mnuchin the Treasury secretary has thrown cold water on the idea of any tax bill meeting the August deadlineOne sure lesson from the health care setback is the old admonition Keep it simple stupid The Republicans tried  fix the trilliondollar health insurance market instead of keeping the focus on repealing ObamacareThey have a chance  make amends with a new tax bill and still hit the August deadline We advised President Trump during his election campaign and we believe the Republican Partys lesson for tax reform is this Dont try  rewrite the entire tax code in one billInstead the primary goal of Mr Trumps first tax bill should be  fix the federal corporate and smallbusiness tax system which has made America increasingly uncompetitive in global markets and has reduced jobs and wages here at home The White House and the Treasury already have a tax plan that we were involved with last year The three most important planks of that plan areFirst cut the federal corporate and smallbusiness highest tax rate  15 percent from 35 percent which is now one of the highest corporate tax rates in the worldSecond allow businesses  immediately deduct the full cost of their capital purchases Full expensing of new facries equipment and machinery will jumpstart business investment which since 2000 has grown at only onethird the rate recorded from 1950  2000Third impose a low tax on the repatriation of foreign profits brought back  the United States This could attract more than 2 trillion  these shores raising billions for the Treasury while creating new jobs and adding  the United States gross domestic productTo help win over Democratic votes in the House and Senate we would also suggest another component What many workers across the country want most from President Trump is infrastructure funding As part of this bill we should create a fund dedicated  rebuilding Americas roads highways airports and pipelines and modernizing the electric grid and broadband access  financed through the tax money raised from repatriation of foreign profitsAs much as possible this bill should include private financing for projects like ll roads and energy drilling We also favor user pays financing such as ll roads and we would oppose any Fannie Maetype financing structure for projects that would put taxpayers on the hook for hundreds of billions in potential lossesFor this strategy  work Republicans need  take several steps First President Trump and Paul Ryan the speaker of the House should sp insisting on revenue neutrality In the short term the bill will add  the deficit But President Trumps tax bill like those of Presidents Ronald Reagan and John Kennedy should be a tax cut and it should be sold  the American people as suchWe should emphasize that business tax relief is not a sellout  corporations but a boon for middleclass workers A study  the Tax Foundation and Kevin A Hassett then at the American Enterprise Institute and now the chairman of President Trumps Council of Economic Advisers found that middleclass wages rise when business taxes fallThe additional increase in real wages could be nearly 10 percent over the next decade which would reverse 15 years of income stagnation for the working class in America And if we are right that tax cuts will spur the economy then the faster economic growth as a result of the bill will bring down the deficitNext Republicans should abandon the socalled borderadjustable tax A border tax is a poison pill for the tax plan It divides the very business groups that the party needs  rally behind tax reform Retailers like Walmart will never go along A carbon tax would be even worse The best way  bring jobs back  America is  simply lower tax rates now while rolling back antijobs regulations such as rules that inhibit American energy productionAs for fixing the maddeningly complex individual income tax system  lowering tax rates and ending needless deductions  we are all for it but that should wait until 2018 Jobs and the economy are the p priority  votersRepublicans need  act with some degree of urgency The financial markets and American businesses are starting  get jittery over the prospect that a tax cut wont get done this year A failure here would be negative for the economy and the sck market and could stall out the Trump bounce we have seen since the presidents electionMr Trump should demand that Congress send him a jobs bill this summer that he can sign in law on Aug 13 2017 That is the day President Reagan signed his hisric tax cut in 1981 at his beloved Ranch del Cielo in Santa Barbara CalifThat tax cut and President Kennedys before it unleashed two of the longest periods of prosperity in American hisry and that is a result Donald Trump should want  replicateSteve Forbes Larry Kudlow Arthur Laffer and Stephen Moore cofounders of the Committee  Unleash Prosperity advised the Trump presidential campaign on economic policyCollapse,business

How Watson and Weather ARE Helping Crops Grow StrongerThe boxes are the homes of bees the extraordinary winged creatures responsible for the flowers bright yellow blooms each summer Their owner is Richard Adee a beekeeper since 1957 A lot has changed since he began his career producing honey For one his familys income now depends mostly on pollination services that his some 80000 hives of bees provide across the country The shift has caused new challenges large and small but one has remained a constant since the very beginning the weatherYou just kind of have  go  what weather comes your way says Adee 87 who is coowner of the largest beekeeping operation in the world Adee Honey Farms headquartered in Bruce SD Most of the time you just have  wait it outHoneybees work best at specific temperatures based on the individual crops theyre pollinating and foraging be it clover almonds or sunflowers If its o hot many of the bees will have  stay behind flapping their wings  keep the hive cool If its raining or o cold the bees wont work at all As a result Adee is often at the mercy of the weather a position all o familiar for many businesses Its estimated that weather has a 500 billion annual impact on the economyThankfully day Adee has better options There is more precise weather data available  meteorologists scientists and farmers than ever before Thanks  cognitive technology that allows machines  learn from data sets as varied as a barometric reading  a satellite phograph we now have the ols  synthesize analyze and act on that information  make better decisions At the forefront of this technology is IBM Watson and following the acquisition of The Weather Company which delivers up  26 billion forecasts every day for 22 billion locations around the world weve entered a new era of weather forecasting one that is changing the face of business and our daily livesA New Era In Weather Forecastingn a recent day the forecast called for a 50 percent chance of thundersrms in the morning with a high of 86 and a low of 56 While simple enough forecasts like this have decades of hisry behind them Theyre the result of a range of models developed  meteorologists  make a best guess based on a variety of conditions atmospheric pressure temperature winds and moreA single commercial colony of bees has up  50000 beesBees in a colony have an array of jobs housekeeper drone builder nurse forager even air conditionerHisrically we spped once we provided a basic forecast We left it up  the individual  kind of decide what they did with the information says Brandon Hertell Offering Manager at IBM Analytics and AMS Certified Consulting Meteorologis Today the meteorology business is focusing more on decision support Were interested in  and analytics and cognitive technology starts  work in this  what youre going  do with that information nowRichard Adee with his familyRichard Adee with his familyThis is the difference between predictive forecasting  or a simple best guess as  what the weather will be like  and prescriptive forecasting the ability  expand on that forecast and provide concrete information on how best  react  itMuch of Adees business is in pollinating industrial crops such as almonds soy and apples around the country Instead of letting Adee know that it might rain in the location of his almond clients in California in two weeks a prescriptive forecast might provide information on which route will have favorable weather or even how many bees  transport  a specific location based on climateA single commercial colony of bees has up  50000 beesBees in a colony have an array of jobs housekeeper drone builder nurse forager even air conditionerBees can travel up  two miles  forageCrops that require bee pollination have increased 300 percent over the last 50 yearsWhere Data Comes Fromo achieve this kind of detail a more varied complex and expansive collection of data is required compared  what meteorologists have traditionally relied on Experts make the distinction between structured data that we typically find in a numerical spreadsheet or databases and unstructured data which tends  be less digestible and more difficult  integrate and compare  other forms of data In fact 80 percent of all data day is considered unstructured social media posts news articles and research reports for exampleOnly about 20 percent of the worlds data is available on the internet says David Kenny General Manager at IBM Watson The rest isnt on the internet because it doesnt naturally digitizeBees can travel up  two miles  forageCrops that require bee pollination have increased 300 percent over the last 50 yearsTo examine structured and unstructured data at the same time means collecting and managing data from thousands of weather stations cell phones satellite imagery hisrical databases newspapers tweets even the frequency of windshield wipers on WiFi enabled cars  the list goes on Its more than any one person or even a team of meteorologists could fathomI cant possibly comprehend every possible scenario or research every potential srm and outcome that happened in hisry based on what I know day on a weather forecast says Hertell Thats what Watson helps us doIn a lot of ways Watson augments the analytical abilities humans already possess It can analyze things beyond just numbers looking at unstructured data  map out the full picture and in doing so can help us make better decisions based on the weatherWatson enables us  quickly uncover a lot more data relationships and patterns in a systematic way says Peter Neilley IBM Distinguished Engineer and SVP Global Forecasting Sciences for The Weather Company What has changed is the mass of that computing and the scale which we can now apply  the problem Its only the tip of the iceberg so far Watson will help us get from addressing billions of dollars of economic impact  trillions of dollars of economic impact Thats whats new and coolToday beekeepers like the Adees rely on traditional weather forecasting Data from weather stations is plugged in a number of models that meteorologists can adjust based on specific circumstancesThe Adees and farmers alike will use this information  roughly predict where and when  put their bees  match peak bloom or what kind of behavior the bees will demonstrateIn the near future The Weather Companys existing array of data sources will be complemented  unstructured data providing a bigger picture of the weatherWith the help of human experts Watson will be trained in how  analyze and synthesize this vast and varied array of data  provide actionable advice on how  make better decisionsWith this information beekeepers can better predict when their bees will be needed and how  get them  their destination as safely as possible Farmers may also discover new insights about planting crops that are beneficial for beesOf Bees and Sunflower Seedsut how can all this technology help the growth of a sunflower seed Well it depends where you look For Richards son Bret Adee who is in charge of the pollination arm of the business more accurate weather forecasting could lead  better decisions about where  put their bees and when Cognitive technologies can help Adee more accurately predict when bloom conditions will be at their peak which means his bees could produce more honey and lead farmers  have a higher yield of cropsOver the last 10 years honey bee populations have decreased  up  40 percentInsecticides lack of crop diversity and climate change are all facrs in the decline of the honey bee populationThe weather has such an influence on the wildflowers bees need and a lot of times we miss the highest potential market because we misjudged the weather patterns he says If he could better forecast these patterns thousands of dollars could be saved in fuel and labor among other expensesAdee Honey Farms owns around 80000 hives like those pictured hereAdee Honey Farms owns around 80000 hives like those pictured hereThe logistics of getting the bees there could also be improved with Watson To ship some 460 truckloads each year Bret Adee chooses routes that are the least stressful for the bees That means consistent temperatures of between 20 and 60 degrees and as few sps as possible Using cognitive technologies Bret Adee and his team could identify the best routes road conditions and temperatures  transport the bees as well as take seasonal impacts like floods and droughts in accountPollination is just one of many facrs contributing  the delicate ecosystem allowing plants like sunflowers  grow Heres how cognitive technologies is making a difference in other areas affecting agriculture and businessHoneybee populations have decreased  up  40 percent annually since 2006Insecticides and habitat reduction are among facrs causing the decline of honeybeeswaterCalifornias almond crops are some of the most heavily reliant on pollination services But almonds will not

who persuaded Ford  hire them in the late 1940s from Harvard where they had perfected statistical management techniques for the Army Air ForcesOriginally called the quiz kids because they peppered their Ford colleagues with probing questions the team included Robert S McNamara who would also become a Ford president and later secretary of defense in the administrations of Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B JohnsonDuring Mr Millers presidency Ford reported record sales and earnings introduced the Mustang and other slickback models and revolutionized its sdgy management and financial practicesWhen Congress demanded that Detroit do more  prevent accidents Ford responded proactively  acknowledging that the industry had been slow  embrace au safety and pledging  support whatever

Deal claims  doWhen Schumer Pelosi and other Democrats seek  make the case for a better deal they face an audience primed  disbelieve every word they sayI asked Pete Brodnitz the founder of Expedition Strategies one of the firms that conducted this survey whether he thought there was a link between Trumps emphasis on immigration Latino gangs and crime and the Democrats efforts  shift the agenda  economic policyThis has been building for months but it has become pronounced recently he wrote in an email The Trump administration hopes Democrats will react  defending immigration and look soft on gangs  aware that if they push the envelope on this issue they can get coverage for their efforts and drown out Democratic efforts  change the picBrodnitz described Trumps tactics as offering ideas that sound really outlandish but that they believe have popular support  at least with their core voters and that the Long Island speech was based on the hope that Democrats would look more concerned about criminals than about crime and its victimsTo put it mildly it has been difficult for the Democrats  recruit key white voters  consider an economic agenda in the face of concerted efforts  the Trump campaign and his administration  shift the focus  crimeI asked a prominent political scientist  a man with generally moderate views  for his reaction  Trumps comments in the Long Island speech His answer surprised me Requesting anonymity in order  speak candidly he repliedI think yeah a lot of people whites anyway think that the police are o constrained When I watch the anarchists tear up Oakland which happens pretty regularly a part of me thinks where are the 1968 Chicago police when we really need them These thugs behave the way they do in part because there are no consequences Also we see a lot of cases on TV where someone is resisting arrest the police wrestle him down and hit him a few times and then there are complaints about excessive force Heavens sakes if someone doesnt comply with an order what are the police supposed  doOne question Haidts survey asks respondents is whether they agree or disagree with the idea that a criminal should be made  suffer in the same way that his victim sufferedHaidt said progressives strongly reject it and it correlates fairly well with politics  the farther right you are the more you endorse itWhat then does Pinker make of Trumps Long Island speechIt appeals  one of our worst angels the desire for rough justice  quick and brutal revenge inflicted on a suspected wrongdoer The ultimate evolutionary rationale for revenge vendettas blood feuds mob violence summary justice lynching vigilantes deadly ethnic riots the code of the streets and other forms of rough justice is deterrence if a person anticipates getting beaten up for exploiting people hell think twice about exploiting themTrump in Pinkers view has focused on the most primitive and regressive emotions among votersSo yes Trump is wisecracking about overturning millennia of progress in taming our brutish instincts for instant retaliation and discarding the norms and institutions of justice that our better angels have crafted and perfectedPinker sees this as part of an ongoing struggleThe appeal of regressive impulses is perennial The forces of liberalism modernity cosmopolitanism the open society and Enlightenment values always have  push against our innate tribalism authoritarianism and thirst for vengeanceAnd yesat times in hisry the darker forces prevail  the two world wars the American crime wave from the 1960s  early 1990s the rise of civil war in the developing world over that same period These darker forces moreover are not just raw instincts but often rationalized in ideologiesThe connection may not seem obvious at first but Pinkers comments are directly relevant  the Democratic Partys attempt  counter Trump with liberal economic policiesNot only is their adversary a man ungoverned  rule or tradition but he is a man who has taken our impulses of authoritarianism and tribalism  quote Pinker one last time and constructed an edifice of rationalization around themThis puts the Democrats in a dangerous position The more they succeed in pushing Trump up against a wall politically speaking the more they risk the possibility that the he will inflict real damage whether it is hostile engagement abroad or increasingly aggressive attacks on democratic institutions at homeIt is ominous that Trump has already hit upon the use of force as his preferred solution when confronting domestic lawandorder issues One hates  think of what a man with his mindset can do with a nuclear arsenal and the world as his stagethe strange specter of an American presidents seeming affection for strongmen and authoritarians created such a cognitive dissonance among my generation of conservatives  who had come of age under existential threat from the Soviet Union  that it was almost impossible  believeConservativeshave maintained an unnerving silence as instability has ensued To carry on in the spring of 2017 as if what was happening was anything approaching normalcy required a determined suspension of critical facultiesWhat Flake recognizes and what Democrats are only coming  realize is that Trump represents a systemic assault on the legitimacy of Americas democratic processes an attack that needs  be countered  far more that a modest collection of economic policies organized under the rubric a better dealFlakes open defection is an important step If it is  become a serious problem for Trump Flakes Republican colleagues  Susan Collins Bob Corker Lindsey Graham John McCain Lisa Murkowksi Rob Portman and Ben Sasse come  mind  will have  join him and not just one vote at a time For a challenge

WASHINGTON  He has a reputation as a principled lawyer He has worked for both Republican and Democratic atrneys general He has a jugular instinct in courtroom battles but a distaste for political onesNow Rod J Rosenstein the deputy atrney general is confronting the political fight of his career Amid sustained criticism  President Trump and rumors that he will be fired Mr Rosenstein is also maneuvering  defuse demands  Republicans in Congress that Democrats say are aimed at ousting him from his job  and from his role as protecr of the special counsel Robert S Mueller IIISo far he appears  be succeeding But in trying  deflect those attacks some say Mr Rosenstein has risked eroding the Justice Departments hisric independence from political meddling The consequences could persist long after he and the rest of the Trump administration are out of powerA small but influential group of House Republicans has demanded greater access  sensitive documents related  some of the FBIs most politically charged investigations in the Trump campaign and Hillary Clinns handling of classified emails Should Mr Rosenstein fail  comply they have threatened  subpoena him hold him in contempt of Congress or even impeach himThe Republicans complain that Mr Rosenstein and other Justice Department officials have slowwalked or outright snewalled their requests for reams of documents and other information they need  conduct oversight When they do receive documents they say o many are showing up with critical content blacked outThis is serious stuff said Representative Jim Jordan a conservative Ohio Republican allied with Mr Trump who voiced his complaints in a recent meeting with Mr Rosenstein We as a separate and equal branch of government are entitled  get the informationMr Rosenstein 53 has staved off his attackers on Capil Hill largely  appeasing them Two weeks ago he allowed key Republican legislars  review an almost completely unredacted FBI memo on the opening of a still active investigation of the Trump campaign a rare step He later summoned two other Republicans Mr Jordan and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina  his office  pledge that the Justice Department would be more responsive  their requestsBut still other Republican demands remain unmet and Democrats have warned that Mr Rosenstein is being boxed in a corner where he has  choose between saving his job and setting disturbing precedents that chip away at the independence that the Justice Department has maintained since President Richard M Nixon tried  thwart the Watergate investigation That independence keeps the country from sliding in a banana republic said Matthew Miller a former Justice Department spokesman under Atrney General Eric H Holder JrStephen E Boyd the Justice Departments assistant atrney general for legislative affairs said The department is responding  what it believes  be good faith requests for information pursuant  Congresss appropriate oversight function and the department is doing so in a way that will not have any adverse impact on ongoing investigationsOthers said they worried that in solving his shortterm political problems Mr Rosenstein could expose the department  increasingly onerous congressional demands in continuing investigations  an area that has traditionally been off limitsIt could become an exception that swallows the rule said Senar Richard Blumenthal Democrat of Connecticut and a former federal prosecur Every request  Congress can be made  seem exceptionalIn one of Washingns odder embraces their strongest defenders are congressional Democrats who abhor the Justice Departments policies under the Trump administration but see Mr Rosenstein as a firewall between the president and the special counselMr Rosenstein declined requests for an interview but supporters say he is well positioned  defend himself A careful and conservative lawyer he is unlikely  make missteps or overstep boundaries they say A highranking former Justice Department official described him as the ultimate survivorEarly in his tenure he stumbled when he wrote a memo  Mr Sessions castigating Mr Comey for speaking publicly about the FBI investigation in Mrs Clinns handling of classified information while secretary of state Although Mr Trump has repeatedly cited it as justification for firing Mr Comey Mr Rosenstein ld Congress that the memo was not meant  justify a forcause termination Even so he acknowledged that he knew Mr Comeys job was in danger when he wrote itRod got suckered  the president in writing the memo said Philip B Heymann a former Justice Department official and one of Mr Rosensteins menrs Trump marched his deputy atrney general way out on a limb and then left him thereHe and others suggest that Mr Rosenstein appointed Mr Mueller as special counsel partly  redeem himself That was the only way Rod could show he was not a lackey that he was neutral Mr Heymann saidMr Sessions has scant ability  provide his deputy cover If the president is mulling Mr Rosensteins fate he holds a deeper animus ward Mr Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigationMr Rosenstein addresses his own jeopardy with a blend of sicism and black humor according  friends I may need  talk  you about a job he jested  one Washingnarea lawyerHe is not however trying  whip up political support for himself He doesnt do the selfpreservation game said James M Trusty a friend who worked with him in Maryland Hes very grounded and fatalistic He plays it  the bookMr Rosenstein is proceeding as though he will not be fired On Monday he is arguing a sentencing guidelines case on behalf of the federal government before the Supreme CourtMr Rosenstein grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs attended the University of Pennsylvania and graduated from Harvard Law School in 1989 He became a trial lawyer in the Justice Departments public integrity section in Washingn and eventually worked with Kenneth W Starr the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinns business dealings In 2005 President George W Bush appointed him the United States atrney for Maryland President Barack Obama kept him onThe office he ran had been rn apart  political infighting and had a weak relationship with local law enforcement In his first few months Mr Rosenstein gathered information from employees about what had gone wrong then restructured the office He reached out  state prosecurs and encouraged his staff members  work with them  fight violent crime His ability  transcend politics gave him credibility according  many who worked with himI never heard a political word escape from his lips said Brian E Frosh the Democratic Maryland atrney general He was smart honest fair ugh  everything you want in a prosecurMr Sessions barely knew Mr Rosenstein when he became his deputy and Mr Rosenstein had no obvious political patron He was not expecting  become a household name When his daughter asked whether his new job meant that he was now famous he ld her that few people know or care who served as deputy atrney generalHe and Mr Sessions had little in common beyond their lengthy tenures as federal prosecurs and shared views on gangs drugs and violent crime And the tensions that almost always exist between atrneys general and their deputies have been exacerbated  the special counsel investigation and the resulting political pressuresBut associates say the men have bonded in the face of attacks from the White HouseAfter Mr Trump publicly exploded against Mr Rosenstein this month Mr Sessions called Donald F McGahn II the White House counsel  warn that firing the deputy atrney general would have damaging consequences including the possible resignation of Mr Sessions himself according  a person briefed on the conversationMr Sessions ld Mr McGahn that the president needed  know that he believed that firing Mr Rosenstein would be a misstep and that he had done nothing  justify such an ousterMr Rosensteins oversight of the special counsels office gives him broad powers  approve or ve Mr Muellers investigative requests Democrats and some Republicans worry that the president could fire Mr Rosenstein and install a replacement who would use that power  narrow the scope of the special counsels inquiryDemocratic senars have circulated a document arguing that a new deputy atrney general could deny Mr Mueller the power  take investigative steps and decline  sign off on staff or resources essentially undermining the investigation without officially ending it or prompting the kind of Republican backlash on Capil Hill that firing Mr Mueller almost certainly would A new appointee could also refuse  publicly release a report when Mr Muellers investigation concludesAt the same time the presidents staunchest supporters on Capil Hill have put themselves in one standoff after another with Mr Rosenstein Among others he has faced escalating demands and complaints from three committee chairmen Representatives Robert W odlatte of the Judiciary Committee Devin Nunes of the Intelligence Committee and Trey wdy of the Oversight CommitteeIn a separate request Mr odlatte and others have issued a subpoena for hundreds of thousands of documents  an extraordinary number even for Congress  related  the Clinn inquiry the firing of the FBIs former deputy direcr and other matters When the lawmakers began complaining that the documents were coming slowly and with o much content blacked out the Justice Department appointed a United States atrney in Illinois  oversee document review and production The FBI doubled the number of employees working on responses  a request for materials the Justice Departments inspecr general was using  54 people working two shifts a day from 8 am  midnightBut some Republicans are still unsatisfied and have said a contempt citation or even impeachment  exceedingly rare steps that would require votes in the House  are still possibilities Democrats fear that taken gether the Republican requests are meant  offer Mr Trump cover or even cause  fire Mr RosensteinIn a meeting with Mr Rosenstein in recent days Mr Jordan and Mr Meadows tried  impress upon him that they needed the documents they sought Otherwise Mr Meadows said later lawmakers would be left with no choice but  begin building a case  hold Mr Rosenstein in contempt of Congress or  try  impeach himContempt is obviously still on the horizon Mr Meadows said if there is not a substantial changeMichael S Schmidt contributed reporting from

CELINA Ohio  As he runs for the Senate Representative James B Renacci is promising  put Ohio first echoing President Trumps America First sloganAs he tries  unseat Senar Sherrod Brown Mr Renacci is cloaking himself in the Trump aura hoping that he can replicate the success that Mr Trump found in this state in the 2016 presidential election But it is a cloak that may rest uncomfortably on the shoulders of an affluent softspoken businessman cut far more from the mold of the old Republican Party than Mr Trumps new oneAnd if Mr Renacci can clear the hurdle of Tuesdays Republican Senate primary here he will face another far higher one in Mr Brown a gravelly voiced populist whose longstanding support for protectionist trade policies infrastructure spending and entitlements like Medicare and Social Security is more in line with Mr Trump than the Jim Renacci who was elected  Congress in 2010 as an oldline smallgovernment conservativeBut as Mr Renacci sees it after helping  send Mr Trump  the White House Ohio voters now have a chance  remove one of the impediments standing in the presidents way  denying Mr Brown a Democrat from serving a third termThe reason why the president endorsed me and asked me  run is he wants somebody who can help him get his agenda done not somebody whos going  vote against him Mr Renacci said as he sat in a booth at a chickenwing restaurant hereBusinessmen and businesswomen have different styles he conceded Im more the quiet styleAll of that makes his embrace of Mr Trump an imperfect fit For one thing Mr Trump pledged  drain the swamp and Mr Renacci who was first elected  the House nearly eight years ago is testing just how long someone can be in Washingn before becoming part of what must be drainedIn fact not o long ago Mr Renacci wanted out of Congress entirely He had been running for governor but he switched  the Senate race after Josh Mandel the Republican state treasurer dropped out of the contestThis is a guy that doesnt work the room said David B Cohen a politicalscience professor at the University of Akron Its unclear whether he really enjoys what he does for a living right nowIn Tuesdays primary Mr Renacci faces competition for Trump voters who might again be drawn  someone who presents himself as an insurgent His main opponent is Mike Gibbons a wealthy investment banker who speaks admiringly of Mr Trumps agenda and raised money for him when he was running for presidentIm an outsider and Im blunt and I tell the truth Mr Gibbons said at a rally outside Cincinnati on Thursday where he appeared with Senar Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky The establishment is all behind the other guy Mr Paul said of Mr Renacci not meaning it as a complimentIn an interview Mr Gibbons said Mr Renacci simply did not connect with people and could not beat Mr Brown At the rally he was unsparing One of the best things I have going for me is when Jim Renacci speaks  a group I get more votes he said  laughs Id like  increase his speaking engagementsAnother complication is the issue of tradeMr Renacci  contrast has voted for trade agreements with South Korea Colombia and Panama and he also supported giving President Barack Obama enhanced tradenegotiating powerThe trade issue has been difficult for Renacci because he is really your typical bigbusiness Republican Professor Cohen said Trumps more populist ne on issues like trade dovetails really well with Sherrod Browns position on trade and other populist issues that Brown has been advocating for decadesAsked about trade Mr Renacci struggled He suggested that Mr Brown was focused on protecting steelworkers at the expense of other industries like farming and manufacturing  precisely the criticism leveled at Mr Trump He then suggested that the president is coming around  his viewsWhat hes doing is hes listening learning and then hes going  lead so in the end I think the tariff policies and programs will change Mr Renacci said of Mr Trump In the end hell get closer  what Ohio needsMr Renaccis embrace of Mr Trump carries an obvious danger turning off voters who see a risk that he would simply be a rubber stampWhen President Trump came out and said Take the guns first well worry about due process later we want the guy thats going  say Hold on now she said And were afraid Jim Renacci will say Yes sirMr Brown is one of 10 Democratic senars who are running in November in states won  Mr Trump though the Ohio race is not generally seen as one of the Democrats most imperiled seatsIn a western Ohio county along the Indiana border that Mr Trump won with 80 percent of the vote Mr Renacci previewed in an interview how he planned  turn voters against Mr Brown He described the senar as a career politician and someone far o liberal for the state that he representsIve said all along Sherrod probably could represent Massachusetts very well he said Probably represent New York maybe Maybe even California But his votes dont represent OhioPresn Maddock a spokesman for the Brown campaign responded While Congressman Renacci finds new ways  help himself get ahead Sherrod is fighting for Ohioans every day  including working with this administration and his Republican colleagues in the Senate when its best for Ohio workersAnd then there is Mr Renaccis bearhug embrace of Mr Trump right down  his Twitter rantsThe one thing I hear a lot is I love the president I just wish he wouldnt tweet as much he said And my answer is if you love the president you got  love everything about him including thatCollapse,business
The Trump administration opened the door  allowing more firearms on federal lands It scrubbed references  LGBTQ youth from the description of a federal program for victims of sex trafficking And on the advice of religious leaders it eliminated funding  international groups that provide abortionWhile these initiatives lacked the fanfare of some of President Trumps highprofile proclamations  like his ban on transgender people in the military  they point  a fundamental repurposing of the federal bureaucracy  promote conservative social prioritiesThe aggressive regulary effort which runs counter  the Trump administrations lessismore credo about government meddling has led  policy changes related  gun ownership gay rights reproductive choices immigration and other divisive political issues according  a New York Times review of government documents and court records as well as interviews with more than four dozen people involved in or briefed on the effortsThe overhaul is unfolding behind the scenes in Washingn at agencies like the Health and Human Services Department where new rules about birth control are being drafted and in federal courtrooms where the Justice Department has shifted gears in more than a dozen Obamaera cases involving social issuesThe turnabout stems in part from lobing  evangelical Christians and other conservative groups In interviews these groups said they have regular discussions on domestic and foreign policy with the administration  more so than during the presidency of George W Bush the last Republican  occupy the White House and someone who identified as a Christian conservativeEverybody has points of contact and not just secretaries either said Johnnie Moore a Christian leader who owns a public relations firm and advises the White House on religious matters It is higher up people  direcrs or deputy direcrs And it is all across the governmentTop White House officials have led the outreach including Jared Kushner Mr Trumps Orthodox Jewish soninlaw and Vice President Mike Pence a staunch social and religious Christian conservative Kellyanne Conway a senior aide counted some of these groups among her paying clients before joining the White HouseYet the new direction has also met some resistance among rankandfile civil servants Within the Justice Department several longserving lawyers have decided  retire or quit rather than help carry out the new policies according  people briefed on the departuresWhile turnover is natural after an election some of these departing lawyers worked at the department through previous Republican administrations  under Ronald Reagan and both Bushes  and they have privately ld colleagues that recent changes twist the law in directions that make them uncomfortableFor example a debate arose over immigration in recent weeks when highranking Justice Department officials explored whether they could apply a law commonly used  prosecute businesses  instead punish socalled sanctuary cities according  several former officials briefed on the issueMr Trump has roundly criticized these cities which limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities and he has threatened  withhold federal funding  them Some of the departments veteran lawyers opposed the more aggressive options as not legally justifiableSome of these lawyers also faced the unpalatable task of undoing their work defending Obamaera regulations such as those on birth control and transgender rights Rather than help roll back those rules the officials decided  leave the government according  the people briefed on the departures who were not authorized  speak publicly about personnel mattersAll of the things you count on the Justice Departments institutional bureaucracy for  thoughtful deliberate attention  process including all stakeholders  it seems  have been thrown out said Sharon Mcwan a former senior career official who joined the Justice Department in 2010 and worked in the civil rights division until departing a few weeks in the Trump administrationMs Mcwan the only former career official who agreed  comment for this article noted that some of her former colleagues are staying despite concernsSome are absolutely staying because they feel like theyre afraid of whod get put in their seat if they left said Ms Mcwan who now works at Lambda Legal an advocacy organization focused on LGBT rightsA Justice Department spokesman declined  comment while a White House spokesman said that the president is proud  promote a conservative agenda that has been far o long ignored  the Obama administrationDespite their bond some religious conservatives have expressed disappointment in Mr Trump or faced pressure  distance themselves from controversial positions Some denounced Mr Trumps response last month  the violence in Charlottesville Va and disagreed with his move  end the program that blocks young undocumented immigrants from being deportedFor Mr Trump who only recently adopted socially conservative causes an alliance with the religious right might seem an odd fit And with his newfound dealmaking with Democrats in Congress it is unknown if his social priorities might change But these conservative groups voted for him in large numbers and as president Mr Trump has remained loyal He appointed Neil rsuch a favorite of social conservatives  the Supreme Court and he scked his cabinet with others like Atrney General Jeff SessionsThe alliance has alarmed social liberals who enjoyed considerable vicries and an expansion of rights under the Obama administrationWith the shift in Washingn many p conservative groups have increased their spending on lobing In the first half of this year the National Rifle Association almost doubled what it spent in the same period last year according  Senate dataSpending  the p antiabortion lobing groups increased as well The Susan B Anthony List spent 390000 in the first half of this year and projected it would spend 400000 in the second half almost doubling the yearly tal for 2016 which had been its biggest yearAnd for the first time the group has directed some of that money ward lobing the White House and Health and Human Services Department instead of targeting only CongressMallory Quigley communications direcr for the group which backs political candidates opposed  abortion said that over the last eight years it never even had an opportunity  start building relationships with the executive branchIn early March Steven J Lechner the p lawyer for the Mountain States Legal Foundation was feverishly preparing  argue a gunrights case in court when he received a call from the Justice DepartmentThe Obama administrations Justice Department had spent more than three years defending a policy that largely prohibits firearms on Army Corps of Engineers property Mr Lechners group wanted  overturn the policy setting up the court battleBut the Trump administration the caller indicated was rethinking the governments support for the prohibitionOn the eve of oral arguments the Justice Department filed an emergency motion stating that the Army Corps was reconsidering the firearms policy challenged in this case sending the case  mediation The Justice Departments motion signaled a likely vicry for Mr Lechner stating that this reconsideration has the potential  fully resolve plaintiffs objectionsA spokesman for the Army Corps referred questions about the case  the Justice Department but added that the agency is accepting public comments on a number of existing regulations not just the firearms ruleThe Army Corps case is among those identified  The Times  more than a dozen this year  in which the Trump administration ok a right turn on contentious social issues in court And because the Justice Department represents a wide array of federal agencies in legal matters it is on the front lines of the shift on those issuesIn each of the cases identified  The Times the Justice Department either reversed an earlier position announced that the government was reconsidering an existing rule or became newly involved in a legal fight court records showTwo of the cases focused on the Army Corpss firearm ban while others pertained  voting issues In at least nine cases the department stated in court papers that the Trump administration was considering changing an Affordable Care Act rule that requires companies  provide employees with free insurance coverage for birth controlThe Justice Department also recently filed court papers in a discrimination case before the Supreme Court siding with a baker who refused  provide a wedding cake  a samesex coupleBut the departments advocacy has not been limited  the courtroom It also has issued new initiatives and eliminated othersThe final version of the new policy outlined in an FBI memo in the early weeks of the Trump administration went further It prohibits people from buying guns if they flee the state  avoid law enforcement but only if they are subject  a current or imminent criminal prosecution or testimonial obligationChanges have also occurred at the Justice Department office that handles juvenile programs In May the office sought applications from nonprofit organizations and state and local governments  apply for a longrunning grant program that funds menring for child victims of sex trafficking But there was a difference in this years application There were no references  sexual orientation or gender identity of the victims in the program descriptionsA year earlier under the Obama administration the program was described as focusing on the needs of girls and boys including lesbian gay bisexual transgender and questioning LGBTQ youth who are at risk or are victims of commercial sexual exploitation and domestic sex traffickingThere were seven references  LGBTQ in the document last year There were none in the new version though the Justice Department did not specifically exclude these youths from the menringSimilar changes were made  grant applications for youth homelessness programs through the Health and Human Services Department which said that the revisions complied with federal lawThat agency separately attempted  modify its data collection but retreated after being confronted  liberal groups When its surveys of older Americans were updated the agency planned  exclude a question that appeared on previous surveys about sexual orientation The data collected in the surveys is used  organize and finance programs that provide nutritional support and housing for older peopleThe order focused on protecting religious liberties ok aim at Obamaera regulations intended  protect gay people from discrimination and ensure that women have access  birth controlFlanked  Vice President Pence and Paula White a Christian televangelist who has been his spiritual adviser the president called a group of Catholic nuns  the stage The group Little Sisters of the Poor had been in a longtime legal fight with the Justice Department over the birthcontrol regulationsCongratulations Mr Trump said after two smiling nuns shook his hand They sort of just won a lawsuitMr Trumps order had no immediate effect on policy and it did not resolve the lawsuit But it did start a flurry of activity across the government  the administrative state that the Trump administration typically views with skepticism  prompting agencies  draft new policies that interpret the executive order and chip away at the Obamaera mandatesSpecifically the executive order directed Atrney General Sessions  issue guidelines for interpreting religious liberty protections in law The order also instructed federal agencies  vigorously protect religious liberties and consider issuing new rules  address consciencebased objections  health care mandatesSince then the Health Labor and Treasury Departments have been engaged in rulemaking  reconsider the birthcontrol regulation according  briefs filed  the administration in pending court casesThe round of rulemaking social conservative groups say signals the willingness of likeminded officials in the Trump cabinet and across the federal bureaucracy  take up their causesAntiabortion groups for example pointed  multiple allies in the administrationTom Price secretary of Health and Human Services opposed abortion and free birth control as a Georgia congressman Teresa Manning who heads the departments Title X program which provides family planning funding for poor people and those without health insurance was formerly a lobist with the National Right  Life Committee and analyst for the conservative Family Research Council Charmaine Yoest the assistant secretary of health and human services in charge of public affairs was once the head of Americans

decision  the liking of social conservativesGreg Baylor a senior lawyer with the group which has been among those privately advising the Justice Department called Mr Sessions remarks very encouragingIn addition  Mr Sessions a number of lesserknown officials on his staff are shaping the new direction according  former officials briefed on the matterAmong them is Rachel Brand the departments third highest ranking official behind Mr Sessions and Deputy Atrney General Rod RosensteinMs Brand has deep conservative credentials Once active in the Federalist Society she worked for

the Senate confirmation processMs Brand a political appointee has also served on the agencys deregulation team which was ordered  President Trump in February  identify regulations  eliminateAnother official Hashim Mooppan has been involved in cases in which the Justice Department has taken a conservative pivot Mr Mooppan a deputy assistant atrney general overseeing appeals cases joined the

Common SenseBy the past he presumably means oldfashioned valuation measures like priceearnings or pricesales ratios the traditional benchmarks for evaluating sck prices By those measures Tesla  a company that lost 773 million last year  is indeed off the chartsTeslas market value of nearly 49 billion is not only higher than that of Ford which earned nearly 11 billion in profit last year but is within easy striking distance of General Mors which earned 94 billionIn contrast  Tesla Ford and GM shares have dropped recently on fears that au sales have hit a cyclical peak Ford and GM executives wouldnt comment on Teslas sck surge but its easy  imagine theyd be tearing their hair out in frustrationIts nuts Bruce Greenwald a professor at Columbia Business School and an expert in value investing said of Teslas sck price Invesrs believe its going  dominate a market that no company has ever dominated beforeBut Tesla is not a sck or a company that is measured  the past as Mr Musk is well aware He also wrote on Twitter that sck prices represent riskadjusted future cash flows  and Tesla is about nothing if not a upian future of safe reliable powerful selfdriving electric vehicles powered  solarfed batteries that are easy on the environmentIn that regard Tesla has ascended in a rarefied realm of socalled sry scks  companies that have so bewitched invesrs that their sck prices are impervious  any traditional valuation measures because their sries are simply o good not  be trueAnd  the dismay of shortsellers who believe they have ample rational reasons  bet against such scks their share prices can stay in the strasphere for years even decadesThese sry scks  the term was coined  James Montier a value invesr and a member of the asset allocation team at the investment management firm GMO  are relatively rare but hardly new Amazons sck surged for decades even without any meaningful profits A more recent example is Snapchats parent Snap which is racking up large losses while its sck trades at an astronomical pricesales ratio of nearly 50 far higher than Teslas 7 Fords  comparison is 03Amazon and Snap both have sries that are compelling for many invesrs Amazon has transformed retailing and is destined  dominate it Snap is reinventing communication at least for millennials and those even youngerEarly invesrs in Uber and Airbnb though they remain private companies have valued them at straspheric multiples based largely on the notion that Uber will transform and dominate local transportation and Airbnb will revolutionize the hotel industryFor sry scks any development that lends credence  the sry can cause a surge in already high valuations This week Tesla reported quarterly sales that were modestly above expectations and the sck surged 7 percent in a day Tesla shares are up nearly 40 percent this year even though many invesrs considered them overvalued in JanuaryRon Baron the billionaire invesr and founder of Baron Capital disclosed last year that he owned about 16 million Tesla shares He predicted on CNBC in February that Tesla shares would quadruple  2020 and triple again  2025 By then he expects Tesla  become the largest company in the world as measured  market capitalizationFor all the excitement and promise surrounding such companies there are many cautionary talesSries are great before bed but are disastrous as a sckselection

believe its sry as that is all you haveA Tesla spokeswoman said Mr Musk could not be reached for commentVarious studies have shown that scks with high pricesales ratios on average significantly underperform market averages For every Tesla or Uber theres a Valeant Pharmaceuticals or Theranos  two sry scks that seduced an asunding array of prominent invesrs and supporters based on sries that did turn out  be o good  be trueAnd while many invesrs memories tend  be short the socalled dotcom bubble in the late 1990s spawned scores of sry scks nearly all of them now worthless and forgottenStill Mr Montier acknowledged Sries are compelling They appeal  intuition rather than reason But perhaps invesrs would be well advised  follow Odysseuss example of putting beeswax in his crews ears and tying himself  the mast in order  avoid the disastrous but oh so desirable call of the Siren songWill Tesla be one of the rare exceptions and as Mr Baron has predicted emerge as the worlds most valuable companyThe company has won over many skeptics with its nearflawless execution so far and the high quality of its vehicles and high levels of consumer satisfaction It is no longer a startup It delivered 25000 vehicles in the last quarter It is on track  achieve economies of scale and the company says the gross margin on each vehicle is above 20 percent far higher than the industry average That could drive enormous future profitsBut thats not the Tesla sry  or sries  invesrs are betting onAdam Jonas a Morgan Stanley aumotive analyst who is hardly a starryeyed optimist about the industry upgraded Tesla shares  overweight in January He singles out the companys new aunomous driving technology as a compelling safety feature that will significantly reduce occupant and pedestrian injuries and fatalities This week he said he expected vehicle safety  be the primary differentiar in Teslas upcoming product offensive referring  the eagerly anticipated introduction of Teslas new lowerprice Model 3 which will be equipped with the new technologyThat Tesla is an allelectric environmentally friendly nonfossilfuel vehicle  the sry that once excited invesrs  is barely mentioned anymoreEven more futuristic is the idea that Tesla cars will be entirely selfdriving able  cruise streets nearly full time except when they are being charged at Teslas highspeed batterycharging stations In this vision Tesla owners will share their vehicles with Tesla when not using them and during that time they will ferry other passengers serving as Teslas version of Uber Thus Tesla will disrupt Ubers nascent market dominanceAnd Tesla is no longer seen just as a vehicle manufacturer With its solar and battery technologies it is in a position  dominate two other enormous industry segments Tesla is reinventing the electric grid as Mr Baron said on CNBC Thats a bigger opportunity than carsEven if all that comes  pass it may not be enough  justify Teslas valuation unless it can sustain a competitive advantage over time as Mr Greenwald the value investing expert put it Tesla is spending heavily on research and development and perhaps its technology will be difficult or impossible for others  replicate The established aumakers have had years  catch up  or overtake Teslas Model S with a conspicuous lack of successBut for committed value invesrs the writing is on the wall Is Tesla going  dominate its industry Thats the key question Mr Greenwald said When it comes  the global au industry no one ever has and in all likelihood no one ever

In December 1967 an American Navy vessel called the Pueblo departed Pearl Harbor heading for Yokosuka Japan It was the last time the ship a dilapidated former cargo carrier now operating as an American intelligence collecr would see the United StatesIn January the Pueblo began its first mission conducting electronic intelligence operations off the coast of North Korea Then on Jan 23 1968  50 years ago day  the ship came under attack  North Korean forces The slow and poorly armed American ship was badly overmatched The captain soon surrendered with one dead and numerous wounded North Korean forces quickly boarded the Pueblo and wed the ship and her 83 crewmen  WonsanThe men spent a brutal year in North Korean prison camps where they were beaten rtured and used as propaganda ols before being released a few days before Christmas 1968 The ship is still in North Korea serving as one of the countrys leading urist attractionsThe sry of the Pueblo incident  long forgotten  most Americans  is certainly important on its own merits Beyond the details of the attack however the crisis also serves as a larger example of how Americas war in Vietnam had ramifications far beyond Southeast AsiaWonsan and Hanoi were 2000 miles apart but the war in Vietnam hovered over the Pueblo seizure from the beginning When news of the attack reached the White House the Johnson administration instinctively pointed a finger of blame not at Pyongyang but at a larger Communist conspiracy The president ld his advisers that the incident was related  the whole picture adding that he would not be surprised if something happened in Berlin  coincide with what is going on in Vietnam and in KoreaThe Soviets soon began sending backchannel signals that they had not been involved but the Johnson administration refused  accept the possibility that North Korea might have acted independently Instead President Lyndon Johnson and his advisers continued  search for larger Cold War connections  explain the attack and soon found them in Vietnam The direcr of the CIA Richard Helms warned that the North had acted for two reasons  hinder the movement of Koreans  South Vietnam and  harass the US in its conduct of the war in VietnamDeputy Secretary of Defense Paul Nitze speculated that the attack had been intended  pressure the United States in taking a weaker position on Vietnam negotiations When the North Vietnamese launched the Tet offensive a week after the seizure the link between the two seemed confirmed The North Koreans Johnson wrote were aware of the Tet offensive in Vietnam which was scheduled  take place eight days later They were trying  divert US military resources from Vietnam and pressure the South Koreans in recalling their two divisions from that areaRecently released materials from Communist bloc archives however demonstrate that there was no conspiracy behind the Pueblo seizure The North Koreans had acted alone and for reasons that reflected internal dynamics within Pyongyang rather than the exigencies of the Cold War The country had launched this and other aggressive actions on the peninsula  gain internal propaganda that emphasized the strength of Kim Il Sungs leadership and  rally the people behind him during difficult economic and political timesIn fact not only was there no larger conspiracy afoot but the Pueblo attack actually drove a wedge between the North and its Communist allies who resented Pyongyangs risky behavior and its reluctance  provide information In April the Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev blasted the North in a speech at the Soviet Party Plenum The measures taken in this case  the government of the DPRK appear unusually harsh he declared Moscow had demanded that North Korea show reserve not  give the Americans an excuse for widening provocations  settle the incident  political means But he said the Korean comrades maintained a fairly extreme position and did not show any inclination ward the settlement of the incident Other members of the Communist bloc similarly resented Kims provocations In newspaper articles and statements we were on their side the East German ambassador  Pyongyang later explained but not in realityAmerican political leaders however failed  consider the possibility of an internal motive and instinctively sought solutions rooted in conventional Cold War approaches that presumed a larger master hand was behind North Koreas behavior Throughout 1968 American policymakers negotiated with North Korean representatives but never fully accepted the idea that this diplomatic effort could be separated from the larger Cold War struggle Accordingly they rejected any resolution that might weaken their efforts on other fronts particularly in Vietnam The great danger that we must avoid is that the Soviets and the North Vietnamese will interpret something that we do as a sign of weakness outgoing Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara explained If we show weakness and are not firm I think it will prolong the Vietnam War substantially Negotiations for the prisoners in North Korea were thus held hostage  events in SaigonThis weekly newsletter includes

View all New York Times newslettersBeyond the immediate fears about sending signs of weakness American policymakers also failed  consider the possibility that they might be able  drive a wedge between the North Koreans and the rest of the Communist bloc even further The Norths relations within its allies had fallen so low  1968 that it was engaging in border skirmishes with the Chinese while also alienating its other allies and yet the United States continued  negotiate as if it faced a unified monolithAs galling as it is a National Security Council staff member advised in March I fear that on this Pueblo case we may have  lick our wounds wait out release of the crew and wait our chances for action when the advantage is more ours The only way I see where we could act sooner would be in Vietnam  presumably  mining Haiphong Harbor North Korean actions seem partly designed  aid the Communist Vietnam effort and it is important that we not permit that  happen Unable  separate Vietnam from Korea American leaders had thus sent its diplomats  do battle for the Pueblo crewmen in a badly weakened positionAmericas diplomatic response was not the only part of the Pueblo sry that was influenced  Vietnam The attack on the ship sent both the American military and the general public in a frenzy Demands for violent retaliation echoed through the halls of the Pentagon and the streets of Americas wns The office of the commander in chief of the Pacific fleet recommended sending a destroyer in Wonsan  do whatever was necessary  retrieve the ship and crew and the commander of the United Nations forces in South Korea an American called for a nuclear ultimatumThe public was equally aggressive A Gallup poll showed those choosing force outnumbered those choosing diplomacy  almost two  one There should be no word mincing in our demand for the swift and safe return of both ship and crew The Buffalo Daily News wrote nor should North Korea be deprived for long of the measured dose of retribution her sudden belligerency has so emphatically asked forThe military options however soon ran in a number of practical obstacles including the strong North Korean defenses in the Wonsan area the risk of conflict with the Soviets or Chinese and concerns for the safety of the Pueblo crewmen Hovering over all of the discussions though were the demands of fighting the war in Vietnam Begrudgingly military leaders soon recognized that opening another front in East Asia would be a terrible tactical decision Within a week of the attack the chairman of the Joint Chiefs offered Johnson almost a dozen military options ranging from mining North Korean ports  striking targets with air and naval bombardments but admitted that he did not find any of them particularly attractive Accordingly military options were discarded One war at a time Under Secretary of State Nicholas Katzenbach said is enoughEven the publics response  the crisis was shaped  events in Vietnam For a week after the incident the Pueblo was the focus of national attention Newspapers ran profiles of brave sailors captured  the evil Communists Songs about the Pueblo graced the airwaves cars displayed bumper stickers about the ship and telegrams from private citizens offering  assist in rescue attempts flooded the White House These men promised the State Department are not nor will they ever become forgotten menYet when the Tet offensive exploded on Jan 30 American eyes quickly returned  Vietnam Soon Walter Cronkite called for an honorable exit from Vietnam a national debate exploded about the militarys request for more troops and Johnson announced that largely because of Vietnam he would not run for reelection In the haze of such Vietnamrelated tumult the Pueblo simply faded from the nations consciousnessSupporters of the crew formed a national Remember the Pueblo Committee and offered a rallying cry  Remember the Pueblo  try  keep the men in the public eye but  no avail The crew despite the State Departments promise had indeed become forgotten men lost  the more overwhelming conflict 2000 miles away And despite suffering from serious physical and emotional problems resulting from their year in captivity the men would remain forgotten when they returned  the United States in December 1968 Quickly they were drummed from the service ignored  the general public and left  fend for themselves as they struggled  reintegrate with society often with disastrous resultsEven more significant than these immediate connections however was the impact that the convergence of Vietnam and the Pueblo incident had on shaping the longterm American commitment  South Korea American aid  the South had been declining for years and Americas military presence was coming under scrutiny as well These efforts were stymied however  South Koreas decision  commit troops  the American effort in Vietnam By 1967 South Korea had provided tens of thousands of combat troops and in return a grateful President Johnson had been ignoring the drawdown proposals The attack on the Pueblo now offered the South a chance  strengthen the relationship even morePresident Park Chung Hee of South Korea and other leaders suddenly began hinting that they might withdraw their troops from Vietnam  face the increased North Korean aggression Johnson who desperately wanted  portray Vietnam as an international effort was determined  keep them on board Accordingly he pushed through an enormous military assistance package for the South We need  give whatever aid is necessary  South Korea he ld congressional leaders They are among our best allies Johnson ok other measures  placate Park including pledging  appoint a South Korean as deputy commander of the United Nations military forces in Korea promising  increase South Korean access  business opportunities in Vietnam and working  increase economic connections between the nations In the long run of course South Korean forces fighting in Vietnam could not prevent Americas defeat They did however resre a bond that had been weakening and help cement a special relationship between the countries that still existsFifty years after the attack on the Pueblo the ships sry remains the tragic tale of 83 American men and a doomed spy ship But it is also a sry of how the impact of Americas war in Vietnam went beyond Vietnam in ways that hindered good diplomacy elsewhere ruined the lives of people far from the front lines and played a vital role in shaping the future of East AsiaMitchell B Lerner is an associate professor of hisry and

manufacturers that turn out cusm products for other companies or for the government may have just those few cusmersThere are upsides Its less complicated when an owner doesnt have a lot of accounts

aisles of Marianos an upscale supermarket near the Mondelez headquarters were stuffed with her companys creations  Oreos Wheat Thins and Ritz crackersAs Ms Rosenfeld prepares  step down as chief executive next week after 11 years leading Mondelez and its predecessor she reminisced about a career spent trying  increase sales of cookies candies and chips  and reflected on shifting consumer preferences that are demanding fresher healthier foods than the ones she championed for so longI set out  create the worlds greatest snacking company she said But the legacy Im most proud of is the ethos of this company where individuals care about one another they have each others back and they care about the world they live inA 36year veteran of big food companies Ms Rosenfeld ok over as chief executive of Kraft Foods in 2006 acquired the British chocolatier Cadbury in 2010 through a hostile takeover and split the company in two in 2012 creating MondelezWith 26 billion in annual sales and a market value of 63 billion Mondelez makes cupboard staples including Triscuits Fig Newns and Oreos as well as dozens of chocolate and biscuit brands sold around the worldMs Rosenfeld has kept up with the move ward globalization shifting away from the United States and Europe and in emerging markets like Asia and Latin America and introducing some healthier optionsAlong the way she tangled with the British government Warren Buffett and hedge fund activists including William A Ackman and Nelson Peltz  not  mention the groups advocating for healthier foods in a much more healthconscious eraBy many measures she was successful Through acquisitions spinoffs disposals and dividends she made billions of dollars for invesrs and a fortune for herselfShe has focused on building shareholder value successfully  increasing margins with no dewyeyed nostalgia over changing conditions said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld a professor at the Yale School of Management She is an honorable leader who has survived an industry going through wrenching change and pressure from ugh vocal shortterm activistsMs Rosenfeld was richly rewarded for her work In her 11 years as CEO  first of Kraft Foods and now of Mondelez  she has made about 231 million according  Equilar That does not include her compensation before 2006 or a retirement package yet  be announced that will surely be worth many millions moreBut as consumer tastes change millennials are embracing upstart brands Health concerns over processed foods are on the rise Mondelez sales were falling until the company reported an uptick last month and the sck has barely budged in the last yearMs Rosenfeld and the company say it was her decision  step down Ive been doing this for over a decade Ms Rosenfeld said Ever since I announced my retirement Ive been sleeping betterBut the board was ready for change and began looking for her replacement in the spring Dirk Van de Put head of the frozen food maker McCain Foods will take over Mondelez leaving one woman fewer at the helm of a major companyIts painful for her  leave said Lois Juliber who is on the board of Mondelez Im not sure she feels like she feels like the job is done yetBorn in Brooklyn in 1953 Ms Rosenfeld grew up on Long Island and went  college at Cornell where she played basketball and gained advanced degrees in business and marketing and statisticsAfter school she went  work for an advertising firm and then in 1981 joined General Foods which made Oscar Mayer meats and Maxwell House coffee In 1985 the cigarette maker Philip Morris which at the time also owned Kraft agreed  acquire General FoodsAs her responsibilities expanded  overseeing consumer research beverages and desserts she learned some key lessons that would inform her careerFor one she said it is important  invest and innovate which wasnt easy as a subsidiary of a cigarette maker when bacco makers were paying big settlements for health related lawsuits The parent company was pressuring the food business  deliver cash she saidBut perhaps the most important truth she came  understand was an obvious one People like  eat cookies They like  eat chips They like  snackIts an exceptionally impulsedriven set of products so consumption is expandable she said The more displays we would put up in a sre like this the more products we would sellBut with those sales successes came the negative connotations associated with peddling junk food  a nation of consumers who increasingly sought out healthier and fresher options Noting that there is an accelerating interest in wellbeing everywhere in the world Ms Rosenfeld said Mondelez ok the issue seriously removing genetically modified ingredients from Triscuits offering resealable packages of Oreos and introducing relatively healthy brands like Va a new biscuit lineKraft went public in 2001 and Ms Rosenfeld ran the Canadian business the operations group and  2002 all of North AmericaBut the higher she rose the fewer women there were  her side Ms Rosenfeld said she had experienced sexism on the job but declined  provide detailsI grew up in the industry at a time when there werent that many women and in key positions she said There was always a sense that we needed  work just a little harder and we had  stand up for ourselves in the face of managers who werent as respectful as they ought  have beenMs Rosenfeld said that she thought her athleticism gave her an edge and that men were impressed that she could often beat them at tennis and golf during company retreats I held my own in a lot of these corporate outings she said I came with a sharply honed competitive instinctIn the wake of a flurry of sexual harassment revelations in the business world Ms Rosenfeld encouraged female professionals  have a zerolerance policy for abuse Do what in your heart you know is right she said It is easy  get caught up in your ambitions but no job is worth not being true  yourselfAnd Ms Rosenfeld said she had championed women in the workplace Fourteen of her employees have gone on  become chief executives of major companies including Denise Morrison of Campbell Soup and Michele Buck of HersheyIn 2004 after 23 years at the same company Ms Rosenfeld left Kraft  run the FriLay division of PepsiCo She would have stayed there longer but in 2006 she got an offer  run her old company and became the chief executive of Kraft FoodsAt the time Kraft was dominated  big American brands like Velveeta and its eponymous boxed Macaroni  Cheese Ms Rosenfeld set out  change that She acquired Lu a cookie maker with a big business in Europe And she set her eyes on Cadbury the British chocolatierAfter waiting and watching for two years Ms Rosenfeld approached Cadbury with a hostile takeover bid in 2009 The company resisted depicting her as a greedy outsider and appealed  the British public  protect a cherished national brand In an effort  defend themselves the company draped itself in the Union Jack she saidTo attend meetings during the takeover campaign she would land at airports outside London so as not  be detected and check in hotels using the pseudonym Debbie Friedman her favorite Jewish folk singerSome Kraft shareholders including Mr Buffett disapproved of the acquisition One of the reasons Buffett was concerned was he didnt want  be diluted she saidBut Ms Rosenfeld was undeterred  Mr Buffett or the British and the 20 billion deal got doneAt a management meeting in July of 2010 Ms Rosenfeld said she surveyed the room and realized she was looking at two companies So in 2011 she announced that the company would be halved  with Kraft focused on savory American staples and a new company Mondelez focused on a global snacks business The name is a Romance language mashup suggesting a world  monde  thats deliciousMondelez sck has risen more than 50 percent over the last five years but hedge fund managers like Mr Ackman and Mr Peltz are rarely satisfied Ms Rosenfeld has dealt with both men for years and Mr Peltz now sits on the Mondelez board She grudgingly accepts that activists are here  stay but said There is a shortterm orientation that is not necessarily healthy for sustainable businessesAs her career winds down Ms Rosenfeld  who earned a fortune breaking glass ceilings and shaped the fates of so many important brands  remains a company loyalist  the end She even sees the steady progress of women in the workplace  something she has championed  as a tailwind for her businessWere seeing more and more women not eating traditional meals she said excitedly Its a great thing for

California is using every power it has  and some it doesnt   frustrate federal law enforcement he said in a speech in Sacramen So you can be sure Im going  use every power I have  sp themOne of the weapons Mr Sessions is counting on is a 2012 Supreme Court ruling siding with the Obama administration which had sued Arizona for violating federal immigration laws But in that case Mr Obamas lawyers accused the state of going o far in trying  find and punish unauthorized immigrantsThe state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote for the majoritySo it may turn out that the principle of federal supremacy over immigration established  the Obama administration will help the Trump Justice Department achieve diametrically different goalsThe California case seems likely  reach the Supreme Court where it could give rise  a landmark reckoning on the role of states in setting immigration policy In the process state and federal officials along with judges and justices will face a test of their commitment  consistencyThey will face stark choices One is  apply legal principles established in a case that mostly protected immigrants  one that seeks  imperil them Another is  revise those principles in light of the very different circumstancesThe suit is modeled on the Obama administrations successful suit against Arizona he said But he added that some of the key considerations are flippedIn the Arizona case conservatives insisted that respect for state sovereignty required letting states play a leading role in controlling immigration within their borders But Mr Sessions a longtime conservative himself disavowed that position in his speech on Wednesday Immigration law is the province of the federal government he saidJustice Annin Scalia the conservative jurist who died in 2016 ok a different view of the Arizona case In an impassioned partial dissent he wrote that it is easy  lose sight of the states traditional role in regulating immigration  and  overlook their sovereign prerogative  do soThere is no doubt that the California lawsuit is at odds with some of the Trump administrations usual positions Its a fascinating suit on a number of levels Professor Vladeck said not the least of which is the aggressive assertion of federal enforcement power directly against states  those like Atrney General Sessions who have hisrically been ardent defenders of states rights in the deeply analogous contextsBoth administrations claim that the state laws they challenge impermissibly interfere with the executive branchs ability  enforce the immigration laws she said But both lawsuits are also clearly designed  take on visible and politically powerful local officials whose vision of immigration policy conflicts with the presidents and his supportersIn a news conference on Wednesday Xavier Becerra the California atrney general said he was ready for the fight The states laws he said were fully constitutional and provide for the safety and welfare of all our peopleCalifornia is in the business of public safety he said We are not in the business of deportationsThe Justice Department challenged parts of three of Californias socalled sanctuary laws One restricts employers from cooperating with immigration officials A second generally prohibits state officials from telling federal ones when undocumented immigrants are  be released from state cusdy A third requires state officials  inspect some facilities that house people detained on behalf of the federal governmentEach state law presents different issues and courts may give varying answers depending on how directly the state laws conflict with federal ones More generally though courts will take account of the Supreme Courts decision in the Arizona case which called for collaboration rather than conflictConsultation between federal and state officials is an important feature of the immigration system Justice Kennedy wrote in the courts decision in the Arizona casev Jerry Brown a Democrat has said that consultation is fine but that federal officials should not use Californias resources  pursue undocumented Californians The federal government he added may do so on its ownThey are free  use their own considerable resources  enforce federal immigration law in California he said in Ocber in signing one of the challenged lawsContrary  what you might hear from the lawless open borders radicals he said we are not asking California Oakland or anyone else  enforce immigration lawsWe are simply asking California and other sanctuary jurisdictions  sp actively obstructing federal law enforcement he addedBut Professor Rodriguez said the commandeering issue was a substantial one To the extent the Trump administrations claims against California would produce an outcome that would effectively force states and localities  participate in immigration enforcement she said there could be an unconstitutional commandeeringProfessor Spiro said that California may have the upper hand in the suits early stages as the issues in it are novel leaving judges with substantial discretionThe Trump administration has not fared well in federal courts in California in other cases concerning immigration including ones challenging President Trumps efforts  restrict travel from predominantly Muslim countries and  rescind a program protecting some 700000 young unauthorized immigrants from deportationBut the ultimate fate of the suit will probably rest with the Supreme Court In 2012 with what may have been unwarranted optimism Justice Kennedy said he hoped that conflicts over immigration policy would be worked out through reasoned discussionThe national government has significant power  regulate immigration he wrote The sound exercise of national power over immigration depends on the nations meeting its responsibility  base its laws on a political will informed  searching thoughtful rational civic discourseCollapse,business
Corner OfficeQ What were your early years likeThe men who worked there made me do the final wiping outside in the winter and everybody else was on the steamy inside That was OK with me But next  me outside was a big red steel box with a padlock on it which was the tip boxAnd they would open the tip box at the end of the day and distribute it among themselves and not give me anything I saw that happening for a few days and went  the boss and complained I was probably a little mouthy and he fired me So I walked down the street  a Gulf gas station and got a job there and I worked there for five years evenings and weekendsI also worked as an orderly in a hospital in my teens and saw things and was allowed  do things that no orderly would ever be allowed  do now like take dead people  the morgue  myself in an elevar Then I worked on a fishing boat in New JerseyTell me about your parentsMy mother had been a schoolteacher early in her life but she was quite ill when I was a child During that time my father and I did the cooking particularly when my brother and sisters grew up and moved outMy father ran the largest mental health center in the Philadelphia area at that time That was an interesting window in the world He ld enough sries about things that he had seen and I saw enough myself working in the gas station and as an orderly that I certainly saw the darker and sadder side of human beingsHow did that shape youI got this from my father He was open  and accepting of a great variety of people and peoples attitudes The only thing he was inlerant of was inlerance and people who didnt treat other people wellAny other influences from your fatherMy father was a curious person and always wanted  know why something was the case and that is why I studied physics and hisry Physics helps you understand how things work and hisry helps you understand why things are the way they are Its important  feel like you have that mastery so you know and can understand everything in your circumstanceWhen I deal with a foreign country or a wartime situation I make sure I know enough of how it came  be the way it is I was also the chief technologist and acquisition officer a couple of jobs ago in the Department of Defense and I know how everything works in that areaIt means that nothing is a mystery  me and thats an important strength I have in dealing with complicated circumstances particularly foreign policy onesYouve studied hisry youve interacted with leaders around the world and worked with and for many presidents What do you think are the most important qualities of effective leadersNo 1 and particularly in the national security area is order and discipline at the p People want a sense of direction You need  be clear and in the military clarity of direction is especially important You have  be absolutely consistent and relentlessly repeat itThe other is how you conduct yourself As secretary of defense our three million uniformed and civilian employees are looking at me If they dont see an example in my commitment  the mission and the way I conduct myself it will be hard for them  follow me as a leaderClarity is important but if you have clarity without example youre just the boss barking at the p and people are reluctantly doing what theyre doing or not doing it at allIf you are very likable and they know your heart is in it but youre not decisive and crystal clear about what you expect them  do you wont succeed either So its clarity and its example every dayHow do you hireIntegrity is extremely important  me So in the interview Im watching for evasiveness for not answering the question Its important that someone be straight with you and if theyre not being straight you cant really gauge them and that tells you a great dealSomebody who is evading you in the interview is also someone who probably evades issues evades other circumstances and will not be straight with the people you put him or her in charge ofAnd how do you find that outYou ask them questions that are difficult ones of judgment in the area in which you expect  give them responsibility I dont expect them  always have a good or fully informed answer but I expect a straight answer and you can tell that right awayIn the profession of arms when youre dealing with life and death and with our national security integrity is extremely important and straightforwardness is extremely importantWhat else do you askThe other one is Why are you doing this They need  have a sense of mission and thats important because what we do is not a game Its a deadly serious business and I need someone who understands why they have chosen  do this and that theyre not just trying  be successful get ahead or get in the newspapersIt doesnt have  be a catchy answer It doesnt have  be a complicated answer It can even be a banal answer But if it is straightforward and it suggests selfawareness and a real dedication  our mission thats a good answerCollapse,business
It would seem unlikely that a single state legislative seat in Westchester County could hold the key  Democrats scoring a government trifecta in Albany an alignment in which one party controls the governorship as well as both houses of the LegislatureBut some political experts say the 37th Senate District may be that pivotalNow Mr Latimers former Senate seat is up for grabs and the special election  replace him has once again assumed heightened implicationsWhile the Assembly has an overwhelming Democratic majority the Senate is controlled  Republicans thanks  a powersharing arrangement between Republicans and several DemocratsThe Bronx seat should be a slam dunk for Democrats but political pundits say the Westchester seat  long held  Democrats  is less certain In 2012 Senate Republicans redrew the district map Doug Colety chairman of the Westchester Republican County Committee said The district is much better for Republicans than it was in the pastDemocrats have a different view Its a marvel of modern technology how gerrymandered you can make the New York Senate map said Evan Stavisky a partner in the Parkside Group a political consulting firm that represents the Senate Democratic Campaign CommitteeSo far three candidates have stepped forward  run for the Westchester Senate seat which covers diverse cities like Yonkers  the south affluent suburbs like Larchmont and more rural wns like BedfordThe countys Republican Party meanwhile has yet  name a candidate Mr Colety said that he hoped  nominate someone in early February Neither of the two declared Republicans  Daniel Schorr and Sarmad Khojasteh  have held office a fact that Ms Mayer 64 seized on Ive been in the world of Albany and I say it in a positive way because I know how  get things done she saidA longtime resident of White Plains Mr Schorr 44 said his experience would help him ferret out corruption in Albany I think our state is greatly overtaxed and corruption is part of that said Mr Schorr a graduate of Harvard Law School Every month for the next six months there is a major corruption trial occurring in New York StateAmong his ideas are 529style savings plans for small businesses and tax breaks for invesrs who finance startups If there is a dishwasher or mechanic or carpenter who wants  be a firsttime small business owner he said we can promote policies  allow them  become the restaurateur the body shop owner the contracrWere Ms Mayer  prevail in a special election there are a number of potential complications with the plan for Democratic reunification there is a provision for example that allows each side  approve the others deputiesAnd even if the two Democratic factions successfully merged it would technically still leave the party shy of a 32seat majority because of Simcha Felder a Brooklyn Democrat He is not part of the Independent Democratic Conference but has nonetheless caucused with Republicans since his election in 2012 saying it favors his constituentsAfter the deal was announced last fall Mr Felder said he could be persuaded  join Democrats or stay with Republicans if either side embraces a plan  put armed guards at every New York City schoolMeanwhile Republicans in the Senate seem unlikely  cede control without a struggle Last fall they suggested that they could retain power through 2018 citing rules they say would prevent a change in leadership without a 38seat majorityMike Murphy a spokesman for Senar Andrea StewartCousins the leader of the mainline Democratic coalition scoffed at the notion The chamber is made up of 63 members and clearly 32 members is a majority he said I would hope that the Republicans would not subvert democracy  denying the fundamental principle of majority ruleCollapse,business
Common SenseTheres a great sense of frustration here John Engler the groups president and a former Republican governor of Michigan ld me this week Were now faced with two candidates who when it comes  the United States economy have diametrically opposite viewpoints from us Its cause for great concernThat a Democratic candidate might diverge from the groups probusiness agenda is no surprise but Mr Trumps embrace of economic policies that are anathema  its members is seen as a betrayal of bedrock Republican principlesWere just on the opposite side of Trump on trade and immigration Mr Engler said Everything has been upendedIf anything Mrs Clinn seems more closely aligned with the business group than Mr Trump Although she now opposes the TransPacific Partnership trade deal she supported as secretary of state Fundamentally she and her husband come from a free trade perspective said Gregory Mankiw professor of economics at Harvard and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W Bush Its hard  believe in her heart of hearts shes opposed  free trade And in general shes more aligned with mainstream economic thoughtIts surprising  me that Trump doesnt know many of our members and they dont know him Mr Engler said Romney knew almost everyoneMr Trump and his campaign staff did not respond  requests for commentAlthough not going quite as far as Mr Trump in repudiating existing free trade deals the Republican Party largely embraced his protectionist philosophy this week declaring in its draft party platform that all trade deals should put America first In sharp contrast the Business Roundtable says on its website Open markets for international trade and investment are essential for supporting US economic growth and jobsThe business groups support for free trade has widespread bipartisan support among economists Mr Trumps positions show a complete lack of understanding of international trade said Alan S Blinder a professor of economics at Princen a former economics adviser  President Clinn and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Throwing up barriers doesnt work It will raise the exchange rate which will hurt exports and push the deficit up Barriers may help a favored few but at the expense of everyone elseProfessor Mankiw agreed There are few things economists are unanimous about but support of free trade comes pretty close There are good reasons for international specialization and  and large Americans have benefited tremendously Do we really want  produce Tshirts here and pay 60 for something that now costs 15He acknowledged Technological progress has displaced many manufacturing jobs That raises productivity which is the main driver of a better standard of living But economic change is rarely good for everyone In the short term workers lose their jobs and thats hard There are winners and losers and Trump is tapping in the losersIt makes no sense  bring the best students  our graduate schools and then force them  go home Mr Engler added We dont do that with athletes We get the best in the world We should be doing that for engineersThe xenophobia of Trump supporters isnt really economic Professor Mankiw said Its cultural They dont want people here speaking foreign languagesAlthough no one including the Roundtable supports illegal immigration many economists fear the potential economic disruption of deporting millions of people Where are you going  find the millions of workers  replace these people Professor Blinder asked And thats without even uching on the humanitarian aspectsProbably no issue has more closely united business interests and Republicans over the years than tax policy although even most Democrats and the Obama administration agree that it is in urgent need of changeThe Roundtable says America needs a modern tax system Key components of business tax reform include setting the corporate tax rate at 25 percent adopting a modern international tax system and making US tax policy permanentMr Trump goes further He would lower the corporate tax rate now 35 percent the highest in the developed world  a flat 15 percent while cutting corporate loopholesWe proposed 25 percent because we felt we had  suggest something fiscally sustainable Mr Engler said We thought we made a reasonable proposal that could thread a bipartisan needle You can get  25 percent without blowing a hole in the budgetMr Trump will no doubt get an earful if he accepts the business groups pending invitation  meet in an offtherecord session in September The group has invited Mrs Clinn as well Neither candidate has accepted but both have said that they are interested according  Mr EnglerIndeed Mr Trump could have had Roundtable members in mind when he lumped gether powerful corporations media elites and political dynasties as the people who rigged the system as he put it in a speech this monthI want you  imagine how much better our future can be if we declare independence from the elites whove led us  one financial and foreign policy disaster after another he ld cheering supportersCollapse,business
Off the ShelfIt is easy  forget personal investing fundamentals when sck prices hit new highs one week fall sharply the next and then rise again in no reliable pattern as they have been doing this year So now is an ideal time  reread  or perhaps pick up for the first time  three excellent books  people who are particularly good at explaining the building blocks of a solid portfolioIn the first of these Andrew Tobias promises in his title that he is offering The Only Investment Guide Youll Ever Need 1595 Mariner Books And in the book which has been continually updated since it was published in 1978 he covers a great deal of important terriry although some of the advice  now may sound familiar He includes nostrums like this Buy only investments you understand If the projected return sounds o good  be true stay away Youre going  have  take some risk and buy scks  stay ahead of inflation Never forget the impact taxes can have on returnsSolid counsel but it is not why the book is worth reading Mr Tobiass ideas about saving money  you cant build a portfolio without savings  are his real gems And the reason for that is his approach He combines humor  it starts with the dedication  my broker  even if he has from time  time made me just that  with common sense presented in an uncommon wayFor example you may already know that you shouldnt carry credit card debt because the interest rates can drain what you are able  sock away you can lower your insurance premiums  increasing deductibles allowing you  save more and buy in bulk when items you consume frequently are on saleBut when Mr Tobias explains it doing things like this seem as if they would be financial brilliance on your part instead of drudgeryWhy put 1000 in the sck of some utility and earn 40 in annual taxable dividends if you can put the same money in insulation and save 350  taxfree  on your utility bill he asksBut what should you do if you actually save money  following Mr Tobiass suggestions John C Bogle has some good ideas in The Little Book of Common Sense Investing Wiley 2495Lets get the negatives out of the way first Mr Bogle can be hecring You ignore these rules at your peril And perhaps because it was published a decade ago the idea of owning international scks or bonds gets little attentionThat said in clear convincing fashion he lays out a solid strategy for getting your fair share of sck market returns That isnt difficult he writes Successful investing is all about common senseAmong his commonsense ideas Since timing the market is virtually impossible you should buy and hold scks Being diversified minimizes risk Because transaction costs and brokerage fees can eat up a significant portion of your returns invest heavily through lowcost index fundsThat last isnt surprising since Mr Bogle is founder and former chief executive of Vanguard the mutual fund company known for its index funds But he argues everyone should be a fan of the fundsSimple arithmetic suggests and hisry confirms the winning strategy is  own all the nations publicly held businesses at very low cost he writes By doing so you are guaranteed  capture almost the entire return they generate in the form of dividends and earnings growth The best way  implement this strategy is indeed simple buying a fund that holds this market portfolio Such a fund is called an index fundOf course one reason most of us try  create a solid portfolio is so we can live the kind of life we want when we get older The final book grabs me partly because of my age And as I wrote two years ago I found two things appealing about The Charles Schwab Guide  Finances After FiftyCrown Business 26 written  Carrie SchwabPomerantzFirst Ms SchwabPomerantz thoroughly answers her target markets most common questions For example if you are 50 and older dont have much money stashed for retirement and wonder what you should do she says start saving at least 40 percent of your income immediatelyConversely if you are in good financial shape as retirement looms you may wonder whether you should pay off your mortgage Ms SchwabPomerantz a certified financial planner shows you how  do the arithmetic  decide You multiply your current mortgage interest rate  say 4 percent   your tax bracket Lets assume 30 percent That means your mortgage is only costing you 28 percent since you get  deduct the interest you paySo paying it off is equivalent  a 28 percent riskfree return If you are pleased with that especially since you know you will own your house free and clear pay off your mortgage If you think you can earn more elsewhere keep paying the loan and invest the money you would have used  pay off the mortgageThe other nice thing is that Ms SchwabPomerantz  the daughter of Charles Schwab the founder of the mutual fund company that bears his name  treats her readers like adults who know the personal finance basicsFor example she says when it comes  retirement planning you need  answer only three questions What do you expect  spend each year in retirement How much money will you need in savingsinvestments  support that spending And how much more do you need  save  get from here where you are now  there the point where you can fund the retirement you wantIf your projections show you coming up short she says you should postpone retirement That would allow you  build a bigger retirement portfolio and shorten the time youll rely on savings she says and it could also increase your Social Security benefitsThese three books are at the p of my list If I expanded it I would include The Intelligent Invesr  Benjamin Graham Collins Business Essentials 8 Scks for the Long Run  Jeremy J Siegel McGrawHill 40 and Making the Most of Your Money Now  Jane Bryant Quinn Simon  Schuster 35They o are worth a second read or a first if you havent had the pleasureCollapse,business

The president also continues  insist that he could decide  renominate the Feds chairwoman Janet L Yellen whose fouryear term ends in FebruaryOn Friday the president ok  Instagram  advertise that he would announce his pick next week People are anxiously awaiting my decision as  who the next head of the Fed will be Mr Trump said in a video It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job And I have somebody very specific in mind I think everybody will be very impressedThe choice of a Fed chairman is always a highstakes political decision but Mr Trumps predecessors uniformly sought  minimize the attendant drama Past presidents have rarely acknowledged the existence of multiple candidates and since World War II every chairman who completed a first term has been nominated for a second termMr Trump  contrast announced in July that he was considering candidates  replace Ms Yellen The White House later confirmed the names of five finalists and then Mr Trump said publicly he had narrowed his focus  Mr Powell and Mr TaylorOn Tuesday he conducted an informal poll of Senate Republicans asking them  raise a hand for either Mr Powell or Mr Taylor Some refusedI dont think thats a very good way  pick a Fed chair so I declined  participate said Senar Bob Corker of Tennessee an increasingly outspoken critic of Mr Trumps style of governanceOn Wednesday Mr Trump sought advice from a TV personality turning the tables on Lou Dobbs of Fox Business Network in the middle of an interviewTell me who your preference is Mr Trump said He pressed repeatedly for an answer from the visibly flustered host Mr Dobbs finally endorsed Ms YellenMr Trump responded She was very impressive I liked her a lot I mean its somebody that I am thinking about But he continued I have  say youd like  make your own mark suggesting that he might be inclined  nominate someone elseSarah Binder a professor of political science at George Washingn University said the most unusual aspect of Mr Trumps deliberations was the diversity of the candidatesPresidents generally decide what kind of chairman they want and then pick a nomineePresident Jimmy Carter who chose twice first decided that he wanted an industrial executive settling on G William Miller the head of Textron Nearly 17 months later deciding he wanted someone respected  financial markets Mr Carter picked Paul VolckerPresident Ronald Reagan renominated Mr Volcker then chose Alan Greenspan draining the drama from the process for almost two decades In 2003 President George W Bush offered Mr Greenspan a fifth term a year before the end of his fourth termWhen Mr Greenspan retired in 2006 Mr Bush chose Ben S Bernanke from a list of three Ivy League economists who had served as Republican policy advisersIf youre taking seriously reappointing Yellen or nominating Powell well thats lightyears away from Taylor Ms Binder said It just raises the question What is the basis on which the president is conducting the searchOne possible explanation is that Mr Trump is struggling with the imperatives of a polarized political environment He has repeatedly praised Ms Yellen for her performance as Fed chairwoman The economy is growing and the sck market is rising and Mr Trump wants both trends  continue But conservatives are pressing Mr Trump  seize the opportunity  shift the approach of the central bank  appointing Mr TaylorThree House Republicans including Representative Warren Davidson of Ohio sent a letter  Mr Trump on Wednesday pressing for new leadership at the Fed Republicans want  constrain the Feds conduct of monetary policy and  install a Fed chairman who is supportive of efforts  reduce financial regulationSome of Mr Trumps advisers including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin favor the nomination of Mr Powell as a kind of middle road a Republican likely  maintain the Feds course on monetary policy but with greater sympathy for relaxing financial regulationMs Binder said that replacing Ms Yellen would reinforce the growing tendency  view the Fed as a partisan political institution with every president picking a new chairmanIf anything is being broken here its the norm of bipartisan continuity at the Fed and it is always  the Feds benefit  look bipartisan and  be bipartisan she said It raises fewer questions about what is motivating the Feds choice of monetary policyBut Peter ContiBrown a legal studies professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is writing a political hisry of the Fed said that Mr Trump was simply making explicit the longstanding reality that presidents seek  influence the course of monetary policyIndeed Mr ContiBrown said he saw a silver lining in Mr Trumps showmanship and in the diversity of the candidates because it was providing a rare opportunity for the public  compare and debate different views of the Feds role in the economyI think its all  the very good  generate discussion about what the Fed is what the different approaches are whether theyre good or bad he said This is the only time the public gets  weigh in If you dont think the Fed should operate in the shadowy corners of the administrative state this is exactly what accountability

Common SenseTwo weeks ago my smartphone shut down because of a low battery as I was about  board a flight  Europe That seemed odd given that I had barely used it that day I plugged it in on the plane but seven hours later it still wasnt functioning When I arrived at my hotel I tried a different charger  no avail The phone was dead  terminally so it turned outI hadnt brought a lapp so I had no access  the internet or email I had no camera no guidebooks no mapsFor the next 10 days I lived without my phone or any other connection  the digital world There were indeed many compensations But it was hard  shake a freefloating anxiety that some disaster loomed How would I retrieve my return flight reservations from a nonworking cellphoneLately the big internet companies have come under a barrage of criticism for invading privacy carrying fake news spreading hate messages and selling ads against them and undermining American democracy What I learned is that for better or worse they have already so changed the world that life without them is all but impossible outside a monasteryRoad maps a mainstay of my precellphone trips  Europe were nowhere  be found nor were the booksres that used  sell them The rental car agency in Milan offered a guide for getting out of the airport but that was about it Everyone assumes you have access  ogle MapsOnce youre off the major highways Italian roads are a spider web connected  roundabouts bristling with signs pointing  the nearest tiny villages but lacking any route numbersThe triedandtrue method of asking for directions prompted some human interaction and gave my traveling companion the opportunity  practice his Italian But it was a reminder that human beings are often unreliable The rental car agent in Milan gave us directions  Siena via Genoa a route we later learned that added about two hours  the tripTrying  find a house in the Tuscan countryside  asking passers was futile No one in rural Italy seems  use street addresses which in any event dont correspond in any rational way  actual streetsLiving in the moment isnt so great when youre lostWhile I had no phone of my own others with me had theirs and I had  rely on them on several occasions starting with simply finding our house We had  call the housekeeper for directions three timesAfter that I relied on borrowed phones and we used ogle Maps for navigationI shared my experience this week with Adam Alter an associate professor at New York Universitys Stern School of Business and author of Irresistible The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us HookedOne problem for people who choose  be without phones is as you found that people expect you  have one and infrastructure is designed with the knowledge that almost everyone does Mr Alter said Youre borderline forced  carry one for basic utility even if youd prefer not Without access  texts or email I couldnt see or respond  any messages no matter how important I waited three days before breaking down and again borrowing a cellphone  check email But  gain access  my email from an unfamiliar device required a code sent via text   where else  my dead cellphoneOnce I gave that up I was fine perhaps because I didnt feel any guilt  it wasnt my fault the phone failed and I couldnt check messages For others this may be difficult Mr Alters book reports that checking emails has become a widespread addictionAt first I missed my phones camera feature I was on holiday in a beautiful country after all But after a few days I spped thinking about documenting the trip and simply enjoyed itWithout internet access I had no access  travel mainstays like TripAdvisor or OpenTable But there were some old guidebooks at the house where we stayed and major hisric sites urist attractions and even restaurants dont change much in a place like ItalyI found its not hard  sniff out a promising restaurant that appeals  your personal taste as opposed  crowdsourced recommendations We made some wonderful discoveries And afterward there were no emails asking me  review the experience and provide sites like TripAdvisor with free edirial copyMr Alter pointed out that this sort of serendipity is often the route  novel exciting tripmaking experiencesHe added Phones overschedule and over regiment our lives which robs us of these opportunitiesI quickly grew accusmed  having no news sck market quotes or weather forecasts Id never want  live permanently without them but checking out for 10 days was therapeuticI read nothing about Donald TrumpStill I broke down midweek when the housekeeper asked me what I knew about Harvey Weinstein The accusations of the movie producers serial sexual misconduct had broken the day after I left and were now blanketing Italian media I knew nothing So I borrowed a phone and read The New York Times account and then The New Yorker piece that followed Both were riveting but interfered with what had until then been blissfully untroubled sleepAfter returning the rental car in Milan I realized that no phone meant no Uber app That meant we did a lot of walking in what turns out  be a fascinating city And my anxieties about my return trip proved unfounded I skipped the checkin kiosks at the airport went  the checkin counter and got an oldfashioned paper boarding pass with minimum fussId never leave home without a working smartphone again But denied access  the internet I had time  read several books I focused more on the people with me and the beauty of my surroundings I was more open  unplanned experiences I had time for selfreflection Id like  think that on future trips Id use the phone only when essentialIt turns out theres an app  help people do thatRecently I spent two weeks in a place without cellphone coverage and had a similar experience  you Mr Holesh ld me It was really inconvenient not  have Maps but refreshing  not constantly be worrying about whats going onIt was literally the longest stretch of time Ive not accessed the internet in 15 years he continued The first few days were ugh but after that I got used  the lack of connectivity and loved

Common SenseSome ok  Twitter  suggest new advertising slogans for United If we cant beat out competirs well beat our cusmers was one United Airlines putting the hospital in hospitality was anotherTheyll be studying this in business schools for years said Andrew Winsn a corporate strategy consultant and author of The Big Pivot and a recent article in Harvard Business Review about the United incidentHaving recently completed a round trip from Newark  San Francisco on United I wasnt all that surprised that United appeared  be weathering the srm When I booked my ticket United offered the most convenient flight options at the cheapest fares albeit just 12 or so less than American So I booked on United even though the Dao incident was fresh in my mindMy experience bears out an adage about airlines People almost always opt for convenience and price even while complaining loudly about crowded planes and a dearth of amenities And now that there are just four major carriers in the United States thanks  years of industry consolidation many passengers dont have all that much choiceThe barriers  cusmer movement are pretty high Mr Winsn said Youd think that consumer perceptions matter a lot but given that the major carriers practically have a monopoly on many routes and airports its not that easy  switchThat said once on board I found the experience surprisingly pleasant The flight ok off on time and landed early The snack I wanted was still available even though I was seated ward the back My video screen malfunctioned depriving me of an opportunity  watch the movie Hidden Figures But the flight attendant was so empathetic and tried repeatedly  fix the problem rebooting the aircrafts entire entertainment system several times that I ended up reassuring her that I was happy  read a book She gave me a voucher worth 5000 frequentflier miles or a 100 credit on a future flight which seemed pretty generous for a minor incidentThe return trip was even better The plane was a mint condition Boeing 777300ER with an intriguing businessclass layout I admired while on my way  coach Back there the seats were leather and unusually comfortable even for someone as tall as I am The video equipment worked I was surprised when a flight attendant offered me a complimentary meal I ld her it must be a mistake since I was in an ordinary coach seatA United spokeswoman ld me the airline had begun serving complimentary meals and drinks on many transcontinental flights beginning July 1 but only for Economy Plus passengers She speculated that there may have been some extra meals on my flight or I may have been upgraded  an Economy Plus seat without my realizing it And she said the plane was probably one of the airlines 11 new 777300ERs which are being broken in on transcontinental routes before moving  international onesThat flight also ok off on time and landed early United said it had the best ontime arrival and departure performance of any carrier in the second quarterMaybe this simply reflects diminished expectations but after the remarkably stressfree flight I wondered if it might be a good idea  fly an airline soon after an embarrassing episode like the Dao incident on the theory that everyone will be on their best behaviorAccording  United my experience wasnt an anomaly since the airline has put in a host of recent postDao changes aimed at cusmer satisfaction To say we learned some lessons would be putting it mildly said Megan McCarthy the United spokeswomanBesides the free meals and drinks in Economy Plus United is now offering up  10000 in compensation for passengers who give up their seats on overbooked flights These issues will be resolved before boarding so no one gets dragged off after taking an assigned seat United said involuntary denied boardings had dropped 88 percent in June from a year earlier When the airline loses luggage cusmers will no longer have  provide receipts  prove the value of what was in it The airline will provide up  1500 in compensation no questions askedUnited has also set up a team based in Chicago  offer creative solutions  cusmer problems Ms McCarthy cited an example of providing a flight  a near airport and ground transportation  their destination if someone has been denied boarding on an overbooked flightThat was the right thing  do said Steve Barrett edir of PRWeek magazine They should have done it immediately United made it a much bigger sry than it ever would have beenWhen I spoke  Mr Barrett this week he acknowledged that no boycott had materialized and Uniteds bookings were holding up helped in part  a series of incidents at rival airlines suggesting that United wasnt any worseStill United has suffered considerable reputational damage Mr Barrett said No one is going  forget that video anytime soonUnited is tying executive pay not just Mr Munozs  cusmer satisfaction and in its recent earnings report included a section on the cusmer experience The airline said it would continue its renewed focus on the cusmerThats great and I hope its true Mr Winsn said The airlines have spent the last 30  40 years building a culture thats about maximizing profits Employees and cusmers were just a cog in that strategic wheel Maybe it takes an incident like this  make them realize they can be about something more than moving cattle in the cheapest possible wayCollapse,business
Common SenseIn a period of otherwise extended market calm geopolitics have been driving periodic bouts of volatility Even small invesrs have been making bets on the impact politics can have on scks and other asset classes After last weeks selloff I got a wave of questions from people asking whether Mr Trump might be impeached and if they should sell scksI obviously cant answer the first question As for selling scks my answer as it has been consistently since the election is no at least not because of the troubles swirling around the presidentConsider what has happened in the days since the headlinemaking news By the middle of this week the Standard  Poors 500sck index had recovered virtually everything it lost after the TrumpRussia news broke and on Thursday it closed at a new highBrazils Bovespa index regained much of the ground it lost last week and was in positive terriry for the year  dateWithin a month of Brexit European scks had recovered nearly all their losses This year European sck markets have been notching new highsEven some of Wall Streets most famous and successful invesrs have been struggling this year  turn political upheaval in market gains Paulson  Company and Soros Fund Management two of the bestknown global macro hedge funds which make bets on geopolitical events lost billions last year according  an annual hedge fund ranking compiled  LCH Investments Paul Tudor Joness Tudor Investment another macro fund was flat and Mr Jones recently ld invesrs hes taking on more risk and shifting  more quantitative strategies in an effort  enhance performanceA macro hedge fund index compiled  Hedge Fund Research is down nearly 1 percent since Jan 1 and over 4 percent for the last 12 months one of the worst performing hedge fund indexes Meanwhile the SP 500 gained almost 10 percent in 2016 and is up more than 7 percent this yearBy and large invesrs should tune out political events said James B Stack president of InvesTech Research and Stack Financial Management who has done a study of what he calls crisis events and their effect on markets Hisrically speaking and as a seasoned invesr Id say invesrs should just ignore geopolitical events like Brexit or whatever is happening in BrazilThe problem Mr Stacks research has found is that geopolitical events may be widely feared and there will often be a kneejerk market reaction when theyre unexpected but seldom do they have a lasting impact Underlying economic trends and monetary policy are far more importantMarkus Schomer chief economist at the asset manager PineBridge Investments made a similar point As fundamental invesrs with longer time horizons we try not  be distracted  the political noise he said Ive been telling even our traders with shorter time horizons that what were seeing doesnt really affect the economy or monetary policy which is more important for markets than anything elseMr Stack noted that scks declined sharply after the terrorist attacks of Sept 11 2001 But the bear market and recession that followed the technology bubble that exploded in 2000 were already well underway  then September 2001 turned out  be an unusually bad time  sell scks By New Years Day 2002 little more than three months after the post911 low reached on Sept 21 the SP 500 had gained close  20 percentA more recent example was the showdown over the federal debt ceiling in 2011 when Standard  Poors downgraded United States government securities for the first time amid fears the government might default on its debt Scks dropped 15 percent in less than two months and we were on the brink of a bear market Mr Stack said Once the crisis was resolved scks came roaring back and had regained all their losses  yearendOf 11 major geopolitical events examined  Mr Stacks firm only two  the Nazi invasion of France in May 1940 and Japans bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941  led  market losses over oneweek threemonth and oneyear periods and in the case of Pearl Harbor the oneyear decline was less than 1 percentPresident John F Kennedys assassination had no discernible impact Scks were up more than 20 percent a year laterAs geopolitical crises go those were pretty big shocks  markets and invesr psychology So far nothing in the Trump administration has come close Still expectations that Mr Trump and a Republican Congress would succeed in enacting business and shareholderfriendly tax and regulary changes are part of what has driven recent market gainsMr Stack noted that measures of confidence among small businesses chief executives and consumers are at or near record levels Theres no doubt that expectations have accelerated since the election he said So the question is whether political turmoil will turn those expectations upside down leading  a loss of confidence and lower consumer spending That could happen but so far were not seeing any evidence of that he saidHe said comparisons  the Watergateera bear market of 197374 were off base because then the country was in recession the Arab oil crisis sent gasoline prices surging inflation was raging and interest rates hit record highs Arguably President Richard M Nixons abandonment of the gold standard and the transition  marketdetermined currency exchange rates had more  do with plunging sck prices than his crumbling presidencyMr Schomer said a failure  act upon many of Mr Trumps spending and tax proposals might not be such a bad thing for markets given that the United States economy is already at or close  full employment and doesnt need additional stimulus At the end of the day the only reason well have a recession is if the Fed is forced  raise interest rates o quickly unless we have a massive crisis which I dont see happening he saidIf anything hisry suggests that longterm invesrs should buy scks after markets fall on bad geopolitical news not sell But thats not  say this time wont prove  be an exception or that markets wont correct for other reasonsWhatever happens with President Trump the United States is in the ninth year of the secondlongest bull market since World War II none have made it past 10 years Valuations are getting stretched Sooner or later there will be another correction and eventually a bear marketNonetheless Mr Schomer says he sees no imminent end  the bull market Were not going  see a 25 percent surge this year but this economic cycle is so slow and steady with so few imbalances we could end up with 8  10 percent gains the next few years and a much greater degree of overvaluationFor his part Mr Stack said We still believe this market will hit new highs in 2017 but the low volatility and the high valuations suggest this is not a lowrisk market Its not a market in which you should be investing large sums of new capitalCollapse,business
WheelsThrough its 114year hisry HarleyDavidson has taken on numerous contenders intent on dethroning it as the dominant American morcycle maker So far it has a perfect recordBut Harley now faces perhaps its most trying challenge in decades Polaris an established American company with manufacturing knowhow and a revered morcycle brand in Indian is quickly making big stridesPolaris surprised the industry in January when it announced that it would shut its homegrown morcycle brand Vicry and focus entirely on Indian a company it bought in 2011 So far the move seems like a smart oneIndians sales grew 17 percent in the second quarter of this year while Harleys sales shrank nearly 7 percent Overall sales for largedisplacement bikes the kind that Harley specializes in shrank 9 percent in the second quarter of this yearEven with those results Harleys grip on the overall market remains strong holding a market share that hovers around 50 percent for big bikes handily eclipsing Indians singledigit slice But the Indian surge is striking in that it counters the overall markets downward driftTo some degree the rapid rise is a result of lessons learned from 18 years of building the Vicry brand That was the school of hard knocks said Scott Wine chief executive of Polaris Industries Indians share of its segment is already higher than Vicrys wasPolaris long known for snowmobiles and offroad vehicles expanded in morcycles with the introduction of its Vicry line in 1998 Vicrys big Vtwin engines combined with layouts that favored a relaxed riding posture  what bikers classify as the cruiser genre  crib somewhat from Harleys playbook That approach attracted a devoted following but not the volume and profits needed  sustain production in a mature marketThough not apparent at the time Vicrys fate was sealed  Polariss purchase of the Indian brand in 2011 The original Indian company which opened in 1901 and failed in 1953 despite a hisry of innovation and racetrack success had been the subject of previous revival attempts But no modern owner had the industrial clout of PolarisThe rebirth started well with attractive bikes earning positive reviews from enthusiast publications and the potential for growth was greater with Indian than with VicryVicry ended 2016 up 7 percent in sales but it wasnt profitable Mr Wine said Winding it down made sense in terms of allocating capital and engineering resourcesAll Indian morcycles are built in Spirit Lake Iowa While its bikes like the Scout and the justreleased Scout Bobber are aimed at younger buyers most models revel in heritage with styling and names that hark back  the companys prewar glory days They represent as Karl Brauer of Kelley Blue Book an au research firm put it a cool theme married  a modern chassis and particularly appeal  buyers with a what have you done for me lately outlook on brand loyaltyInevitably Indians retro approach makes the brand a headhead competir for HarleyDavidson offering bikes in the uring cruiser and midsize classes as well as the popular bagger category or bikes carrying saddlebags but not the full windscreen and gear of a longdistance uring machineHisry has taught Harley that taking a waitandsee attitude  this development could be painful Even if competirs havent beaten Harley they have whittled away at its market share  most notably Japanese brands which have created model lines like the Kawasaki Vulcan and the Suzuki BoulevardMichael W Kennedy Harleys vice president and managing direcr for the United States points  the companys ambitious programs for the coming decade including introducing two million new riders  morcycling through its Riding Academy and the release of 100 new models There is also the matter of affordability Weve got nine bikes under 12000 in the United States and a Street Rod model thats 9000 Mr Kennedy said addressing a perception that HarleyDavidson products carry a big price tagRobin Farley who leads leisuremarket analysis at UBS Investment Bank said Harleys problem was not a simple matter of shifting loyalties Sales have been declining for the last three years partly because an aging rider population is shrinking Harleys core cusmer baseThe slide is not just a recent development Harleys sales were declining in 2007 before even the recession hit the industry Ms Farley said HarleyDavidson dropped more than Indian gained and new entries like the middleweight Street models have lower margins that cannot offset declines in the core businessAdding  its woes the company was fined 15 million last year for selling engine control devices that violated exhaust emissions regulations though the Trump administration in July dropped a 3 million portion of that settlement that required Harley  fund an antipollution programAnother wild card in the industry is the future of Ducati a brand that shuffled among various owners until landing in the Volkswagen corporate portfolio under Audis supervision in 2012 Despite reports that Ducati is up for sale analysts have expressed skepticism about how much it could improve the results for a new company The economics would be hard  justify as well Morcycle sales in the United States have not nearly recovered  pre2008 levels and Harley recently lowered its forecasts for 2017 salesIndians product plans call for eight new models in 2017 and Mr Wine hinted broadly about entering new market segments The companys successful dirttrack racing program  another direct challenge  Harley  may offer some clue Polaris also acquired an electric morcycle maker Brammo in 2015 but the company has said it is not yet satisfied that the bikes meet its standards for performance range and priceTo be sure there is little chance that Indian will run HarleyDavidson out of business anytime soon Harleys sales last year some 260000 morcycles worldwide generated revenue of 6 billionPolaris does not release sales volume figures but morcycles in 2016 accounted for just 16 percent of the companys 45 billion revenue Indians growth is bound  look strong at least in percentage terms given its modest baseline and that will be especially true for international marketsBut  Steve Menne president for morcycle operations at Polaris the reality of a market that has seemingly pped out means that cannibalism is unavoidableAs you go up in engine size you have  take share from your competirs Mr Menne said The corollary  one formula for growth  is then  engineer morcycles with smaller engines like the Bobber and the Scout 60 Thats where youll find the chance  bring in new riders he saidCollapse,business
Between Richard Nixons election  the silent majority in 1968 and Donald Trumps stunning vicry in 2016 there have been six conservative waves that swept Republicans in office Disaffected white voters without college degrees have been the driving force in all of themDespite their declining share of the elecrate these voters continue  exercise an outsize influence as the Silent Majority of 1968 and 1972 the Reagan Democrats of 1980 the Angry White Men of 1994 the Tea Party insurgents of 2010 and now the triumphant Trump Republicans of 2016Lets take a look at the hisry of this trendIn 1968 these white voters  often low or moderate income disproportionately male and clustered in exurban and rural areas then as now  were crucial  the birth of the modern conservative coalitionThat year famously southern whites angered  enactment of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act abandoned the Democratic Party in droves and they were soon joined  many northern whites opposed  courrdered busingThe Democratic Partys commitment  civil rights prompted millions of white voters  cast ballots either for Richard Nixon running as the Republican nominee or for George Wallace the segregationist Dixiecrat and former governor of Alabama running as the nominee of the American Independent PartyThe Republicans suddenly became the party of the white working class Teixeira wrote on his blogThe election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 further strengthened the commitment of the white working class  Republican presidential candidates especially in the NorthGingrich claimed responsibility for his partys 1994 vicries Bill Clinns initial abandonment of the themes that he campaigned on in 1992 was in fact more importantThe changed agenda proved disastrous for Democratic members of the House and SenateThe 1994 congressional debacle should be a reminder of what happens when Democrats lose uch with the lives of working people Bill Clinns election was accompanied  great hopes in the country but over the next two years those hopes turned  disappointment On the eve of the offyear elections Clinn seemed like a culturally liberal president who could not deliverGreenberg continuedThe 1994 election was a disaster produced  a downscale workingclass revolt against the Democrats Support for congressional Democrats among high school graduates dropped 12 points  only 46 percent Among white male high school graduates support for the Democrats fell off a cliff careening 20 points downward from 57 percent  37 percentFor many analysts and Democratic operatives Obamas two vicries in 2008 and 2012 marked the final collapse of the conservative coalition Even the Republican Party notably in the socalled Aupsy Report produced in 2013  Reince Priebus  soon  be Trumps chief of staff  acknowledged that a whitedominated conservative alliance was doomed  defeat unless the party opened its doors in general and  Hispanics in particularWhich brings us  2016How then is it possible that this supposedly fading constituency played such a decisive role in 2016Two reasonsTrumps voters were situated in a way that allowed them  exercise far more influence on the outcome in the Elecral College than their overall numbers would suggest allowing Trump  sweep across the Rust Belt  vicryThis apostasy among white voters has certainly not gone unnoticed and party strategists have long debated what if anything could be done  bring these voters back in the Democratic fold particularly since the landslide defeat of 1984Greenberg found that for these voters Blacks constitute the explanation of their vulnerability and for almost everything that has gone wrong in their livesThisspecial status of blacks is perceived  almost all of these individuals as a serious obstacle  their personal advancement Indeed discrimination against whites has become a wellassimilated and ready explanation for their status vulnerability and failuresThe CRG study was equally brutal These votershave a whole set of middleclass economic problems day and their party is not helping them Instead it is helping blacks Hispanics and the poor They feel betrayedCRG found that in the view of the white working class the Democrats are the giveaway party and giveaway means o much middle class money going  blacks and the poorIt has become increasingly clear that progressives and Democrats have no alternative except  challenge the hold that conservative and the GOP have established over white working AmericansDrutman argues thatIf Democrats define themselves as the party that is opposed  Republicans as they must they will soon find themselves as the party of fiscal responsibility as opposed  the Republicans who will again run huge deficits as the party of international responsibility as opposed  the more isolationist and nationalist Republicans and as the party of global business as opposed  the protectionist Republicans They will continue  be the party of environmentalism the stakes of this will get even greater soon and the party of diversity and leranceAt the policy level there are substantial objections  the fullscale emergence of a Democratic Party along these lines It would mean that neither party would represent the economic interests of the botm half of the income distribution  regardless of race or ethnicity  on crucial issues of tax and spending policiesThere is however growing evidence that the wheels of elecral politics have made the developments Drutman describes increasingly likelyIn 2004 those with incomes under 30000 voted Democratic  20 points in 2016 these voters voted Democratic  12 points a 40 percent declineAt the upper end voters with household incomes from 100000  200000 voted Republican in 2004  15 points In 2016 they voted Republican  one point Voters making more than 200000 in 2004 voted Republican  28 points in 2016 they also voted Republican  1 pointAs Drutman points out with a President Trump there is now a change agent  accelerate these forcesBy 2032 Teixeira writes we are far more likely  view the 2016 election as the last stand of Americas white working class dreaming of a past that no longer existsMaybeIn 2002 Teixeira and John Judis published the classic book The Emerging Democratic Majority only  see the reelection of George Bush two years later and the election of Donald Trump 14 years laterJudis whose most recent book is The Populist Explosion is less confident than Teixeira He argues that in this years election either John Kasich or Marco Rubio could have beaten Clinn but the coalition would have looked different adding in an email thatwhat I would say if someone put a gun  my head is that there is still a stalemate between the two parties in spite of Trumps and the Republicans success Trump could fail the Dems could come back and then the GOP Or Trump could thread the needle and win two terms Not clear what will happen But politically  leave aside the Census Bureau  the Dems are in disarrayWhite tribalism or ethnocentrism  whatever you want  call it  is undeniably a powerful force But so are the identities loyalties and resentments of those who have their own competing racial and ethnic commitments The American experiment which gives all these interests participary roles in a dynamic democracy has long been under strain Over the next four years it will now be openly tested The outcome may well be wrenchingCollapse,business

When the Harvard Business School was founded in 1908 the first entirely graduatelevel professional business program in the country was described  the future Harvard president Abbott Lawrence Lowell as a great but delicate experiment Today the school is indisputably great but hardly delicate It accepted just 12 percent of nearly 10000 MBA applicants in 2016 Eightynine percent of those who were accepted attended which means that Harvard remains the overwhelming first choice among graduate schools of business despite occasional rankings that put Stanford Yale or Northwestern ahead of it There are more than 76000 living Harvard MBA alumni 33 percent of whom live outside the United States forming what is very likely the most potent network of any graduate schoolThe marriage of Harvards prestige and intellectual pedigree  overtly moneymaking pursuits has yielded an institution that not only teaches the fundamentals of business education but also provides its soonbewealthy graduates with unrivaled opportunity and has become a money machine un itself as Duff McDonald puts it in his sweeping survey of the schools hisry and influenceBut how and why that might be the case isnt really what interests McDonald the author of previous books about McKinsey the consulting firm and JPMorgans chief executive Jamie Dimon In The lden Passport hes determined  call the Harvard Business School  account citing its founding doctrine which was  develop a heightened sense of responsibility among businessmen and eventually women who will handle their current business problems in socially constructive ways In that regard McDonald is scathing in his critique Harvard Business School has not only proven an enormous failure but its very success has made it positively dangerousHe drives home the point in chapter after chapter picking up steam in more recent decades Harvard he maintains provided the ideological underpinnings for the junkbondinduced takeover mania and resulting scandals of the 1980s the corporate scandals of the 2000s the egregious increase in the pay gap between chief executives and ordinary employees the real estate mortgage bubble and ensuing financial crisis even the election of Donald Trump In McDonalds view the school has contributed  pretty much every bad thing that has happened in American business and the economy in the last century In the wake of whatever scandal or financial collapse or recession  which it has contributed it wipes its hands distances itself and still has the nerve  put forth its experts as the solution  problemsIn virtually every instance McDonald contends Harvard has obsessively pursued money sending a disproportionate number of its graduates  consulting firms beginning in the 1950s it was all but synonymous with McKinsey  Wall Street in the 1980s and  entrepreneurial startups once initial public offerings became the rage in the 1990s  and provided intellectual justifications for its actions Much of that wealth found its way back  the school itself Its professors earn enormous sums as consultants  businesses populated  their former students who also give generously  their alma mater Its endowment sod at 33 billion  2015 a dedicated portion of the universitys enormous 327 billionMcDonalds criticism of Michael Jensen now an emeritus professor is especially withering As he sees it Jensen bears major responsibility for the rapacious hostile takeovers and the obsession with sck prices and shortterm results that led  the Enron and WorldCom scandals as well as for the emergence of outlandishly high chief executive payJensen came  the business school in 1984 just as the junkbondfueled takeover boom was gaining steam and he became a fulltime faculty member in 1989 Undeniably one of the most influential business theorists of modern times he advocated an agency theory of management in which managements sole duty was  maximize shareholder value This upended the longheld stakeholder model in which management was seen as having broader obligations  a corporations workers cusmers and communitiesJensens theories had simplicity and consistency If all that matters is shareholder value then hostile takeovers leveraged buyouts and other forms of financial engineering are fine as long as they boost share prices no matter that battalions of workers have  be fired and community relations damaged Jensen also championed sharebased executive compensation on the grounds that no matter how much executives were paid shareholders benefited This was an idea that swept corporate America

damage has been done An obsession with sck prices and shortterm results was the motive for many of the accounting scandals of the 2000s which were designed  prop up share prices and as a result high executive pay Even Jensen eventually had  concede that the liberal use of sck options as executive compensation had become managerial heroinJensen is just one of many examples of the insidious relationship between Harvard Business School theory and realworld calamities in The lden Passport but it seems worth asking Is McDonalds broadside fair Apart from a few brief quotations from his published work we dont hear from Jensen himself or any of the other stillliving culprits McDonald identifies Its hard  fault McDonald who reports that Harvard Business School shut me out entirely when he sought cooperation and pretty much shut down everyone who works there That seems a shame McDonald insists he isnt antibusinessschool he attended Wharn nor is he antiwealth Nonetheless he says he found the rejection liberatingBut I missed a greater sense of balance It doesnt seem fair  take one major example  blame Harvard for the recent financial crisis While their actions remain a subject of spirited debate the HBS graduates assembled  McDonald  starting with former President George W Bush former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former SEC Chairman Chrispher Cox  are credited  many with mitigating the damage and saving the country from an even worse catastrophe To take just one counterexample the young former ldman Sachs investment banker Fabrice Tourre one of the few Wall Street figures actually found guilty of civil fraud for his role in the kind of complex mortgage deals that contributed  the crisis is a graduate of Frances cole Centrale and Stanford University Frances prestigious Grandes coles  not HBS  appear  have generated a disproportionate number of the financial engineers who unwittingly helped cause the crisis Given the large number of Harvard Business grads in highranking executive positions its inevitable that many would be ensnared in what turned in a global catastrophe Its a shame that some of them didnt see the looming disaster and sound an alarm But hardly anyone did including graduates of every other business schoolMcDonald bookends his long and impressively researched account with a portrait of Casey Gerald an AfricanAmerican who delivered a 2014 Class Day speech thats been viewed online over 200000 times and is featured on the schools Making a Difference website Gerald turned his back on a lucrative career in private equity  cofound a public interest organization  connect MBA graduates with missiondriven businesses This may suggest  some that it is hard  generalize about Harvards students though McDonald isnt spped He sees Gerald as one of a handful of outliers the exception that proves the rule that most graduates are morally detached singleminded fortune seekersI suspect McDonald wont be invited  campus anytime soon but perhaps he should be Agree with him or not he deserves credit for raising questions that every business school needs  be asking Its hard  quarrel with his concluding plea HBS should  and can  play a part in helping more people who think about business rediscover a purpose other than profit As he puts it It needs  graduate more people who are motivated  solve problems and fewer people who create themJames B Stewart writes Common Sense a weekly business column for The Times and is the author of nine books including Den of Thieves and DisneyWarWe earn an affiliate commission

As President Trump heads in one of the most critical phases of the special counsels investigation his personal legal team has shrunk  essentially just one member and he is struggling  find any p lawyers willing  represent himWorking for a president is usually seen as a dream job But leading lawyers in Washingn and New York have repeatedly spurned overtures  take over the defense of Mr Trump a mercurial client who often ignores his advisers guidance In some cases lawyers firms have blocked any talks fearing a backlash that would hurt businessThe president lost two lawyers in just the past four days including one who had been on board for less than a weekJoseph diGenova a longtime Washingn lawyer who has pushed theories on Fox News that the FBI made up evidence against Mr Trump left the team on Sunday He had been hired last Monday three days before the head of the presidents personal legal team John Dowd quit after determining that the president was not listening  his advice Mr Trump had also considered hiring Mr diGenovas wife Vicria Toensing but she will also not join the teamThat leaves the president with just one personal lawyer who is working full time on the special counsels investigation as Mr Trump is facing one of the most significant decisions related  it whether  sit for an interviewThat lawyer Jay Sekulow is a conservative commentar who made his name on religious freedom cases Mr Sekulow is in talks with other lawyers about joining the team although it is not clear how far those discussions have progressedHours before the announcement of Mr diGenovas departure which Mr Sekulow said was related  a conflict of interest the president ok  Twitter  reject any suggestion that lawyers do not want  work for himMany lawyers and p law firms want  represent me in the Russia case  dont believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard  find a lawyer who wants  take this on he wrote Fame  fortune will NEVER be turned down  a lawyer though some are conflictedAdding new lawyers he said would be costly because they would take months  get up  speed if for no other reason than they can bill moreI am very happy with my existing team he addedThis month the president met with the veteran lawyer Emmet Flood about the possibility of joining the legal team But Mr Trump was put off  the fact that Mr Flood a Republican had represented Bill Clinn during his impeachment process and Mr Flood has made clear that he will not represent the president if Marc E Kasowitz his brash longtime personal lawyer has any role in the effortMr Trump also tried  recruit Theodore B Olson a wellknown Republican lawyer but Mr Olson has said he would not be representing the presidentThe first phase of legal work for Mr Trump in the inquiry  the special counsel Robert S Mueller III was led  a White House lawyer Ty Cobb That work which in part involved the production of documents and the arrangement of interviews with White House officials has been largely completedThe second phase which is now focused on the question of a presidential interview with Mr Mueller had been led  Mr Dowd One reason Mr Dowd quit was that against his advice Mr Trump was insistent that he wanted  answer questions under oath from Mr Mueller believing that it would help clear himMr Dowd had concluded that there was no upside and that the president who often does not tell the truth could increase his legal exposure if his answers were not accurateRoger Cossack a seasoned legal analyst said the key  successfully defending a highprofile client under immense scrutiny was  have a cohesive legal team with a consistent strategyIn these types of cases you need highly competent lawyers and a client who will listen and follow their advice Mr Cossack said If you dont have both you have what were seeing here chaos and disasterYou have a client who clearly thinks he has a better idea of how things should work than the lawyers who from time  time have ld him things he doesnt want  hear he added He is looking for the guy who can say I know how  handle Mueller I know you think he is bad and well take care of it Problem is you cant find that lawyer because no one will be able  do thatPeople close  the president say the upheaval in the legal team was inevitable When Mr Kasowitz ok the lead after Mr Mueller was appointed in May he wanted  follow a model used  Mr Clinn with a separate team of lawyers and communications professionals handling issues related  the inquiry so that the White House staff could keep its distanceBut Mr Trump who trusts few people and considers himself his best lawyer spokesman and strategist never wanted that type of system As a result his legal and public relations strategies have been out of sync with the president at times publicly contradicting his lawyers and the White House often finding itself flatfooted in the face of new disclosures about the Russia investigationThe presidents decision has also exposed many of his aides leaving them deeply enmeshed in an inquiry that is likely  cost them tens of thousands of dollars in legal feesBut while Mr Trump has struggled  find lawyers his family and his close associates are being represented  some of the countrys p legal talentHis soninlaw Jared Kushner has hired Abbe Lowell a longtime Washingn lawyer who recently got the Justice Department  drop corruption charges against Senar Robert Menendez Democrat of New Jersey after a lengthy court fightThree prominent current and former White House officials  the former chief strategist Stephen K Bannon the former chief of staff Reince Priebus and the White House counsel Donald F McGahn  are being represented  William A Burck who turned down the chance  represent the president Mr Burck a former federal prosecur represented FIFA in its legal problems in the United States and has worked for highprofile witnesses in federal investigations including Maureen McDonnell the wife of a former Virginia governorThe turmoil in Mr Trumps legal team started within weeks of the appointment of Mr Mueller Mr Kasowitz pushed for an adversarial approach  the special counsel which the president was poised  follow But Mr Kasowitz clashed with Mr Kushner and he was soon pushed aside after a series of missteps and embarrassing incidentsThe president then hired Mr Cobb a veteran Washingn lawyer  lead efforts within the White House as well as Mr Dowd who was put in charge of his personal legal team They advocated a strategy of cooperation telling the president that the sooner he gave Mr Muellers office what it wanted the sooner his name would be clearedWhile Mr Cobb had ld the president that the investigation would be over  now it seems  be accelerating Mr Mueller is still looking in a wide range of matters related  Mr Trumps corporate activities his 2016 campaign his associates and his time in officeMr Trump hoping  bolster his team met with Mr diGenova and Ms Toensing in recent days but according  two people ld of details about the meeting did not believe he had personal chemistry with themMs Hickss lawyer has strongly denied that suggestion and White House aides said Mr Corallos assertion had come up in discussions with the president as he weighed whether  go ahead with Mr diGenova and Ms ToensingMr diGenova had been expected  serve as an outspoken voice for the president as Mr Trump has increased his attacks on Mr Mueller Mr diGenova has endorsed the notion that a secretive group of FBI agents concocted the Russia investigation as a way  keep Mr Trump from becoming president a theory with little supporting evidenceCollapse,business
There is one thing about this case that should be made crystalclear at the outset the suit maintains The violence in Charlottesville was no accidentThe nine named plaintiffs  students clergy members and local residents who say they were hurt in Charlottesville  have accused the events leaders of plotting  deprive them of their civil rights  encouraging their followers  arm themselves and partake in violence Heather Heyers family is not among the plaintiffsThe defendants  an array of neoNazis white identitarians and oldline proConfederates  have ridiculed the charges as an act of lawfare maliciously intended  silence them and destroy them financiallyThe goal here is  break us and keep us from taking  the streets said Jeff Schoep the leader of the National Socialist Movement That should concern all Americans no matter where you stand on the political spectrumAs the case moves forward it is likely  explore the limits of the First Amendments broad freespeech provisions and the principle that incitements  violence are not protected Discovery in the case may also expose the links between the farright groups and their often opaque sources of financingI thought you could bring a suit under that same strategy Ms Kaplan said against the groups in CharlottesvilleMost of the defendants are being represented  two less prominent lawyers James Kolenich who is based in Cincinnati and Elmer Woodard who works in the Virginia countryside about two hours south of CharlottesvilleBefore the current case Mr Kolenich had never represented a member of the altright a farright fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and is often antiimmigrant antiSemitic and antiwomenIn order  prove that a conspiracy existed the plaintiffs lawyers will have  show that the leaders of the rally worked gether in planning and encouraging racially motivated violence Under the law if a conspiracy is eventually established all of its participants can be held accountable for the actions of its separate membersMs Kaplan called those leaked communications a lawyers gift and she used them in drafting her complaint They seemed  show a Discord channel for the rally filled with calls for violenceIm ready  crack skulls one person wrote Others said they planned  go  Charlottesville with wrenches pipes and wooden sticks One man claimed he was going with a cache of rifles that will shoot clean through a crowd at least four deep There were also plans  shuttle people  the rally grounds in what was called a Hate VanOne of the defendants Michael Peinovich the cohost of a podcast called The Daily Shoah downplayed the Discord messages as idle chitchat in his motion  dismiss Edgy humor and memes are part of Internet subculture Mr Peinovich wrote and while some may not understand them and some may find them offensive the sharing of such jokes and memes cannot credibly be seen as evidence of a conspiracy  commit violenceAnother defendant Richard B Spencer one of the countrys most prominent white supremacists wrote in his dismissal motion that harsh and bold words as well as scuffles are simply a reality of political protestsMr Spencer who is representing himself after several lawyers refused  take him as client went on  say Free societies not only in the United States but around the world accept this as a cost of free assembly and maintaining a vibrant political cultureThe chief planner of the Charlottesville event Jason Kessler wrote in an email this month that even though he was initially concerned about the lawsuit he now considers it an opportunity  go on offense Mr Kessler said he plans  use the case  attack the hoax narrative that the rightwing marchers were responsible for the violenceAfter all the lies about the event are laid out before the public and they realize how badly some very powerful people wanted  shut down our free speech rally he wrote I think the public will be hungrier than ever  hear what we actually went there  sayIn a different political climate Mr Mehlhorn said the Justice Departments civil rights division might have investigated and sued the planners of the Charlottesville protestBut he added These days we do not expect the Justice Department or government lawyers  pursue any of these actionsSome experts on farright extremism question whether the lawsuit will reveal anything beyond what is already known about the farright groups that they are hardly rich and tend  crowdsource what money they getProfessor Rosenthal said that rather than ruin the farright groups the lawsuit may just push them off the streets and back on  the internet where they existed quietly for yearsBecause the world is cyber he said its ugh  put people entirely out of businessCollapse,business
Lawmakers from both chambers are now headed  conference where they will try  work out their differences and emerge with a final bill that can be passed  the House and Senate and then sent  President Trumps desk  ChristmasGetting a bill signed in law  Mr Trump remains a p priority of Republican lawmakers and momentum  get something  his desk quickly remainsOn Tuesday Mr Trump said that lawmakers were working on the bill so that it comes out very beautifullyI call it the mixer he said Its a conference where everyone gets gether and they pick all the good things and get rid of the things they dont likeAnd below we outline some of the p issues that must be resolved before the legislation can be signed in lawSenate lawmakers in their bill seeking additional revenue brought back the corporate alternative minimum tax and reinstated a limited version of the alternative minimum tax for individuals The House bill eliminated both versions of the alternative minimum taxTogether the Senate changes are expected  raise about 173 billion over the next decade But the possible reinstatement of the corporate alternative minimum tax is eliciting significant blowback from businesses including the US Chamber of Commerce manufacturing companies technology companies and pharmaceutical companies which say it would undermine their ability  use valuable tax creditsThe reason Both bills cut the corporate tax rate  20 percent from 35 percent But the corporate alternative minimum tax is also set at 20 percent It is devised  ensure that companies cannot use loopholes  avoid paying taxes and requires that companies calculate their taxes under both the corporate rate and the alternative minimum rate and pay the greater amountBy lowering the corporate tax rate  20 percent but keeping the alternative minimum tax Congress is essentially setting a 20 percent floor Companies that try  use tax breaks  lower their effective tax rate like the research and development tax credit would still face the 20 percent alternative minimum tax nullifying the value of incentives that are supposed  promote researchLawmakers are scrambling  resolve the issue While they could simply do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax the Senate would then have  find additional revenue  ensure the legislation stays within the 15 trillion bucket that Congress has created for the tax cutsOne possible solution floating around is  increase the corporate tax rate  22 percent rather than 20 percent which would raise more revenue But that plan may not sit well with House Republicans many of whom have been unwavering in their push  lower the rate  20 percentThe House bill guts a number of itemized deductions while the Senate bill expands themMortgage interest deduction House caps at 500000 Senate retainsMedical expense deduction House repeals Senate expandsTeacher deduction for school supplies graduate student tuition waver student loan interest deduction House repeals all Senate expands or retains allThe Senate bill allows owners of businesses organized as passthroughs  deduct 23 percent of their business incomeThe House bill sets a new 25 percent tax on passthrough businesses and builds guardrails  prevent companies from exploiting the loopholeThe Senate bill creates seven income tax brackets 10 percent 12 percent 22 percent 24 percent 32 percent 35 percent and 385 percent Those brackets expire at the end of 2025The House bill creates four income tax brackets 12 percent 25 percent 35 percent and 396 percent Those brackets are permanentThe House bill ultimately kills the estate tax which Republicans refer  as the death tax because it is a tax on wealthy estates that are left  heirsThe Senate bill applies the death tax  fewer people  doubling the exemption  levels  11 million for individuals and 22 million for couples but it does not kill the taxThe Senate bill leaves the Johnson Amendment unuchedRepealing the amendment has long been a key priority of the religious right which views the ban as an example of government hostility  religion in the public square But such a repeal is opposed  thousands of religious and nonprofit leaders who warn that it could blur the line between charity and politicsMr Trump has pledged  repeal the 1954 ban and religious groups have said they expect it  be included in the final legislationCollapse,business
Common SenseBut Comcast startled invesrs and analysts on Wednesday with earnings that suggested there was still growth potential in old media Not only did the cable giant stem the tide of socalled cord cutters  adding video subscribers but results from NBCUniversal were every bit as dazzling as the latest financials from Amazon or ogles parent AlphabetUniversal theme park revenue jumped 39 percent for the quarter and the movie business rose 26 percent Over all NBCUniversal revenue rose more than 13 percent Comcast doesnt break out earnings for NBCUniversal but operating cash flow rose 87 percentSince 2009 when Comcast first bought a stake in NBCUniversal from its former parent General Electric an acquisition completed five years ago NBCUniversals cash flow has doubled The NBC television network which had been in fourth place for so long seven years that many doubted it could be resurrected is the leading network for the coveted 1849 age group powered  high ratings for Sunday Night Football and The Voice Strong franchises NBC Nightly News and Today have recouped the p spots in the ratings that had been threatened  scandal Brian Williams at Nightly News and a tearful onair departure Ann Curry at TodayI sat down this week with Steve Burke chief executive of NBCUniversal in his spacious lightfilled office at NBCUniversals headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza Despite the pressures of running a media giant with 285 billion in revenue he looks younger than his age of 57 years In our conversation one thing sod out about NBCUniversal which is true of all oldmedia companies Its all about the people This isnt like manufacturing Mr Burke said Its about talent If you get that wrong the whole enterprise goes bad very quicklyMr Burke grew up in broadcast television  his father Dan Burke was a former president of CapCities ABC and Steve Burke worked at Disney under the former chief executive Michael Eisner and then at Comcast where he was president of the cable division under the chairman and chief executive Brian RobertsToday much of Mr Burkes time seems  be spent courting coaxing stroking cajoling  and in some cases ejecting  highpaid highprofile stars and executives many with outsize egos In 2011 Mr Burke had  replace the prominent NBC Sports head Dick Ebersol just four weeks before the rights  the Sochi Olympics were auctionedLast year when the NBC Nightly news anchor Brian Williams acknowledged he fabricated details about his experiences covering combat in Iraq Mr Burke had  put their close friendship aside and deliver an inperson ultimatum  take a sixmonth leave without pay Agonizing Mr Burke ld meHe flew  California and spent a weekend with Jay Leno  negotiate the delicate transition  Jimmy Fallon as host of the Tonight show a year before Mr Lenos contract was set  expireStill dealing with stars like Mr Leno and Mr Fallon cant be delegated It was Mr Burke who coaxed Steven Spielberg back  his production roots at Universal Studios And some deals  NBCs multibilliondollar nineyear extension of Sunday Night Football for example  are so big they require the presence of Mr Roberts Mr Burkes bossWhile Mr Burke comes across as genial and lowkey hes a demanding boss Of the 16 NBCUniversal executives Mr Burke inherited from GE only four remainEarly in his tenure he summoned the p 200 managers  Orlando and ld them they had  do better I had  be stern Mr Burke said People thought everything was fine It wasnt I had  paint reality I ranked our p 10 businesses based on operating cash flow Eight of the 10 were in the third quartile meaning they woefully lagged their competirs He charged them  act like owners not renters  which means  invest for the long term  take responsibility and  fix problems themselves  a mantra now printed on the back of every NBCUniversal business card Its also one emphasized  Warren E Buffett  the managers running the various businesses at his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway where Mr Burke serves on the board Disclosure Im a weekly contribur  CNBC the NBCUniversalowned business channelTom Williams chairman and chief executive of Universal Parks  Resorts has been at Universal for 46 years The previous mentality was How can we take cash out of the business Mr Williams said Comcast encouraged even mandated reinvestment Weve had great success with creative concepts that have resonated with consumers Steve and Brian have said Keep reinvesting The returns are stellarUniversal recently acquired 51 percent ownership of Universal Studios Japan is opening another Harry Potter attraction in Hollywood and is building a new park in BeijingWith NBCUniversal pretty much firing on all cylinders Mr Burke has been able  turn his attention  the digital revolution He said he was looking  hire digital talent had personally interviewed 25 people in the last month and would probably establish an NBCUniversal digital headquarters in Santa Monica also known as Silicon Beach The company has taken 200 million stakes in the digital media companies BuzzFeed and Vox  and has started Seeso a digital comedy channelIts my biggest challenge he said Big media made the transition from broadcast  cable But we were still dealing with channels Now we have  move  digital Digital is different The DNA doesnt already reside in the companyInvesrs have already declared a winner in this emerging showdown Comcast sck trades at a priceearnings ratio of 18 Netflixs is 324 and Amazons is 425 meaning that invesrs are anticipating much higher growth at those companiesStill as old and new media converge and talent increasingly rivals engineering prowess in importance it may be worth asking how much oldmedia DNA resides in digital media giants like Facebook Amazon and Alphabet Mark Zuckerberg Mr Bezos and Larry  their respective chief executives arent primarily known for their people skills let alone the ability  cultivate Hollywood celebrities and TV starsMr Burke typically shuns the spotlight and insists that it is the reinvigorated culture and a deep bench that explains NBCUniversals recent success and momentum He said he was also aware that success in entertainment is often cyclicalStill its obvious that recent successes have fulfilled a lifelong goal Im a product of my dads influence at CapCities ABC my time at Disney and then at Comcast Mr Burke said I developed all these theories about how  run a big media company and I finally got an opportunity  try themCollapse,business

favorite words that this could be a great thing for jobs the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ld reportersIt looks bad  me said Chrispher L Sagers an antitrust professor at ClevelandMarshall College of LawLarry Downes an antitrust expert and a fellow at the Georgewn McDonough School of Business agreed The governments theory in Time Warner very much applies  Fox and Disney he said If the government doesnt challenge this it will look very weird he added But Im not sure appearances matter  this administrationI have never been instructed  the White House on this or any other transaction under review  the antitrust division he said of the ATT caseThats unlikely  sp speculation about his divisions handling of the latest blockbuster Antitrust experts ld me that in many ways the DisneyFox deal raises even more antitrust questions than does the combination of ATT and Time Warner Thats because its both a merger of direct competirs  a socalled horizontal merger which typically get close scrutiny  and has some of the same vertical elements that caused the Justice Department  try  block the ATTTime Warner mergerWhether a combination of the Fox film and television studios with Disneys entertainment arm would raise red flags under Justice Department guidelines depends on how the government defines the market The deal would reduce the number of Hollywood studios  five from six Last year Disneys studio accounted for 264 percent of the domestic theatrical box office the largest share and Fox was third with 129 percent Although the combined studios would have had close  40 percent of the market in 2016 thats typically not enough  run afoul of the departments merger guidelines Mr Sagers pointed out unless the government decides  define the market differentlyIf the market is as narrow as films about superheroes and Disney gains control of Foxs XMen franchise that would almost surely trigger concernsThere are more serious antitrust issues about Foxs regional sports networks given ESPNs dominance of cable sports If that market is measured  cable sports revenue the Disneyowned ESPN is so dominant that nearly any acquisition of another cable sports provider even Foxs relatively small regional networks would trigger antitrust reviewFrom a horizontal perspective sports is the main issue said Scott Hemphill a law professor and antitrust expert at New York University School of LawIf the Justice Department really wanted  be aggressive it might also invoke the words of former Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black who wrote in a landmark opinion The widest possible dissemination of information from diverse and antagonistic sources is essential  the welfare of the publicPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid

allsck transaction Given the concentrated market for cable news a combination of Fox News and Disneys ABC would most likely not have passed antitrust muster But depending on how much influence the Murdochs are able  exert at Disney the family might achieve much the same objective perhaps with a board seat or as some have speculated if James Murdoch joins Disney as an executive and even becomes a potential successor  the Disney chief executive Robert IgerSuch speculation may not be all that farfetched Reports suggest that James Murdoch is apparently in line for a senior management role within Disney as part of the deal said Doug Creutz senior media and entertainment analyst for Cowen  Co in a note  clients ThursdayMr Iger said during a conference call Thursday that James Murdochs future role if any hasnt been decidedMr Hemphill the law professor and antitrust expert pointed  an emerging antitrust doctrine called common ownership which looks beyond the formality of separate companies  examine who actually exerts controlAll those concerns are based on traditional antitrust review standards But since the case against ATT and Time Warner was filed those standards have been anything but traditionalVertical mergers like that of ATT and Time Warner  ATT buys content from Time Warner but doesnt compete directly with it  used  be approved almost routinely albeit often with conditions No longer Were in a psyturvy antitrust world Mr Downes saidOne of the governments concerns in its effort  block the ATT deal according  its complaint is the risk that ATT would withhold Time Warner content from rivals like Netflix thus hurting consumersBut Disney as it prepares  start its own directconsumer Netflix rival is already withholding some content and has said it would withhold much more as existing agreements expire It will almost surely pull 21st Century Fox content like X Men the planned Avatar sequels and TV shows like The Simpsons and The Americans and offer them on its own serviceMr Downes said he doesnt see how the Justice Department would distinguish between the two deals should it approve the FoxDisney transactionHow Mr Delrahim and the antitrust division handle the FoxDisney review remains  be seen of course But whatever he decides the shadow of Mr Murdoch will loom largeI hesitate  make any predictions about Trump and what hell do Mr Sagers said But theres a long tradition that the White House shouldnt get involved in these decisionsHe said he was reluctant  believe that Mr Delrahim would allow politics or Mr Trumps friendship with Mr

With the likelihood of major gains for their party on Election Day rising the most important task facing Democrats is the development of a coherent economic agenda that addresses issues that were central in both the Republican and Democratic primariesThere are preliminary signs that Democrats and their allies are willing  put gether just such an agendaThe two authors outline numerous proposals including some that would be risky for Democrats particularly those that call for the redistribution of resources from the partys upscale wing  downscale votersThese proposals include changes in the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit  benefit families with incomes of less than 100000 while reducing the benefits of the tax credit  the affluent as well as the reduction or elimination of tax breaks in education savings plans for the affluent  generate revenues  boost Pell grants for poorer studentsSawhill and Rodrigue dont shy away from what they see as a necessary step in combating economic inequalityIf we could empower young adults  only have children when they themselves feel ready  become parents we could reduce unplanned pregnancies and oufwedlock births That alone would reduce poverty and lack of mobility The solutions here are often nongovernmental and involve changing social norms around the importance of responsible twoperson parenthoodThey go onSome have called for a new generation of governmentsponsored marriage or relationship programs and for reducing marriage penalties in tax and benefit programs But with some exceptions these do not appear  be a costeffective way  bring back the twoparent family More promising are efforts  make the most effective forms of birth control IUDs and implants more widely available at no cost  womenthe specter of secular stagnation and inadequate economic growth on the one hand and ascendant populism and global disintegration on the other has caused widespread apprehensionamid fears that the global economy is entering unexplored and dangerous terriry And when economies worldwide stagnate the result Summers writes is that elecrates turn surly The way  counter these negative trends in his view is  abandon austerity economics in favor of investment economicsFurman focuses on a pair of crucial facrs underlying slow growth a lack of corporate dynamism and the weakening of competitive forces in the marketplace Diminishing vitality in the marketplace has become a mounting concern among economists and policy makersOne advantage of Furmans approach is that it cuts across ideological boundariesTo support his case Furman cites a wide range of data and reports These include the finding that in 42 percent of the roughly 900 industries examined the p four firms controlled more than a third of the market in 2012 up from 28 percent of industries in 1997 and that in financial services the loan market share of the p ten banks increased from about 30 percent in 1980  about 50 percent in 2010If the creation of new firms is a marker of a thriving competitive economy Furman argues that the trends are not favorable The accompanying chart shows a sharp decline over the past 30plus years in the percentage of companies that are five years old or less from just over 50 percent in 1982  roughly 33 percent now and a decline in the share of tal employment provided  these young firms from roughly 21 percent in 1982  about 11 percent nowNew companies defined as up  five years old accounted for about onethird of the economy in 2013 down from more than half in 1982 Proportionately their share of employment had a larger drop50350Share of all US companies4032930208Share of all US employment2010109019828590950005102013The decline in corporate dynamism has been accompanied  a decline in labor dynamism with workers less likely  move between jobs industries occupations and locations Furman writesWhat Furman describes is a nation suffering from what amounts  economic arteriosclerosis This has not hurt corporate management and the owners of capital  sckholders  but it has been disastrous for workersFurman argues that both market concentration and frictions that reduce worker mobility can lead  greater monopsony power for employers monopsony is a buyers monopoly With fewer firms competing for a given type of worker Furman contendseach firm is more likely  exercise local monopsony and their smaller numbers may also facilitate tacit or explicit collusion If on p of that employees face greater search frictions or costs of moving then this reduces their ability  raise their wages  changing jobs and thus also reduces their bargaining power with their current employerThe growing strength of businesses  bargain for low wages bolstered  the decline in unionized employment and the falling value of the minimum wage has contributed  the declining share of tal income going  workers Furman describes the trend as followsStarting around 2000 the distribution of income between labor and capital shifted noticeably away from the former and wards the latter Today the labor share of income is in the mid50s compared  the mid60s two decades agoDespite rising returns  capital there has not been a parallel increase in business investment One explanation Furman argues is that monopoly power has increased  which is consistent with higher returns and lower outputWorkers share of income began a sharp slide in 2001 and has not recovered Figures for nonfarm business secr66651643646260Recessions5815856through2nd qtr2016194858687888980866651643646260Recessions5815856through2nd qtr2016194858687888982008Together declining firm dynamism high returns and low output and disparities in the rate of return on investment are all potential consequences of increasing barriers  entry and restraining the operation of a free and open marketWith these findings in place Furman has laid out the groundwork for a liberal Democratic agendaTo the extent that these macroeconomic trends are related  decreased competition then procompetitive policies have potential  not only benefit consumers but also improve the state of the macroeconomy  for example increasing productivity and ensuring that the benefits of growth are widely sharedFurman describes four areas where procompetitive reforms are possible  and in some cases have already been initiatedThe first is intellectual property and patent reform areas where there is growing bipartisan agreement that excessive and often frivolous patent claims and the emergence of a new breed of patent rt litigars have held back innovation especially technological innovationThe second is the need  increase the bargaining power of workers whose leverage has steadily declined More stringent antitrust enforcement could break up some business consolidation giving workers access  job mobility the practice of requiring employees  sign noncompete agreements should also be restrainedThe third area is reform of state laws requiring occupational licensing which Furman describes as an example of policies that create inefficient and inequitable rents and which have grown fivefold in the second half of the 20th century from less than 5 percent of the work force in the early 1950s  25 percent  2008While such licensing is needed in the case of health and safety occupations in otherslicensing requirements create economic rents for licensed practitioners at the expense of excluded workers and consumers  increasing inefficiency and potentially also increasing inequalityInsofar as the licensing serves a legitimate need the federal government can press for crossborder portability giving licensees more opportunity  cross state lines for better jobsThe fourth is reform of land use regulationOverly burdensome landuse restrictions  like minimum lot sizes offstreet parking requirements height limits prohibitions on multifamily housing or lengthy permitting processes  can instead artificially reduce competition  acting as supply constraints Furman contends In doing so such policies both allow a small number of landowners  capture economic rents and reduce the sck of available affordable housingFurman notes that land use constraints limit productivity growth and labor mobility  making it more difficult for workers  move  higherproductivity citiesOne of the most vexing problems facing those seeking  develop a liberal procompetition agenda is the emergence of the digital marketplaceThe complexity of the economics of the internet is according  Furman reflected in the following contradiction On one hand internet markets have tended  favor digital giants that hold high market shares and digitalization also poses an increased danger of opaque price fixing through the use of advanced machine learning algorithms  set prices and adapt product functionality On the other hand the digital marketplace has encouraged competition  lowering many costs for small businesses increasing their ability  rapidly and inexpensively scale up collect information on potential consumers and create new products and ideasThere is disagreement among economists concerning Furmans workLawrence Katz an economist at Harvard wrote me  email I am a big fan of Jason Furman and think the directions he has been sketching on technology competition and globalization make a lot of senseDavid Card an economist at Berkeley conversely wrote that he does not think Furmans proposals will amount  more than a couple of percentage points higher wages or a few percent lower prices for low  middle income folks Overall Card said I am deeply skeptical  say the leastI would argue that even if Card is right wages that are a couple of percentage points higher are nothing  sneeze atFurmans proposals should not be viewed in isolation but as one piece of a broader liberal agenda  an agenda that could include some or all of what Larry Summers Isabel Sawhill and others have proposedThe economy has added nearly 107 million jobs median household income has gone up 1140 or 2 percent the buying power of the average workers weekly paycheck is up 42 percent the median sales prices of existing singlefamily homes are up 23 percent the unemployment rate has dropped well below the hisrical norm job openings are at a 15year high corporate profits and sck prices have both soared  record highs the number of people lacking health insurance has gone down  165 million the murder rate is down nearly 5 percent despite an increase in 2015 and the number of unauthorized immigrants estimated  be living in the US is down according  demographersThere have also been a number of failures as Factcheckorg also pointed out perhaps most notably a 36 percent rise in the number of Americans on food stamps and a 03 increase in the poverty rateAssuming for the moment that Clinn is Obamas successor it will fall  her  build on his record and  address the yearning of those hardpressed voters who have felt for far o

Most presidents will at some point benefit from a surging economy and sck market but none has claimed more credit for them than Donald J Trump as he did again during this weeks State of the Union address Among the highlights 8 trillion and more in sck market gains 24 million new jobs created since his election Over 3 million workers have gotten taxcut bonuses and rising wages All thanks  the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American hisrySince the president has frequently complained that the media denies him credit for any of this I thought it only fair  assess the degree  which the undeniably strong economy low unemployment and surging sck market are because of Mr Trumps achievements notably his sweeping tax billIt turns out thats no easy task especially since Mr Trump has only been president for a year and the tax legislation is little more than a month old Economists are still debating the impact on the economy of Ronald Reagans 1986 tax reform legislation more than 30 years after its passageWith that in mind heres a look at the major areas where Mr Trump claims creditThe SP 500 index rose 23 percent during Mr Trumps first year in office an increase surpassed only  Franklin Roosevelt and Barack Obama both Democrats who ok office in the wake of financial crises and sck market crashes Mr Trumps policies and Republicans in Congress deserve some credit given that economists expect the cut in corporate taxes  raise company earnings and sck prices are fundamentally a reflection of earnings expectationsTheres no question aftertax earnings will be higher thanks  the tax legislation Professor Slemrod saidBut the estimated impact on aftertax earnings  a range of 7  10 percent according  most economists  accounts for less than half the sck markets rise over the past year The rest is because of other facrs which may include Mr Trumps probusiness outlook but also many things beyond his controlSck market valuations are reaching lofty levels  many measures and those gains may prove ephemeral if growth doesnt live up  invesrs rosy expectations The value of the sck market isnt an indicar of the economic health of America Professor Slemrod notedGross domestic product grew  23 percent last year lower than Mr Trumps predictions of 3plus percent but significantly better than the 16 percent growth in 2016 Mr Obamas last year in officeAs should be obvious passage of the Republican tax legislation was o recent  have had any impact on those numbers To the extent that expectations of tax reform fueled investment decisions they may have had some effect but thats nearly impossible  measureThe first real clues will come next year when 2018 gross domestic product numbers are released The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new tax legislation would raise GDP  seventenths of a percent over what it would have been under the old lawThe economy has been strong and forecasts for next year have been bumped up due  the tax cut  said Professor Auerbach But theres a lot going on You wont be able  tell what the impact is from just a few quartersEven 10 years after the 1986 law it was very difficult  tease out the impact of tax reform on the economy he said The best estimate is it didnt have much effectProfessor Slemrod agreed Tax policy might not be as critical  the rate of business investment as had been thought he saidStill if United States economic growth hits Chinese levels of 7 percent a year or more which Mr Trump repeatedly has said is attainable then Republicans will have a much stronger basis for claiming credit for it Professor Slemrod said But he deemed such an outcome extraordinarily unlikelyThe tax overhaul has prompted hundreds of employers including at least 40 members of the Standard  Poors 500sck index  pass on savings  workersMany companies have been doling out bonuses  employees since the tax legislation passed but I dont think that tells us anything Professor Slemrod said Thats because in standard economic theory labor market conditions dictate employee compensation levels not cash flow or profitabilityThe labor market was strengthening long before Mr Trump was elected or the tax bill was passed Professor Slemrod said If companies were going  raise wages anyway  stay competitive they have a public relations incentive  attribute it  tax cutsWage growth actually slowed during the first year of Mr Trumps presidency compared with the last year of Mr ObamasPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersMr Auerbach added that given the length of the recovery and low levels of unemployment many economists have been wondering why we havent seen stronger wage growth as competition for labor heats up Now we may be starting  see itMuch the same can be said about unemployment which fell  41 percent from 47 percent during Mr Trumps first year as president and which also reflects the tight labor market conditions that have been developing for years The unemployment rate fell much more during the Obama years three full percentage points from when Mr Obama ok office until when he left which would be expected given the severe recession he inheritedIn any event its far o soon  evaluate Mr Trumps impact on the labor market Economists generally agree that at least some of the Republican tax cuts will flow through  workers although there are widely differing projections about how much and most say the largest share will go  shareholders in the form of dividends sck buybacks and higher share prices Professor Slemrod said we may never know for sure but in five or six years we may be able  tell if some of the more extreme claims are reasonableUnlike the 1986 tax legislation which claimed  be revenueneutral the latest Republican bill is a huge tax cut The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the new law would add just over 1 trillion  the deficit over the next decade It predicted higher interest rates as a result which it estimated would cost the Treasury an additional 66 billion in debt service costsSome supporters of the tax law contend that economic growth will come so quickly that increased tax revenue will more than make up for the cuts The actual impact on the deficit wont be evident for at least a year but the rising deficits that followed tax cuts in 1981 forced Republicans  raise taxes in both 1982 and 1984Interest rates are already trending higher Both Professors Auerbach and Slemrod agreed that rates are likely  rise further and would be an important measure of the impact of the tax legislation and Mr Trumps economic policies If they rise faster than at the cautious pace the Federal Reserve has projected and invesrs expect that could bring the sck market rally  an abrupt end Higherthanexpected rates could also slow the economy or even tip it in recessionHow sensitive the sck market is  interest rates was on display the same day as Mr Trumps speech when shares plunged on fears of higher rates after the 10year Treasury yield rose above 27 percent thats still very low  hisric standards but higher than when Mr Trump ok officeThe big tax cut is a large economic stimulus and right now stimulus is a danger said Professor Auerbach given that there is nearly full employment and alreadystrong economic growthWell know a year from now whether the Federal Reserve stuck with its projected three increases in rates this year and whether any exceeded quarterpoint incrementsThe botm line Presidents tend  get credit or blame for whatever economies they preside over but its far o soon  evaluate Mr Trumps longterm impact Even after years have passed Professor Slemrod said Well never know with 100 percent

older Class B office buildings a notch below higherquality Class A buildings have dropped  40 percent in 20 years because of conversionsTo encourage conversions in the nations capital where the office vacancy rate is around 114 percent the districts Council members are considering legislation  provide a tax abatement of up  20 per square feet for 10 years capped at 5 million a year The DownwnDC and lden Triangle Business Improvement Districts two adjoining associations of property owners that represent the area back the legislationBut the office of Mayor Muriel E Bowser who must sign the bill in law has some reservationsI would say were listening hard said Brian T Kenner deputy mayor for planning and economic development Weve got  see what the cost is and how much revenue that can create and be put  affordable housing a key priority of the Bowser administration The district requires 8  12 percent of housing  be lowercost units Still  come is an essential statement of the bills fiscal impact from the citys chief financial officerAn estimated 89000 people work in the socalled lden Triangle an area of prime real estate that extends from the White House  Dupont Circle The hope is that conversions will give it more of a 24hour neighborhood feelThe situation is not yet dire Washingns office vacancy rate is lower than the regions which is 163 percent and expected  rise  nearly 17 percent  late 2019 according  Newmark Knight Frank a New Yorkbased real estate services firm But the fear is with more office buildings being built the overall commercial vacancy rates in the district will also climb leading  lower office rentsProponents hope that the conversion bill will help both the market and the neighborhoodWe believe this bill will strengthen citys tax base while adding residents and ensuring the longtime economic vitality of our downwn said Leona Agouridis executive direcr of the lden Triangle Business Improvement District It is a policy question Do we want  have residents in the downwn area If so what are we willing  do  help realize it This is a catalystGerry Widdicombe a consultant  the DownwnDC Business Improvement District said the idea behind the legislation was  educate the market on how this can be done without hurting the citys tax base or the building owners botm line Its working in the suburbs because their office markets are really really weakJack Evans a Democratic member of the Council and the bills sponsor said the bill would enable a Manhattanizing of the District of Columbia bringing more vitality  the citys core  encouraging an influx of fulltime residents who could walk  work while patronizing near shops and restaurants But for the citys involvement we would not get what they are looking forIn the lden Triangle 77 percent of the office buildings were erected from 1960  1990 Ms Agouridis suggested that owners must soon decide whether  demolish and rebuild or renovate them  the higher Class A or premium Trophy building standardsIts natural in the cycle of buildings she said Its like your home you get  certain point you need  replace major systems But with renovation comes opportunity From a neighborhood perspective it makes a lot of sense  get that conversion goingIn Washingn some owners have sought  upgrade older buildings  Class A  reskinning the facades giving them a more modern look and reducing energy costs So far building owners in Washingn continue  favor such cosmetic facelifts over more substantial conversionsAnother facr contributing  rising office vacancy rates according  Mr Widdicombe is that some companies notably law firms are relocating  newer buildings where they are leasing less space per employee a workplace trend known as densificationA new concept in Washingn conversions have been implemented elsewhere More than 375 million square feet of older office space that has reached functional obsolescence in the nation has been converted  residential use over the last decade according  JLLIn Washingns Maryland and Virginia suburbs for instance higher office vacancy rates have resulted in more conversions of older buildings without the use of government incentivesIn Old Town a neighborhood in Alexandria Va the former offices of the Sheet Metal Workers International Union are now the Oronoco a 60unit luxury condominium on the Pomac River waterfront with prices ranging from 13 million  28 million In Fairfax County Washingns most populous suburb the county government recently voted  streamline rezoning for the repurposing of commercial buildingsIn near Silver Spring Md a 1964 office building was converted in the 102unit condo called Octave 1320 without the kind of tax abatement proposed for Washingn and other conversions are scheduled  take placeBut in Washingns core the argument goes the shift will occur only with government action Mixeduse neighborhoods create a more livable area better use of infrastructure and expand the income tax base said Ms Agouridis It is unlikely residential development in the central business district will occur naturally without the kind of incentive this bill will involveThus proponents say residential housing will continue  be in great demand but short supplyThe threesry Jefferson Place wnhouses built originally as singlefamily homes during the Gilded Age are a notable exception But they have a mixed zoning hisry They long housed commercial tenants but the buildings were converted in 2006 in condos ranging from 499000 for a onebedroom  2 million for threebedroom unitsCollapse,business
For more than two decades R Kelly the multiplatinum RB idol repeatedly accused of sexual misconduct has outrun his reputation In the age of MeToo it may finally be catching up  himIn a statement from and addressed  women of color Times Up wrote The scars of hisry make certain that we are not interested in persecuting anyone without just cause With that said we demand appropriate investigations and inquiries in the allegations of R Kellys abuse made  women of color and their families for over two decades nowThis is starting  feel like a success Oronike Odeleye a founder of the MuteRKelly campaign said in an interview on Monday Having Times Up amplify it support it  this community this village is stepping in and demanding that these things changeThe Times Up letter cited RCA Records a division of Sony Music that has released R Kellys last four albums Ticketmaster a division of the megapromoter Live Nation which sells tickets  his concerts Spotify and Apple Music the popular streaming services and the Greensboro Coliseum Complex a venue scheduled  host the singer this month in North Carolina RCA and Apple declined  comment Spotify Ticketmaster and the Greensboro Coliseum did not respond  requests for commentRepresentatives for Mr Kelly replied in a statement on Monday R Kelly supports the prowomen goals of the Times Up movement they wrote We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way  draw attention  those goals  and in this case it is unjust and offtargetCalling the campaign a greedy conscious and malicious conspiracy  demean him his family and the women with whom he spends his time the statement continued R Kellys music is a part of American and AfricanAmerican culture that should never  and will never  be silenced Since America was born black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it We will vigorously resist this attempted public lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions  our cultureAfter years of uring and new music from R Kelly that passed without much incident interest in the allegations against the singer picked up again last summer after a series of articles  the longtime Chicago music journalist Jim DeRogatisThe articles last year also resurfaced claims about R Kelly  such as the brief marriage  his musical protg Aaliyah in 1994 when she was 15 and he was 27  which when combined with the new information galvanized Ms Odeleye an Atlanta resident  start what would become MuteRKellyAfter reading the hisry and realizing he was doing it in my backyard I remember sitting at my computer and feeling furious and overwhelmed she said I decided  start a petition  get him off the radio If the police cant seem  arrest this man we as a community can at least say were not going  give him our money The Fuln County District Atrneys Office in Georgia said it was not currently investigating Mr Kelly over any allegationsMs Odeleye soon joined forces with a local activist Kenyette Barnes who helped  organize local petitions and protests wherever R Kelly had concerts scheduled He is a man of power  the king of RB Ms Barnes said You dont become the king without a very strong fan base and support system We wanted  dismantle thatTen concerts were called off and while promoters cited various reasons including low ticket sales Ms Odeleye and Ms Barnes said they had no doubt that their protests had worked And within months the womens mission began  dovetail with the growing chorus of those saying MeToo and momentum for MuteRKelly picked up A BBC documentary that aired in March R Kelly Sex Girls and Videotapes added  the growing discontentWithin the AfricanAmerican community unfortunately the issue of child sexual abuse is very very taboo Ms Odeleye said We have a tendency  try  separate the child from the abuser but we will not kick the dangerous person out of homes out of our communities Thats just not good enoughTrevian Kutti a former spokeswoman for the singer confirmed on Monday that she and a personal assistant Diana Copeland were no longer affiliated with him citing only unfortunate circumstances Still Ms Kutti spoke admiringly about the singerI am no longer successfully able  represent Mr Robert Kelly she wrote in an email Mr Kelly is The Worlds Greatest I am grateful  have had the experience of representing himLinda Mensch a lawyer who recently represented the singer said she resigned in February but declined  comment furtherDespite the rash of accusations Mr Kelly is not known  be facing any investigations for sexual abuse Susan E Loggans a lawyer who has negotiated at least three settlements with women who said they were victimized  the singer said that criminal prosecution continued  seem unlikelyI feel that since he was already tried already acquitted she said referring  the 2008 case that states atrneys are reluctant  do it It costs millions of dollars would drag on for a long period of time and there is a general skepticism about whether it would be successfulIf he got acquitted next time nobody would ever have a chance Ms Loggans said Prosecution is very hesitant  do that over againFor now Mr Kelly appears most concerned with the state of his live concert business  a reliable revenue stream for any artist of his hitmaking caliber In a video posted  Twitter on Sunday he insisted that he would be performing on May 11 in North Carolina and he questioned why his Chicago appearance was scrappedIve never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors he said but I guess theres a first time for everythingIt aint on me he addedCollapse,business

Mr Martins arrest is the second time in three years that a Booz Allen contracr has been accused of stealing potentially damaging material from the NSA The company also employed Edward J Snowden who spirited out a cache of documents that in 2013 exposed the extent of American surveillance programs in the United States and around the worldBooz Allen is one of a handful of defense and intelligence contracrs that blur the line between the governments intelligence work and private enterpriseTens of thousands of contracrs are believed  work for American intelligence agencies the exact number is not known They do everything from helping secure the military against cyberattacks and plan intelligence operations  training spies and running war games for NATO generalsWhat most people dont realize is just the sheer scale of the intelligence work force that is outsourced said Peter W Singer a national security expert at New America a think tank in Washingn There will be meetings and less than 10 percent of the people there are official US government employees as opposed  contracrsFirms like Booz Allen provide a ready and potentially lucrative option for federal employees who are looking  cash in on their government experienceBooz Allen founded in 1914 has done especially well at building its government business Its clients include every branch of the military and a long list of intelligence organizations from the NSA  lesserknown outfits such as the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency which is essentially a hightech mapping operation Overseas Booz Allen has helped the United Arab Emirates build its own hightech spy agencyThe direcr of national intelligence during the George W Bush administration Mike McConnell was an executive at Booz Allen President Obamas direcr of national intelligence James R Clapper Jr worked for the firm before returning  government  oversee the nations spy agenciesIn its last fiscal year which ended in March Booz Allen earned 39 billion  about three quarters of its tal revenue  from its defense and intelligence business Once its work for other parts of the government is facred in Booz Allens government contracting accounted for 97 percent of its revenueBut as the two thefts have made clear employing large numbers of contracrs brings security risks though experts point out that there have been many leaks in recent years that came from government employees as wellBooz Allen weathered the Snowden leaks and it was cleared of any wrongdoing  the Air Force It has so far had little  say about the Martin case issuing a brief statement on Wednesday saying it had fired Mr Martin and was cooperating with the investigationUnlike Mr Snowden some officials have said Mr Martin does not appear  have leaked any of the information he is suspected of stealing which is believed  be highly classified computer codeBut the problem for Booz Allen is that at least some of the documents alleged  have been found in Mr Martins possession date  2014 That would call in question the effectiveness of reforms aimed at safeguarding the nations secrets announced in the wake of the Snowden affairWe have been and will continue  assess the proper role of contract employees in the intelligence community many of whom play a vital role said Representative Adam B Schiff of California the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee We must be careful not  overcorrect or  draw the wrong lessons This issue is fundamentally about preventing and detecting insider threats both from contracrs like Edward Snowden and this individual and from government employeesThe leak in 2013 of the materials slen  Mr Snowden prompted calls from Sen Dianne Feinstein of California then the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee for contracrs like Booz Allen  lose their access  highly sensitive intelligence The Obama administration meanwhile tightened security measures at intelligence agencies and slashed the number of employees with access  classified information  17 percentThe role of contracrs has grown since the 1990s when they were seen as a way  save money and accelerated in the aftermath of the Sept 11 terrorist attacksProponents of using contracrs say they allow the government  quickly bring in people with technical expertise and allow government agencies  get around staffing and budgetary constraints set  CongressA glaring example of how contracrs are used  get around staffing limits can be seen in Afghanistan There the Obama administration has set a hard limit on the number of troops that can be deployed  it currently stands at 9800 The Defense Department and State Department have as a result brought in thousands of contracrs  do everything from serve food  analyze secret intelligence There are currently believed  be about six contracrs for every American government employee in AfghanistanAt the same time the use of contracrs has often failed  deliver on the promised savings Critics also say that shifting sensitive work in the hands of private businesses which are not subject  same disclosure rules as federal agencies often limits the ability of Congress  provide oversightJo Becker contributed reporting from New YorkCollapse,business
The newly inaugurated President Trump tapped Steven T Mnuchin as treasury secretary Gary D Cohn as direcr of the National Economic Council and Dina Powell as White House adviser Ms Powell later served as both deputy national security adviser for strategy and senior counselor for economic initiativesAnthony Scaramucci another ldman alumnus was on the transition team en route  the post of White House communications direcr months later Outranking them all was Stephen K Bannon the chief White House strategist who worked at the bank early in his career and who reported directly  the presidentDepending on ones point of view this was either a sellout  Wall Street  a president who had railed against ldman during the campaign or a welcome check on some of Mr Trumps more radical tendenciesAs the Trump adviser and former House speaker Newt Gingrich put it last year It would be interesting  see  what degree the New York liberals change Trump and  what degree Trump changes the New York liberalsNow the verdict would appear  be in Mr Trump remains the impulsive freewheeling provocateur in chief and much of the ldman contingent has been banished or is leaving the White HouseEveryone was wondering who would dominate the White House Steve Bannon or the Manhattan mafia Mr Gingrich ld me this week referring  the ldman alumni It turns out Donald Trump dominated the White House Surprise That should have been obvious  anyone who knows anything about TrumpRoy C Smith a former ldman partner and professor of management practice at New York Universitys Stern School of Business agreed I never really thought the ldman crowd would tame Trump he said They didnt share a common agenda or a common bondThat was almost immediately apparent as the White House descended in multiple warring factions with the ldman alumni often in opposing camps The flamethrowing impulses of Mr Bannon in particular were often at odds with the more measured pragmatic styles of Mr Cohn and Ms Powell ldman veterans ld me the Bannon persona that emerged during the campaign and at the White House bears little resemblance  the cleancut hardworking young mergersandacquisitions banker they rememberNow Mr Cohn is widely expected  leave as well the only question being how soon Mr Cohn fell out with Mr Trump after he distanced himself from the presidents racially charged comments about last summers riots in Charlottesville Va Mr Cohn drafted a resignation letter at the time but had second thoughts and stayedMr Cohn has subsequently redeemed himself  a large degree  executing the presidents economic agenda He helped deliver a sweeping tax overhaul the administrations signature achievement so far and has stayed out of the public eye which Mr Trump likes At times Mr Trump has seemed  enjoy having a former ldman Sachs president working for him given that ldman had long shunned him as a clientPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersProfessor Smith of NYU said he hoped Mr Cohn would leave soon because his reputation will be mangled if he staysHe delivered the tax legislation he said Whether you agree with it or not he executed Thats his skill And he sod up  the president after Charlottesville People respect that I think he could leave now with his reputation intactAlone among the prominent ldman alumni in the administration Mr Mnuchin seems likely  stay Hes been a good and loyal employee Professor Smith said But hes more of a Hollywood person now His reputation in the professional financial secr may not matter that much  himMr Bannon and Mr Scaramucci aside any socalled exodus may be a function of what they achieved Mr Gingrich said of the ldman veteransTheres nothing on the agenda this year thats nearly as exciting as reshaping the tax code he said They worked very hard and tried  do things that were effective In that sense they were a real assetAt the same time Mr Gingrich contended that Mr Trump  and not his advisers  deserved the lions share of credit for the tax bill for building confidence in the economy and for not launching a trade warHe has a much broader capacity than people in the District of Columbia give him credit for Mr Gingrich said of the president People get so wound up in the goofier things he does the tweets and outrageous statements But underneath that is a very methodical and pragmatic businessman He knows how  use competent peopleWhether Mr Trump can replace the departing ldman alumni with people of similar stature remains  be seen Mr Gingrich pointed  Mr Trumps appointment of Jerome Powell as the new Federal Reserve chairman as evidence that he will be able  recruit p economic talentProfessor Smith said anyone considering a job at the White House would have  weigh the high risks of tethering his or her reputation  the Trump presidency Even so he said you can never underestimate the allure of being a big shot in WashingnNot that many ldman partners are known outside the firm he added Why hang out at ldman when you could be having lunch on Mount Olympus,business
Edirial ObserverThe easylistening white supremacists who surged out of the shadows during the presidential campaign are no less dangerous than their white power survivalist or raving skinhead counterparts But they are hoping  rebrand themselves  wearing business clothes and attempting  sound reasonable as they advance a racist agenda The debate about removing monuments  white supremacy that were built throughout the South a century or more ago is tailormade for this tacticThe white supremacist protest in Charlottesville Va this month over a plan  remove a statue of Robert E Lee the Confederate general shows how this is likely  go The marchers feigned civility But a closer look shows that the protest drew on the xic symbolism of the Third Reich in ways that few Americans would recognizeThe demonstrars at Charlottesville  led  the theatrically inclined white supremacist Richard Spencer  had no real interest in the civic or aesthetic value of the monument they ostensibly came  defend The essence of their argument was that any attempt  renounce Confederate ideology  moving this  or any  monument would be an assault on the socalled white raceThe protest also celebrated the intimate connection between Naziera rule in Germany and Jim Crowera rule in the United States That connection long overlooked  hisrians was obvious  the network of blackowned newspapers that reached the peak of its influence during World War IIThe barons of the Negro press ridiculed the attempt  frame the war as a fight for liberty at a time when the military was segregating  race soldiers nurses and even plasma in the wartime blood bank and running Jim Crow military bases in ways that were fully consistent with the German view of Negroes and others as not fully humanEdirial caronists underscored this point  depicting Hitler and Hirohi gether laughing uproariously while reading newspaper accounts of lynchings in the American South The Pittsburgh Courier finally made it palatable  AfricanAmericans  support the war in Europe  recasting it as a struggle  vanquish Nazism abroad and Jim Crow racism at homeHitler drew a similar more sinister comparison in Mein Kampf He describes the United States as the one state that had made headway ward what he regarded as a healthy and utterly necessary racist regime Hisrians have long sought  minimize the importance of that passage But in recent years archival research in Germany has shown that the Nazis were keenly focused on Jim Crow segregation laws on statutes that criminalized interracial marriage and on other policies that created secondclass citizenship in the United StatesHitlers American Model shows that homegrown American racism played a role in the norious Nuremberg Laws of 1935 which deprived nonAryans of citizenship and the right  marry true Germans As Mr Whitman writes Nuremberg signaled the fullscale creation of a racist state in a Germany on the road  the HolocaustNazism and the tradition of American white supremacy that is memorialized in monuments throughout the South are the fruit of the same poisonous tree In this light the Confederate flag can legitimately be seen as an alternate version of the Nazi emblemAfter the war Germany tried  put Nazism back in its box  banning public display of swastikas and other emblems of the Third Reich Later generations undersod that  wear such an insignia was  smear oneself with hisrys worst filth Many Americans have failed  grasp this point This explains why one still sees people parading around with both Nazi emblems and Confederate flags openly embracing the meanings of bothThe newage white supremacists who want so eagerly  expand their market shares recognize that covering themselves with swastikas is a route  marginalization They are betting that they can achieve the effect they seek  embracing the Confederate cause while serving up easylistening Nazism on the sideCollapse,business
Common SenseSo much for the January barometerDuring the first five trading days of this year the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 6 percent the worst start  a new year ever for invesrsFor all of January it dropped 55 percent the worst January since 2009 and the depths of the financial crisisFor followers of the Sck Traders Almanac and others who look for patterns in the sck market those were resounding portents of financial doomAs January goes so goes the entire market year is one of the bestknown aphorisms from the Sck Traders Almanac an annual compilation of dates statistics and advice for invesrs that was first published in 1968  Yale HirschMoreover in presidential election years the almanac posits that the markets performance during the first five days of trading will determine if the market ends up or down for the yearBut after a major postelection rally the market was a hairs breadth away from the milesne of 20000 on the Dow and the SP 500sck index and Nasdaq were also setting records The Dow was up 12 percent for the year the SP 500 was up in excess of 9 percent and the Nasdaq gained nearly 8 percentNo barometer of course is always right But over the last 10 years the January barometer gave false negative indications in 2014 2010 and 2009 and a false positive in 2011 With its spectacular failure this year it has been right just 50 percent of the time over the last decade  which means it is essentially worthless as a predicrJeff Hirsch Yale Hirschs son and now edir and publisher of the almanac acknowledged this week that both barometers had missed the mark this year but said their longterm record remained intact and that they had accurately anticipated the correction that botmed out in February In any event he has never said that invesrs should rely solely on the almanacs predictions in making investment decisionsHuman nature being what it is thats not likely  sp invesrs from searching for predictive patterns such as the relationship between sck performance and presidential elections which has produced a bullish signal this yearThe almanac points out that during the years of a Republican president and a Republican majority in both the House and Senate the SP 500 has risen on average 141 percent The markets track record for a Democratic president and Republican House and Senate is even better at 164 percent on averageWere now in the midst of what some are calling the Trump effect which posits that scks are poised  soar even more not just because of hisrical patterns but thanks  a new business and invesrfriendly Trump administrationIf this guy pulls it gether and really creates some change if we see some political functionality and he pushes some constructive things through despite his rants and diatribes we could be at the start of a superboom cycle Mr Hirsch ld me Then again he continued if he fumbles this then all bets are offBelievers in the Trump effect have gained confidence from the powerful market rally that kicked in after Mr Trumps surprise vicryThis week I asked James Stack president of InvesTech Research  compare the markets performance during the 34 days since the election with every other election year going back  1928 He ld me the postelection rise in the SP 500 of 55 percent through Monday was the best everBut whether further gains are ahead is an open question Mr Stack pointed out that all presidential election correlations are of dubious predictive validity because the database is o small from 1916 through Mr Trumps vicry in November there have been just 26 presidential elections over the last 100 yearsIn heavily blue places like Manhattan theres an entirely different Trump effect the belief hes about  take the economy over a cliff Invesrs who support that idea should dump scks and retreat  the safety of government bonds  though the safety of even those may be suspect given Mr Trumps past threat  renege on the national debtThis camp o can point  hisrical precedent After the election of Herbert Hoover in 1928 the SP 500 ran up 92 percent  the end of November the biggest fastest postpresidential election gain ever The honeymoon didnt last long We all know what happened in 1929Mr Trump himself has emerged as a bearish sck market prognosticar declaring during the first presidential debate in September We are in a big fat ugly bubble If so it has only gotten fatter sinceTo help navigate these conflicting signals I turned  Burn Malkiel emeritus professor of economics at Princen and author of the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street The TimeTested Strategy for Successful InvestmentMr Malkiels advocacy of the efficient market theory his many years as a direcr of the mutual fund giant Vanguard and his current position as chief investment officer for the aumated investment firm Wealthfront have all contributed  the rise of socalled passive investingThe problem with all these data people is that you can find correlations anywhere he ld me this week My favorite is milk production in Bangladesh which according  one academic study explains 99 percent of movements in the SP 500 Its true the sck market has done better under Democratic presidents than Republican ones he said But is that just a spurious correlation In all likelihood it isI hear all the time that the market has gone crazy since the election Mr Malkiel continued Is the market o high now I have no idea and neither does anyone else Ive been around a long time One thing I can tell you for sure is that nobody and I mean nobody can consistently time the marketAt the same time he doesnt consider it irrational that the market has surged since Mr Trumps electionPeople who think Trump is going  take us over a cliff dont have any superior knowledge he said Maybe hell do something really stupid on trade and the economy will go over a cliff Its a possibility But its also a possibility that were going  have stronger economic growth My own view is that were going  have better real growth in 2017 than 2016 maybe not 4 percent but 3 percent absolutely Its not completely nonsensical for the market  be upSo what should invesrs  of whatever political leanings  do nowMr Stack said he was telling clients  be cautious not because of any views about a Trump presidency but because valuations are getting stretched and the bull market is now the secondlongest in the last 85 yearsThat makes me nervous he said One thing Ive learned over 40 years of investing is that profit opportunities always come around if youre patient Dont be lured in because youre afraid the Dow is going through 20000 and youll be left behind There is no last train out of the stationMr Malkiel urged invesrs  ignore their feelings about a Trump presidency Whether you think Trump will be wildly successful or hell be a disaster dont try  move in or out of assets because you think you know whats going  happen Mr Malkiel advised He said invesrs should be broadly diversified stick  their asset allocation plans and rebalance periodically And  all means keep expenses lowNext up on the calendar the socalled Santa Claus rally which posits that scks tend  rise during the last five trading days of the calendar year and the first two trading days of the next and if they dont its a harbinger of bad timesAs Yale Hirsch described the phenomenon If Santa Claus would fail  call bears may come  Broad and WallThat o proved wildly off base last yearCollapse,business
OpEd ContriburPresident Trump has been saberrattling against sanctuary jurisdictions since the early days of his campaign He and Atrney General Jeff Sessions have frequently threatened  withhold federal funding and even  jail local officials who refuse  help deport immigrants But until recently their talk was mostly just that talkThis framing has been so effective that the news media has been repeating the analogy without significant scrutiny The comparison between the two lawsuits however is as flawed as it is simpleTo understand why one needs  understand exactly what sanctuary laws do They draw their name from the sanctuary movement of the 1980s During that period Central American refugees were routinely denied asylum because the United States government supported the regimes from which they had fled In the face of this injustice some religious leaders ok steps  actively prevent federal immigration officers from arresting and deporting these vulnerable immigrants It was at times a form of civil disobedienceTodays sanctuary laws while bearing the same name are markedly different California and the hundreds of other places across the country with such laws and policies have done nothing whatsoever  actively interfere with federal immigration enforcement efforts Rather the defining characteristic of these laws is their passivity They do not direct state officers  take any steps  interfere with federal enforcement efforts Instead they dictate that the local police and state officers simply do not assist in the federal governments deportation agenda  that they do nothingThis may sound like an overly formal distinction since both efforts have made it harder for the federal government  deport people To be sure the decision of local and state officials not  lend their resources  immigration enforcement efforts means that either there will be fewer deportations or the deportations will be more expensive for the federal government This is one reason these laws have so rankled Mr Trump and Mr SessionsThe Justice Department lawsuit emphasizes that immigration is a federal matter that we must have a uniform scheme  oversee it and that this scheme is being undermined  sanctuary laws In most states federal immigration authorities are able  leverage state and local criminal justice systems The Justice Department is arguing that Californias refusal  participate requires it  adapt and employ different enforcement strategiesIt is fair  ask whether states should have the power  abstain from federal law enforcement programs that they view as immoral or adverse  their local interests It is not however a new questionIt is this principle that distinguishes Californias decision  opt out of deportation efforts from Arizonas decision  opt inThe Justice Department is correct that the regulation of immigration is a federal matter Thats why the Supreme Court made clear in the Arizona case that states may not insert themselves in immigration enforcement  directing its officers  arrest people on immigration charges California far from inserting itself has extracted itself from federal immigration enforcement efforts in precisely the same way that the sheriffs in Printz extracted themselves from the federal effort  regulate the purchase of firearmsAtrney General Sessionss attempt  spin his attack on sanctuary laws as a logical extension of the Supreme Courts Arizona decision is a transparent attempt  sidestep the clear rule established in PrintzThis is precisely the type of legitimate justification for local abstention that the Supreme Court established as a bedrock principle of our federal system of government over two decades agoCollapse,business

As it stands now the proposed House tax bill would give the undeserving rich  legatees who will inherit multimillion dollar estates  a 1722 billion tax break over the next ten years In doing so the measure would further entrench the super rich a class that in recent years has acquired a growing share of both income and wealthJason Furman a professor of economics at Harvards Kennedy School who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2013  2017 emailed his response  my inquiry about the impact of the bill on households with different incomesThe House tax bill would lead  substantial redistribution from the middleclass  highincome households Moreover the particular form of the highincome tax cuts is designed  reward and perpetuate wealth in several respects Much of the corporate rate cut would provide a windfall for the returns on capital investments that have already been made ing forward much of the effect of the plan would be  reduce the tax on monopoly rents  often  negative effective rates which means taxpayers would be subsidizing corporationsestate tax repeal would have eliminated This would mean that not only are estates not taxed but that much of capital gains could permanently escape taxation substantially increasing dynastic wealth accumulationWhile proposing  eliminate the estate tax algether the House bill would retain a provision in current law  the stepup in basis  that effectively wipes out all tax liability for heirs on the increased value of assets at the time of death Forbes declared this is a tax cut for the rich and described what would happen using the stepup in basis if you died with an estate that had grown in value from 10 million  100 millionThere would be no estate tax and your heirs could sell the sck right after your death and owe no capital gains taxes on the 90 million gainMany of the very richest Americans have children who stand  benefit enormously if the proposed tax bill is enacted The list of these billionaires includes Mark Zuckerberg Michael Bloomberg Larry Ellison Charles Koch Sergey Brin Larry  Phil Knight Carl Icahn Pierre Omidyar David Koch Warren Buffett Bill Gates Steve Ballmer Sheldon Adelson Michael Dell Jeff Bezos George Soros and of course Donald Trumprepealing the tax would give about 330 estates which are each worth more than 50 million each a tax cut averaging more than 20 million compared  current lawThe estatetax provisions in the proposed bill are explicitly designed  help preserve and protect the assets of the wealthiest Americans And despite their stated purpose the corporate tax breaks in the legislation will not encourage new investment according  many economists but will instead reduce the taxes due on existing investmentsAlan Krueger a professor of economics at Princen who was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 2011  2013 put the case against the Republican tax bill succinctly in an emailSeveral components of the House bill favor physical and financial capital over labor and human capital  namely the lower rate for passive pass through income the repeal of the estate tax the big cut in the corporate tax rate the failure  end the carried interest loophole etc At the same time the tax on university endowments and treatment of grad student fellowships will slow human capital investmentIf enacted these features of the proposal would also deepen and further entrench existing class divisions and reduce economic mobilityOne of the biggest obstacles facing critics of the tax bill is that laws governing taxation are extremely complex The description of the bill  the Joint Committee on Taxation is 299pages long and it details only the bills provisions without any discussion of possible economic consequences Crucial provisions governing arcane but crucial matters like carried interest stepup in basis passthrough corporations and passive investments are inherently opaqueIn an effort  inform the public the Joint Committee and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center have released charts and analyses explaining who benefits and who loses  income class Both the committee and the center challenge Republican claims that the main goal of the legislation is  give the middle class a tax breakThe largest cuts in dollars and as a percentage of aftertax income would accrue  higherincome households However not all taxpayers would receive a tax cut under this proposal  at least 7 percent of taxpayers would pay higher taxes under the proposal in 2018 and at least 25 percent of taxpayers would pay more in 2027By 2027 the center found those in the botm two quintiles would on average get very modest annual cuts of 10 and 40 those in the third fourth and fifth quintiles would get average cuts of 320 710 and 3860 Those in the p 1 percent would get a 52780 tax cut and those in the p 01 percent a 278370 cutIn other words the Trump tax bill contrary  the presidents populist spin is a classic trickledown proposal concentrating  far the largest share of benefits on corporations and the richThe most expensive parts of the tax bill are a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35  20 percent with lost revenues taling 146 trillion over ten years along with a fiveyear provision letting corporations immediately write off the entire cost of capital investments instead of depreciating them over several years with an additional revenue loss of 842 billionLarry Summers a professor of economics at Harvard who served as secretary of the Treasury from 1999  2001 argues along with a number of other economists that the combination of the rate cut and the immediate writeoff of investments  known as expensing  amounts  a very highcost expenditure that produces very little social benefitWhat is the compelling case for cutting the corporate rate  20 per cent Under the proposed plan for at least five years businesses will be able  write off investments in new equipment entirely in the year they are made So the government is sharing  an equal extent in the costs of and the returns from investment eliminating any tax induced disincentive  invest The effective tax rate on new investment is reduced  zero or less before even considering the corporate rate reduction Corporate rate reduction serves only  reward monopoly profits other rents or past investments After the trends of the past few years are shareholders really the most worthy recipients of a windfallif corporations can immediately write off new investments for equipment then the corporate rate cut on those investments amounts  only a windfall gain cutting taxes on returns  old investment With expensing corporations that use debt financing with tax deductible interest payments end up getting tax rebates  cover some of the costs of new investments regardless of the statury tax rateSo what must you do or whom must you be  get the 25 rate First you get it for 100 of your net business income from passive activities which generally are business activities in which you personally do not materially participate This typically applies  people who invest money in all kinds of partnerships S corporation activities et cetera that engage in pretty much any type of businessShaviro calls this obscure set of provisions in the tax bill a weapon  enhance plucracy  offering the biggest rate cut  millionaires allowing those who are in effect rentiers  get the low 25 percent rate on all their incomePassthrough income would be taxed at no more than 25 percent far below the 396 percent p individual income tax rate that now applies  passthrough income or the p 35 p rate that would apply  individual income under the GOP plan This would provide a massive windfall  the very wealthyThis section of the bill has been nicknamed the Trump loophole  the centerbecause Donald Trump exemplifies the type of business owner whom it would most benefitWe dont know how much Trump collects in such income which has become passive for him since he put his children in charge of his enterprises rather than running them himself But given that he seems  have stakes in at least 500 passthrough entities it looks like reducing his rate  25 percent from 396 percent would save him a n of moneyDitch the passthrough break the one that taxes income of partnerships and other businesses organized in forms other than corporations at a rate lower than it taxes wages This is a compliance and complexity nightmare Theres no economic reason  apply lower tax rates on businesses based on how they are organized no justification  tax entrepreneurial income differently based on how it is earned and no way  differentiate between one form of business activity and other without onerous rules and intrusive auditsFor political reasons Looney argues Republicans should eliminate the break help avoid the caricature of tax cuts for the rich No form of income is more concentrated among pincome taxpayers than passthrough business income and the reduced rate would only benefit taxpayers in the highest two brackets eg married taxpayers earning over 260000Collapse,business

Common SenseAt age 67 Thomas C Davis should be enjoying all the perks of a long and distinguished career at the pinnacle of Wall Street and the Texas business elite These include golfing at the prestigious Dallas Country Club and Presn Trail lf Club where he was a member trips  Las Vegas and golf urnaments on the private jet he coowned and fractional ownership of two professional sports teams the Texas Rangers and the Dallas StarsWhat he faces instead is the prospect of 20 years or more in federal prison and millions of dollars in finesLast month Mr Davis pleaded guilty  12 felonies for a brazen insider trading scheme in which he leaked a stream of confidential information about the Dallasbased Dean Foods while he served as the companys chairmanWhen questioned  agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 2014 and lawyers from the Securities and Exchange Commission last year he lied compounding his securities fraud  committing perjury And after the FBI agents left he ok a prepaid cellular phone he had used  leak the information and threw it in a creek near his Dallas home destroying evidence and obstructing justiceMr Daviss crimes have received relatively little attention in part because of the blaze of publicity that accompanied the flamboyant professional sports gambler William T Walters who was accused of being his coconspirar and the threetime Masters golf champion Phil Mickelson Mr Mickelson wasnt charged but netted nearly 1 million from the Dean Foods tips and agreed  forfeit the proceeds plus interestMr Walters pleaded not guilty last week  10 felony countsWhat led  Mr Daviss actions His plea hearing coupled with the SEC and criminal complaints and interviews with people who know him offer some cluesFor one thing Mr Davis was so desperate for money he even ok from a charity According  the SEC Mr Davis ran a charity that raised money for a Dallas shelter for battered women and children The charity tax records show was Shelter lf Inc which held an annual oneday proam golf urnament at Presn Trail  benefit Genesis Womens Shelter  Support The event typically raised over 400000 and after expenses contributed about 300000 a year  GenesisMr Davis was a copresident and trustee of Shelter lf the golf legend Lanny Wadkins was one of five other trustees According  the SEC in August 2011 Mr Davis ld his assistant  write him a check for 100000 on the charitys account which he then used  cover an overdraft in his personal checking account of 80000This 100000 check resulted in a significant shortfall in the amount available for donation  the battered womens shelter the SEC said in its complaint Davis first delayed the charitys donation  the shelter and later wrote a check for a partial amount only after prompting  the shelter leader and promising another 100000  the end of the shelters fiscal yearMr Davis eventually repaid the 100000 using money he had obtained as part of the insider trading schemeMany of his former colleagues on Wall Street were stunned  the charges against the distinguished whitehaired Mr Davis a Harvard Business School graduate and a Navy veteran who in contrast  Mr Walters and Mr Mickelson both known gamblers was seen as a pillar of the business establishmentIn addition  his long tenure on the Dean Foods board culminating in being named chairman in 2013 Mr Davis served on at least nine other corporate boards including Trin Energy Suiza Foods and the Dallasbased Colonial Bank now owned  BBT Financial He was chief executive of the Concorde Group and a founder of Bluffview Capital both investment firmsBefore that he was a managing partner at Donaldson Lufkin  Jenrette where he was head of banking and corporate finance for the southwestern United States and handled many mergers and acquisitions He left after Credit Suisse acquired the firm in 2001He of all people should have known betterBut the annals of insider trading are filled with people who knew better from Ivan Boesky  Rajat Gupta Whats perplexing is their motives Like Mr Davis they were already rich and successful beyond most peoples dreamsAt his plea hearing last month Mr Davis said he knew that his actions were wrong and unlawful but otherwise shed little light on why he turned  insider trading But clearly he needed money despite his years of bonuses as a highly paid investment banker and his lucrative direcrs feesAccording  the SECs complaint  April 2010 Mr Davis was in desperate financial straits He owed the IRS 78000 His brokerage account was heavily margined and he had run up tens of thousands in credit card debt He owed 550000  one of his investment fundsMr Davis sought salvation in gambling and in Mr Walters whom he met decades earlier on a golf course The two often played gether especially when they were both living in Southern California The insider trading scheme began around June 2008 when Mr Davis tipped Mr Walters  Dean Foods coming earningsIt isnt clear who came up with the idea but Mr Walters an active invesr often expressed an interest in how Dean Foods was doing There was no explicit agreement for Mr Davis  share in any proceeds from Mr Walterss trading Rather as Mr Davis put it at his plea hearing I expected that I would receive personal benefits in the form of business opportunities and a potential source of capitalAs Professor Coffee put it This is a perfect example of a favor bank which is exactly how Wall Street worksHowever vague the terms of their deal they clearly knew that what they were doing was wrong Mr Walters gave Mr Davis a prepaid cellular phone for use when conveying inside information and ld him  use the code Dallas Cowboys when referring  Dean Foods the government assertedMr Davis finally came knocking in April 2010 when he met with Mr Walters in Las Vegas and asked for money Mr Walters arranged a loan of 625000 which solved the immediate demands of the IRS and his investment firmBut his spending continued In just one month March 2011 Mr Davis ran up gambling losses of 200000 at one Las Vegas casino He owed 178000 for the private jet And he had  cover the 100000 he had taken from the charity The overdraft had occurred when the casino cashed in his markers after Mr Davis failed  make good on the gambling lossesThis time Mr Walters guaranteed a 400000 line of credit for Mr Davis who promptly drew down 350000 of it And Mr Davis repaid Mr Walterss 625000 loan with interestMr Davis ultimately received over 1 million in loans from Mr Walters most never repaid As it turned out that was a pittance compared  the 43 million in profit Mr Walters reportedly reaped from Mr Daviss tips  a sum Mr Davis learned of only in the course of the investigation Despite Mr Daviss reputation as a skilled deal maker that will surely rank as one of the worst insider trading deals in hisry and it may help explain why Mr Davis is now cooperating with the government against Mr WaltersA lawyer for Mr Davis Thomas M Melsheimer at Fish  Richardson in Dallas declined  commentThe government has shed little light on Mr Daviss motive other than that he needed money The SEC said he did little  adjust his expensive lifestyle after leaving Credit Suisse in 2001 He experienced a sharp drop in his income went through an expensive divorce soon after and suffered big investment reversals during the 2008 financial crisisNone of that is a crime Mr Davis is hardly alone in trying  maintain the illusion of wealth and prosperity even as his personal finances veered out of controlBut after a lifetime of success Mr Davis was o proud and o embarrassed  admit any of this and turn  his wealthy friends and fellow golf club members though many would have been willing  help according  a person close  him This person and others insisted on anonymity because the situation involved a pending criminal matterSome people would risk anything rather than suffer that kind of personal embarrassment Professor Coffee said And once youve decided youre willing  risk anything you can get in deep deep troubleCollapse,business

Common SenseOne of my fondest childhood memories is of my familys annual holiday trip  St Louis  see the department sre windows I was transfixed  the corner window at FamousBarr where model trains wound their way through a larinth of tunnels and bridges in a snowcovered mountain landscapeEven after a decadeslong decline of Americas urban centers as shopping meccas New York remains a redoubt of holiday tradition The Macys Thanksgiving Day Parade officially kicks off the Christmas shopping season and elaborate department sre windows are still a major draw for uristsIt would be a public relations disaster  eliminate them he said But he added I suspect theyll quietly cut back spend less become less elaborate And theyll disappear when the companies themselves eventually disappearIts hard  fault struggling retailers for trying  recoup some of the cost but part of the windows allure has always been that they were pure fantasies untainted  any overtly commercial appeal Those days seem  have passedAt Lord  Taylor this years windows are cobranded  the Hallmark Channel which is promoting its Countdown  Christmas holiday programming Farther upwn the windows at Saks Fifth Avenue not only carry the Mastercard logo but the Snow White theme on display is basically a plug for the Walt Disney Company which said it had entered a promotional partnership with Saks for the windows To both sres credit there are no paid product placements in the windows a trend that has infected some other holiday windows in the cityThe crowds jostling  see Lord  Taylors displays used  be so large that ropes were deployed  maintain an orderly flow But when I spped  this week the pedestrians on Fifth Avenue were rushing  and few paused  take a look No ropes were needed Down the street the repurposed B Altman department sre which now houses the City University of New Yorks Graduate Center sat like a hulking ghost of Christmas pastStill there was plenty of greenery and lots of twinkling lights on the Lord  Taylor facade and holiday music wafted over the sidewalk The windows themselves were charming although less elaborate than the ones I remembered from years past Saks also featured an impressive fullfacade light show after dusk Its windows were attracting somewhat larger crowds during the day when I spped Tiffany Bourre a spokeswoman for Hudsons Bay the parent company of Lord  Taylor and Saks assured me the sale of the Lord  Taylor building  WeWork would not affect the window displays in the future and that the company was committed  the sres rich hisry of holiday traditions After the sale Lord  Taylor will still occupy some of the building She said that the holiday windows and light show at Saks would continue for years  comeHudsons Bay does not break out the cost of the window displays but they are expensive Ms Bourre said the Lord  Taylor windows were created  nearly 75 artists craftsmen and engineers who put in more than 35000 hours on the project She did not try  justify the expense in purely economic terms The holiday windows are considered a gift  the city she saidMr Cohen said he got all kinds of grief from executives at Federated Department Sres after he spent over 100000  renovate the holiday windows at the flagship Lazarus department sre in downwn Columbus Ohio in the early 1990s at the time he was chairman and chief executive of Lazarus then a division of FederatedThe window displays and holiday traditions were never overtly commercial said Jan Whitaker the author of Service and Style How the American Department Sre Fashioned the Middle Class and other books about department sres In their heyday they did a lot of things that werent directly linked  salesThe goal was  attract people  the sres with amenities like tearooms restaurants fashion shows and even nurseries But the rise of Walmart and other discount chains in the mid1960s Ms Whitaker said drove a stake in the heart of the downwn sres As shoppers focused on price above all else and oldline sres moved  the suburbs she added The department sres dispensed with just about everything  the displays the decorations the free gift wrap and alterations the free deliveryIt now seems ironic Ms Whitaker continued that department sres were once criticized for overcommercializing Christmas with their window displays A religious revival in the mid1950s she said prompted a shortlived focus on angels carolers and manger scenes The department sres created a magical sense of occasion she said Families came and brought their children Years later they wouldnt remember the gifts they got in any given year but they remembered the windows Those children became future cusmersShopping now she said is not an experienceIts just about buying something at the lowest price she said  I find it kind of depressing but theres no point in wallowing in nostalgiaMr Cohen agreed Weve crossed the Rubicon in gross commercialism he said There used  be an almost spiritual sense of kinship that giftgiving and gathering gether enhanced and the sre displays and marketing tried  embrace that Now the holiday is just the trigger for an extreme state of acquisitiveness Holiday dcor and atmosphere just get in the way of thatFor holiday purists its an ominous sign that traditional department sres are getting battered  the sck market As of this week Hudsons Bay shares were down nearly 20 percent for the year Macys sck was down about 28 percent Both companies have attracted activist invesrs who have been pushing  use their real estate holdings  raise money They have shown scant interest in maintaining expensive holiday traditionsBy comparison shares in Best Buy one of the few success sries among brickandmortar retailers have gained nearly 56 percent this year Best Buy has withsod the combined onslaught of Amazon and Walmart  focusing relentlessly on price product selection technical support and internet sales and marketing It spends almost nothing on traditional holiday attractionsA visit  the new Nordstrom Rack sre just south of Herald Square may be a vision of Christmas future Under the glare of unadorned florescent lights it might as well have been JanuaryI cant possibly imagine these traditions ever coming back Ms Whitaker saidThe FamousBarr sre I visited as a child was rebranded after Macys bought its parent company the

older people who write their life sries Ms Bick found some peace in looking back Writing is painful because it brings back memories she said in a recent interview But when she began writing Ms Bick said she recognized that there was this joyous little girl whom she could finally reclaim And she described an awe that I survived some of the things I went throughMs Bick who has three children and three grandchildren considers her sries a gift  future generations  and  past ones I am keeping my parents and grandparents alive she said And as an egotist I am keeping myself alive I am

Late last year Tom Nichols a professor at the Naval War College and a NeverTrump conservative proposed a little thought experiment for Republicans skeptical of Robert Muellers investigation of the Trump campaigns Russia tiesLets play Alternate Universe he wrote on Twitter Its 2017 and President Hillary Clinn is facing charges that Chelsea met with Russians who offered oppo on Trump Chelsea didnt call the FBI and Clinn nat sec adviser Jake Sullivan lied  the FBI about talking  the RussiansIm sure  tally sure  Nichols added with no little irony that stalwarts of the GOP would say Look this is a nothingburger you cant define collusion its just the coffee boy and on and onIm reminded of Nichols astute tweets as the Republican campaign against the Russia investigation kicked in higher gear this weekAt the State of the Union on Tuesday night Trump was overheard telling Representative Jeff Duncan Republican of South Carolina that he was 100 percent committed  releasing House Committee Intelligence Chairman Devin Nuness secret memo on the Russia investigation over fierce FBI objections regarding material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracyNext there was the aheadofschedule departure of Deputy FBI Direcr Andrew McCabe after relentless public criticism from Trump McCabe was politically suspect because his wife a Democrat made a failed bid in 2015 for the Virginia State Senate and had received money from thenv and Clinn ally Terry McAuliffes politicalaction committeeAnd finally there was House Speaker Paul Ryan who on Tuesday supported the release of the Nunes memo  clean up the FBI If the administration and its supporters get their way the cleaning would also claim Deputy Atrney General Rod Rosenstein who appointed Mueller and apparently approved the continued surveillance of the former Trump campaign adviser and Vladimir Putin fan Carter Algether this is supposed  tell the tale of deep state collusion against our elected leader So lets play Alternate Universe again and bring Nichols scenarios updateImagine that President Hillary Clinn had agreed  release a partisan Democratic intelligence memo over the objections of Republicans in Congress and her own p FBI officials that disclosure could harm national securityWould conservative pundits and politiciansa Praise President Clinn for abandoning her old habits of secrecy and standing strong on the side of transparency in governmentb Call for her impeachment on grounds that she had compromised national security for shamelessly selfserving political reasonsImagine next that the Clinn campaign had named as a foreign policy adviser a little known figure with scanty business or academic credentials but with strongly proPutin views and curious links  senior Russian officials Imagine that this same adviser later testified  Congress that the Clinn campaign had asked him  sign a nondisclosure agreement after a trip he ok  Russia during the height of the campaign Imagine also that senior Clinn campaign officials at first denied and later had their memories refreshed about knowing himWould conservative pundits and politiciansa Agree with Clinn administration spokespersons that while the campaign had named him as an adviser he had no role in anything and that his links  Russia were purely incidentalb Agree with Democrats in Congress that the FBI had no business whatsoever in surveilling him because a political dossier might have served as one basis of suspicion and that his civil liberties had been seriously traducedc Note that his presence on the campaign was of a piece with Clinns disastrous reset of relations with Russia under the Obama administration and that it suggested a policy of appeasing the Kremlin at Americas expenseImagine finally that after firing James Comey for insufficient loyalty President Clinn had asked the deputy direcr of the FBI how he had voted in the election in an Oval Office meeting Imagine that after learning that he hadnt voted she unleashed a campaign of public invective and belittlement aimed at his wife for having once run for state office as a Republican Imagine in this same connection that the effort  oust the deputy direcr was only a warmup  getting rid of the deputy atrney general a wellregarded straightshooting Democrat who had appointed the special counsel looking in Clinns Russia tiesWould conservative pundits and politiciansa Applaud President Clinn for taking a belated but necessary step  clean up a politicized Justice Department that had interfered against her at the end of the campaign while also agreeing that the party affiliation of an FBI officials spouse is a legitimate basis  suspect the official of disloyalty and partisan motivesb Cast aspersions on the deputy atrney general for defending the work of the special counsel against the wishes of the presidentc Accuse the president of obstructing justice  smearing and effectively ousting upstanding public servants whose only sin was  do their jobs  the best of their abilities while in one case being married  a woman with political ambitionsIn this same alternative universe Id be writing columns calling for further investigations of a manifestly corrupt Clinn administration and even raising the subject of impeachment I know because I was there for the prequel back in 1998 At least some of the conservatives who railed against Bill Clinn then could claim they were acting on principles that went beyond pure partisanshipThese days not so muchCollapse,business
OpEd ContribursThe extraordinary rise in the value of Bitcoin and other crypcurrencies has led many people  worry that this market is a giant bubble Many including the Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen and the billionaire invesr Warren Buffett have warned about a Bitcoin bust that could rival the dotcom crash of 2000 and wipe out specularsBut the bigger concern about crypcurrencies may be the damage they could do in the long run  government finances through lost tax revenueThe core technology underlying crypcurrencies known as blockchain is premised on anonymity Transactions are public but linked only  an electronic address This is a big part of what makes blockchain attractiveBut anonymity is also the main fuel for the underground economy which is now conducted largely via cash The underground economy is a significant source of lost tax revenue The Internal Revenue Service estimates that it loses around 500 billion annually because of unreported wages alone And the underground economy in the United States  estimated at 84 percent of output  is relatively small compared with those of other countriesIf crypcurrencies were  replace cash as the preferred anonymous medium of exchange they could significantly expand the underground economy because they are so much more convenient than cash There is no need  visit an ATM and you can securely pay people regardless of their location No wonder Steven Mnuchin the Treasury secretary expressed concerns recently that Bitcoin could become the next Swiss bank accountThe IRS understands this which is why it has been pushing  break the anonymity of crypcurrencies In November it persuaded a federal judge  order Coinbase a popular Bitcoin exchange  reveal the identity of the cusmers for more than 14000 accounts representing nearly nine million transactionsBlockchain technologies can also make it difficult for the IRS  tax crypcurrency trading profits Here is a simple tax dodge that would be hard for the IRS  prove Suppose A B and C are electronic addresses you own You let the IRS know you own A but not B and C You buy one Bitcoin at 15000 and park it at A expecting the price  go up Just a few hours later when a Bitcoin is worth 15500 you send that Bitcoin  B and then  CA few months later when your Bitcoin is now worth 25000 you send it from C  A and tell the IRS I sold a Bitcoin  an anonymous counterparty at B back at 15500 and just now bought a Bitcoin from another anonymous counterparty at C for 25000 As a result you owe taxes on capital gains of just 500 rather than 10000The IRS can observe all the transactions between A B and C on the Bitcoin blockchain but it cannot disprove that B and C are arms length counterparties that is independent and not colluding Rules in the United States that require financial institutions  verify the identity of address holders do not solve the problem because as far as the IRS knows B and C could have been set up  a foreign institution that does not comply with such rulesIt is inconceivable that the government would simply accept enormous revenue losses from a larger underground economy and from tax dodges on trading profits The only question is how heavyhanded the response would beOne approach would be for the government  accept the difficulty of directly taxing crypcurrency transactions and  offset the revenue losses  raising tax rates The basic economics of taxation tells us that the economic losses from taxes increase exponentially with the tax rate so this response would transform revenue losses in a lower gross domestic productMore likely the United States would take a ugher approach and attempt  ban crypcurrencies This solution throws the ba out with the bath water While crypcurrencies open opportunities for tax evasion and illegal operations they also offer drastic reductions in the cost of financial transactions especially for the poor and less reliance on banks which can increase the power of the Federal Reserve  control money supply and reduce the risk of bank runsA smarter response would be for the government  switch from taxing income when it is received  taxing income when it is spent Many economists support moving  this kind of consumption tax but it would require a major overhaul of the tax codeThe prospect of substantial government revenue losses is not just a problem for the United States government it is also a problem for the crypcurrencies themselves For crypcurrencies  survive long enough  be an effective means of performing everyday transactions the crypcurrency community will need  find a way  prevent tax evasion This will involve a tricky balancing act preserving anonymity while providing the IRS with sufficient information  prevent tax evasionMore generally cracking down on tax evasion will require that the community learn  trust government Since this goes against the very ethos of the crypcurrency movement it poses the most difficult  but no less necessary  challengeRichard Holden is a professor of economics at the business school of the University of New South Wales Anup Malani is a law professor at the University of ChicagoCollapse,business
Investigars believe a man in Arizona was distributing performanceenhancing drugs on a global scale yet no charges have been filed His clientele included pro athletesOn Aug 25 2015 a Swiss postal inspecr reached in the river of 300000 parcels that pour in that nation every day and for a routine inspection plucked out two packages arriving from Arizona Inspecrs unwrapped them and found serried rows of bottlesThe bottles were suspected of containing performanceenhancing drugs so they were shipped  an antidoping laborary for testing Chemists discovered three synthetic compounds that are illicit gold for cheating athletes One sped the healing of tendons and ligaments Another helped build muscle mass A third stimulated the body  burn fatThe Swiss authorities notified the organization in the United States that investigates sports doping the United States AntiDoping Agency and shared the returnaddress sticker The packages were shipped  someone named Thomas MannHis name drew puzzled shrugs from Usada investigars That name had never crossed their radar and they could not find a home listing for someone with that name in their database in Arizona or anywhere elseThe name was then sred in the organizations computer system and largely forgotten until it resurfaced in a different context several months later triggering an intense pursuit of Thomas Mann and an aggressive investigation of his enterprise that involved federal law enforcement as well as antidoping officialsThe existence of the investigation and its extraordinary findings have not been previously reportedInvestigars believe what they uncovered was a trafficker who sat at the center of one of the broadest sports doping networks in American hisry with tendrils that extended  Europe and Asia In one year he shipped parcels containing performanceenhancing drugs  more than 8000 people they determined His substance of choice was peptides a newly popular though banned substance among athletes that is essentially a building block for proteinHis clientele included a dozen pro football players and coaches pro baseball players and a major league batting coach and p track and field athletes There were Olympians and potential Olympians from discus throwers  sprinters  polevaulters  weight lifters  wrestlersInvestigars assembled what they considered a hay pile of incriminating evidence surveillance video of the man making the shipments invoices and payment receipts email messages and testimony from several athletes who purchased drugs from him that corroborated the nature of his businessYet the dealer has not faced criminal charges He distributed drugs that inhabit a hazy gray zone Prosecurs generally treat the possession of peptides which are illegal without a medical prescription as a misdemeanorInvestigars also determined something else The mans name was not Thomas Mann His real name was Michael A Moorcones and he had left the faintest of footprints Born in Virginia he was a lawyer with no law office a distribur of sports drugs with no formal training as a pharmacistI set out  find Moorcones I drove 30 miles south of Phoenix  Queen Creek Ariz where suburbs expire in sunblasted desert and the Superstition Mountains rise gray and jagged I rang a doorbell in a subdivision A balding middleaged man opened the doorMichael MoorconesHe nodded YesIm a reporter I ld him and athletes tell me they purchased your performanceenhancing drugs They say your substances help them outtrain and outperform athletes who compete cleanCan we talkMoorcones offered a hint of a chuckle I wouldnt be interested in ever talking  anybody about anything OKHe moved  close the doorAn intriguing name was tucked in the Al Jazeera documentary Underground chemists spoke with reverence of a Svengali who produced and sold them highquality sports drugs His name was Thomas MannA chemist explained in the documentary how fastidious he had  be when ordering performanceenhancing drugs from Mann If you even use the wrong language with him saying Oh Im going  use this right away boom youd be kicked offTom carries it and is the only guy I trust  deliver actual peptides and not useless vials read oneHis business model according  investigars was clever They believe he operated the DatBTrue forum a go place for savvy discussion of peptides When an athlete on the forum would inquire about obtaining peptides Moorcones using a different name would steer the athlete  Thomas Mann So he was sending potential cusmers  himselfMoorcones in the guise of Thomas Mann or Tom Mann would then rigorously vet the cusmers  make sure they were who they claimed  be and would be trustworthy clientsIn the one year that Moorcones was under investigation he had 1 million in salesMoorconess business was a raging river in a much larger doping ecosystem The demand for performanceenhancing drugs extends  every corner of professional and amateur sports and well beyond Name any sport and chances are good that someone playing it has been caught doping in the past few monthsThen there are wealthy users who flock  antiaging medical clinics in search of youthful elixirs They find docrs who will prescribe peptides and human growth hormone The patients take all of these in hopes of adding muscle mass smoothing wrinkles and reclaiming body definition and sexual vitalityMoorcones served both ends of this market from athletes  the aging All came  his online forum in search of the latest wonder drugMoorcones purported that his products were intended for lab use only In a 2014 email he wrote I have the following batches available for in vitro purposes only Peptides Modified GRF 129 2mg  35vial 3110 vials But a cursory reading of his cusmers online comments indicated that they were not being used that wayDr Todd B Nippoldt an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn spoke  the scientific and health consequences of unregulated and illegal useThese people are carrying out quite sophisticated experiments on themselves at doses that far exceed anything in a lab Nippoldt said Its quite remarkable and dangerousThe original wonder drug of sports doping was steroids and it remains the gold standard for athletic cheaters There is nothing docrs and athletes say quite like the musclefiring boost provided  synthetic tessteroneThen testing for steroids improved and some sports ughened their rules against doping Steroids became a riskier play But that did not sp cheating Block one back alley and sophisticated chemists scurry down another The aim always is  find ways  build muscle mass burn fat aid recovery and increase the ability of the body  expand its aerobic capacity This underground world soon turned its eyes ward human growth hormones and peptides strings of amino acids and the building blocks of proteinsThe Al Jazeera documentary underlined that peptides had become a prime ingredient in a cheaters performance cocktail The documentary caught Taylor Teagarden a major league catcher saying on hidden camera that he had taken peptides and never been caught Major League Baseball remedied that oversight and suspended Teagarden for 80 games a few months after the documentary was releasedDr Robert Salvari an expert on growth hormone at Johns Hopkins noted that athletes were quite shrewd about the effects that drugs have on their bodies Hisry demonstrates that they often recognize the performanceboosting power before the medical community doesIt ok scientists until 1996  prove the muscleboosting powers of steroids  which athletes knew years earlier he said We are running way behindA lean and muscular fellow Bidlow described for me how he came  use peptides He had been a sprinter at Grand Canyon University in 2015 when he sustained a hamstring injury He was no potential Olympian He simply wanted  run a few more races so he asked around at elite gyms for a quick doping fixI had always been around people who used peptides and HGH he said although he declined  name names It sounded like peptides are supereffectivePlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersHe wrote down the names of suppliers He found a lot of fast talkers who excited no trust The head of Switzerlands antidoping organization ld me that his agencys tests have shown that 80 percent of the peptides advertised on the web are adulterated or outright fakesThen Bidlow learned of Thomas Manns site which was refreshingly professional And Manns peptides were real This wasnt bro science he is a pure brainiac Bidlow said He would post scientific studies breaking down how a peptide workedWe sat in a coffee shop as Bidlow gave me a turial on peptides He described which worked which were difficult  detect and which were not worth the trouble He said coaches and athletes  particularly sprinters  were enamored of something called insulinlike growth facr1 known as IGF1 It promotes healing and builds muscle in a fashion similar  anabolic steroids IGF1 occurs naturally in the body and antidoping tests struggle  distinguish the natural from the syntheticNo sprinter or baseball player has ever tested positive for IGF1 Do not take that  mean no sprinter or baseball player has ever used it they just havent been caughtThe antidoping world has occasional successes In 2015 and 2016 Dodgers pitcher Josh Ravin Indians outfielder Marlon Byrd and Braves pitcher Andrew McKirahan tested positive for peptides Major League Baseball suspended all of themFaced with the limits of testing technology antidoping officials and investigars have asked the Food and Drug Administration and Congress  tighten laws and crack down on peptides and growth hormoneFor Drug Enforcement Administration officials the problem lies with the weak wording of the laws that currently govern peptidesIf I catch you with heroin its a controlled substance and illegal  thats easy said Douglas W Coleman the special agent in charge of the DEAs Phoenix Division If I find human growth hormone I have  build a case  show that its significantly outside what it can be prescribed forPeptides are more difficult still Theres really no legal footholdThe FDA holds clearer regulary authority its officials could write ugher regulary language and crack down on peptides and growth hormone But agency investigars have paid scant attention  this black market I asked repeatedly and over many weeks  speak with an FDA official about the regulation of peptides and growth hormoneIn the end an agency spokeswoman sent a boilerplate emailThe FDA takes seriously its mission  protect the health of the American public wrote the spokeswoman Theresa Eisenman There are many complex facrs involved in how cases involving the sale or distribution of illegal products are investigated and ultimately prosecutedHer email cited three successful peptide prosecutions involving four people during the past three years Each of the offenders received a light punishmentSeeking a more detailed explanation I called a former p FDA official He spoke on condition of anonymity as he remains involved with these issues in the private secr He described the FDAs stance as defensible It has a small staff of about 200 agents and they focus on plagues like tainted and counterfeit drugs which endanger thousands of unsuspecting cusmers The societal impact of peptides and growth hormone is far less severe clearlyThe former official described the world of illicit peptide and hormones as caveat empr  buyer beware If rich patients and athletes are going  antiaging clinics or the web in search of unregistered drugs they know the risk he saidThe decision  downgrade prosecutions has all but decriminalized the mass distribution and use of powerful and untested drugs for athletesThat deeply frustrates those who are trying  stamp out chemical cheating  athletes Jeff Novitzky once served as a p investigar for the Food and Drug Administration and he was the lead investigar in the Bay Area Laborary Cooperative case in which he helped uncover doping  some of the biggest names in American sportsNovitzky now is a senior official with Ultimate Fighting Championship the mixedmartial arts circuit He is charged with cleaning up that sport and sees governmental footdragging everywhere he looksFor officials  complain that these are difficult highpressure prosecutions is a cowardly excuse Novitzky said The ease with which athletes teenagers anyone can purchase and buy these powerful hormonal substances is mindbogglingInvestigars discovered that Moorcones was shipping his products from a UPS sre wedged between a supermarket and real estate office on the suburban frontier of Queen Creek Video surveillance revealed that Moorconess septuagenarian parents often went with him  mail his parcelsEventually investigars obtained Moorconess cusmer list of more than 8000 names It was a rich hunting ground Investigars found the names of pro athletes and forwarded the information  their leaguesMajor League Baseball ended up suspending two minor leaguers The National Football League was another matter The Al Jazeera documentary had named six players as likely dopers and the NFL penalized not a single one The Moorcones investigation yielded more names which were shared with the league The NFL has penalized none of the playersTrack and field athletes weight lifters and wrestlers are another matter The United States AntiDoping Agency has jurisdiction over these sports and can punish athletes who violate doping procolsUsada handed down a raft of penalties  Moorconess cusmers Jason Young a 35yearold discus thrower and coach from Lubbock Tex who competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics was suspended as was Nick Mossberg a polevaulter who competed at the 2012 United States Olympic trials and planned  try again in 2016 The investigation also netted a wrestler from Colorado and a weight lifter who graduated from MITAll acknowledged ordering peptides from Tom Mann None of these athletes had tested positiveBidlow and Mossberg the polevaulter had worked and trained at Altis an elite athletic training campus in Phoenix Numerous Olympic athletes train there under the tutelage of coaches with global reputationsI called the recruiting direcr at Altis Andreas Behm who also coaches the sprinters and hurdlers Bidlow and Mossberg he said had simply gone rogue The elite training center he insisted had no larger problem with dopingThe investigation of Moorcones stalled last year The United States atrney in Phoenix had taken a hard look and given up because a federal agency  the FDA or the DEA  was not willing  bring a case His distribution of peptides they apparently decided was not worth prosecuting A lawyer for Moorcones demanded immunity for his clientMoorcones shut down his website and claimed online that he was ill Worried cusmers speculated that his own drugs had sickened him I feel for the guy one cusmer wrote The community of illegal experimental medicine is losing a true heroOther clients speculated correctly that Mann was under investigation they began  worry that their names had fallen in the hands of law enforcement They were correctMoorcones politely bid everyone goode Ive enjoyed serving everyone through the years he wrote on his Authentiquevie siteWithin months investigars noticed that one of Moorconess prominent highvolume cusmers had taken his business  a dealer in Florida where antiaging clinics peddling peptides and hormones grow like sugar cane Other clients turned  an oftinvestigated but still active peptide trafficker in LouisianaThere was still much investigars did not understand about Moorconess operation He distributed such massive volumes of illicit substances but they were never able  determine the source of the drugs Was he purchasing them from somewhere and reselling  athletes or was he somehow manufacturing them himself And were his parents aware of what they were shippingBack on the edge of the desert in Arizona I persuaded Moorcones  keep the door open another minute or two People all have their own agenda he ld meI allowed that this might be true Any sry grows more complicated when you hear both sides I said Why not tell me yoursHe smiled faintly I wouldnt be the person  give it  you anyway Thank youThis time Moorcones shut the door,business

The rush  enact the tax bill was designed  mask  as a break for the middle class  what is in fact a 14 trillion package of benefits for key donors and lobists the richest members of Congress President Trump his family and other families like hisThe authors cite a wide range of specific flaws but their main argument is that the measure is gravely deficient at its coreThe most serious structural problems with the bill are unavoidable outcomes of Congresss choice  preference certain taxpayers and activities while disfavoring others  and for no discernible policy rationale These haphazard lines are fundamentally unfair and inefficient and invite tax planning  sophisticated taxpayers  get within the preferred categoriesGlogower Kamin Kysar and Shanske argue that some of the most egregious loopholes and schemes permitted  the legislation are that individual taxpayerswill be able  shield their labor income from tax  simply setting up a corporation and having their income accrue in the form of corporate profits As a result income that would have been taxed at the high individual rates is instead taxed at the low corporate rateSecond the legislation creates a huge incentive for anyone in a position  do so  change his or her status from employee  independent contracr or a partner in a firm The game is clear Dont be an employee instead be an independent contracr or partner in a firm The ability  make this shift is available primarily  the wellpaidThe legislation according  Glogower and his colleagues also fails  present a coherent rationalethe fundamental problem is the lack of any underlying logic in deciding who benefits from the passthrough deductions and who does not Independent contracrs and partners benefit but not employees Why An owner of real estate through a REIT benefits but not the docr in the building Why An architect benefits in some ways that a lawyer does not And so onThe bill encourages tax evasion Glogower and his colleagues citeopportunities  use rate differentials and illconsidered transitions  engage in transactions that serve  basically pump money out of the Treasury and in the pockets of welladvised taxpayersTo provide an example they use a company that purchased equipment under existing law which provides them with tax breaks on the cost spread out over the years in a depreciation schedule The new law allows companies  immediately write off the full cost of buying equipment known as expensingSo the authors ask what does that meanIt means that old property can still get the benefit of expensing but only if it is sold  another party If the original owner holds it they have  depreciate according  the old rules if they sell it  another party then suddenly the full cost is eligible for expensing and the net effect is an immediate deduction of the existing tax basis of the asset The parties can split the resulting surplus It appears that the buyer of the asset could even lease it back  the existing owner so that the property doesnt even have  go anywhereI emailed some of the authors of this report for their individual thoughtsMitchell Kane a law professor at NYU wrote in response that the bill willcreate new incentives  shift tangible assets and jobs abroad Given President Trumps relentless message about US jobs it is incomprehensible  me that we are about  pass something that has this effect without any kind of meaningful discussion of the issueHe noted thatlower and middleincome families who are especially dependent upon inflationindexed deductions credits and bracket thresholds will feel the impact increasingly as time goes onIn the first year 2018 the changed inflation rate raises a relatively modest 315 billion but it grows every year reaching 37 billion in 2027 To be sure Hemel wrote this affects everyone  some degree but most of the burden is paid for  families in the botm four quintilesIn the long term Hemel arguedthis is a very subtle way  increase taxes on the lower and middle classes and then use those revenues  pay for a massive tax cut for corporationsThis fullspeedahead strategy simultaneously constrained the ability of the press  explore the special interest provisions buried in the legislationA tax expert who insisted on anonymity in order  protect client confidentiality emailed me his critique of the bill1 The corporate rate reduction is permanent for individuals only temporary Completely obnoxious In effect the money saved within the 10 year budget window  making those individual cuts temporary helped  underwrite the cost of making the corporatepass though side permanent2 Carried interest provision When Trump was careening around in his populist candidate mode he promised  end it Here is one campaign promise that he somehow failed  redeem when the clear and available chance presented itself3 Restriction on state and C local tax deduction  consciously vindictive imposition of double taxation on citizens of certain Democratic states corporations and pass through businesses the darlings of the Republicans still get  deduct those very same taxes in full4 Expanding the standard deduction but financing the cost of so doing  repealing the personal exemptions is a bit of a bait and switch maneuver Some people might be worse off5 In a bill in which 100s of billions of dollars were sloshing around  provide steep tax cuts for already wealthy and highly prosperous corporations and pass through businesses the Republicans could only find the will  raise the refundable portion of the child care tax credit from 1000  1400 Rubio wanted it  be raised  2000 and his Republican brethren refused  even meet him halfway Pitiful6 Deduction for extraordinary medical expenses  retention of this deduction did not even get the fiveyear sunset window applied  all the other individual tax provisions two years only Vicious7 Pass through business taxation  the bill is a massive tax gift  some of the wealthiest people in the country who are conducting business operations in noncorporate form or are invesrs in sameWhat amounted  three major pieces of legislation were approved  the full House and the Senate Finance Committee two weeks after the bill was unveiled without a single hearing on the 400pluspage legislation as Thomas Kaplan and Alan Rappeport put it in The TimesOne of our jobs is  flesh out competing views with such seriousness and respect that we should be mitigating not exacerbating the polarization that does exist od teachers dont shut down debate they try  model Socratic seriousness  putting the best possible construction on arguments even  and especially  if one doesnt hold those positionsfor a return  regular order letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts We wont settle all our differences that way but such an approach is more likely  make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents We might not like the compromises regular order requires but we can and must live with them if we are  find real and lasting solutionsSo far however only one Republican senar has suffered real costs for deciding  vote for the tax billNo way that Bob Corker is going  vote for a tax reform bill that I think in any way is going  add  the deficit Its not going  happen never Its never going  happen Never never everThis is the most passionate thing for me period that I work on Not foreign policy Not banking Its this deficit issueFor Corker this issue went way beyond routine politics Deficits matter he forcefully asserted They are a greater threat  us than North Korea or ISISIn the end after 11 years in the Senate I know every bill we consider is imperfect and the question becomes is our country better off with or without this piece of legislation I think we are better off with itAll of this raises a basic question How could nearly every Republican representative  and all 52 Republican senars  support the tax bill The best answer may be the most cynical because it benefits key leaders their friends their heirs and their donorsAfter looking at the legislation in its entirety  its substance and the procedures used  get there  it is difficult  conclude that the motivations of its sponsors are either benevolent or somehow in the best interests of the country More likely it is hypocrisy and venality mixed up in one awful billCollapse,business
Throughout his presidential campaign Donald J Trump exlled his business acumen and management skills and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition  his administration was going very very smoothlyYet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January after publication of the Michael Wolff tellall Fire and Fury the president had  publicly defend himself as a stable geniusAnd that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations or the announcement on Wednesday  the White House communications direcr Hope Hicks  the fourth person  hold the job  that she o was leavingNow at least one White House faction wants Gary Cohn the chief economic adviser and National Economic Council direcr  and a relative island of calm and stability   replace John F Kelly the chief of staff who was widely criticized for bungling the Porter affair If so he would become the presidents third chief of staff in just 14 months But in this chaotic environment for every rumor that Mr Cohn is about  be promoted there is one that he is about  resignWith over a full year under Mr Trumps belt and his unorthodox management style fully in evidence I asked several experts  assess the presidents abilities as a managerIts much worse than I expected said Jeffrey Pfeffer professor of organizational behavior at Stanford University and the author of Power Why Some People Have It and Others DontThe most important thing you need as a chief executive is the ability  hire and retain talent Mr Pfeffer said Trump said hed get all these great people  work for him But the rate of departures is unprecedented Either he hired badly or he hired well but couldnt retain them Either way this reflects badly on his leadershipAs Jeffrey T Polzer professor of human resource management at Harvard Business School ld me last year the timetested approach is  surround yourself with talented people who have the most expertise who bring different perspectives  the issue at handThen you foster debate and invite different points of view in order  reach a highquality solution Mr Polzer saidHe added that it requires an openness  being challenged and some selfawareness and even humility  acknowledge that there are areas where other people know more than you doMr Trump does appear  solicit and consider the opinions of others but they are as likely  be random guests at MaraLago or television pundits as they are experts in the field or even his own appointeesThe lack of attention  data drives me nuts Mr Pfeffer said Mr Trump he said seems  have no interest in science social science or data citing White House initiatives  repeal Obamacare and  rescue the coal industry as glaring examplesOthers pointed  his threats  pull out of the North American Free Trade Agreement with little understanding of the consequences for American businesses and farmers and his decision  abandon the Paris climate accord despite scant familiarity with the science of climate changeNothing about the chaos and turnover in the White House surprises me said Charles M Elson a professor and direcr of the John L Weinberg Center for Corporate vernance at the University of DelawarePlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersHe hasnt changed in 30 years Mr Elson added He isnt bound  any traditional norms of managementYet despite the welldocumented disarray prevailing in the West Wing Mr Trumps first year has yielded some major accomplishments businessfriendly tax legislation the appointment of a reliably conservative Supreme Court justice in Neil rsuch the selection of Jerome Powell as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the dismantling of a regulary regime viewed as overly burdensome  the business communityYou have  hand it  him He has pulled some rabbits out of his hat Mr Elson said Hardly anyone thought he could pull off tax legislation after so many other people had tried and failedBut Mr Pfeffer said those achievements had occurred despite the chaos not because of it For every success Mr Trump has had notable failures starting with overhauling immigration policy and repealing ObamacareIve long felt that if Trump didnt do well it would be because of organizational issues Mr Pfeffer said Even with Republicans in control of both houses of Congress he hasnt been able  pass much That speaks  chaos in the policy sphereMr Elson said Mr Trump acted more like the typical entrepreneur than an experienced manager A problem with entrepreneurs is that people get tired of it and they move on he said People just get worn out At some point you need a real manager A lot of entrepreneurs sell their businesses when they reach a certain size and they realize they cant manage themWould naming Mr Cohn as chief of staff ameliorate the problem Despite disenchantment with Mr Kelly and his handling of the Porter situation no one I interviewed thinks Mr Cohn could fundamentally change the dynamic in the Trump White House any more than Mr Kelly hasMr Cohn is now basking in the afterglow of the tax legislation which seems  be growing in popularity with the public His supporters point  the firstrate team he assembled at the National Economic Council as evidence that he  perhaps alone among p White House officials  could attract and retain talent He enjoys good relations with CongressBut if Mr Cohn became Mr Trumps chief of staff he would have  sublimate his own beliefs  the presidents agenda As one former White House official ld me He cant pull another Charlottesville referring  Mr Cohns efforts last summer  publicly distance himself from the presidents racially charged comments while still working for himThanks  that incident Mr Cohn has already fallen from favor once and his current rehabilitation may not last People like Mr Trump have friends for a day Mr Elson said Thats another quality of the entrepreneur Like it or not its part of what makes them successfulWhile Mr Cohn has influential supporters at the White House talk of his possible elevation has prompted plenty of opposition o especially from representatives of Mr Trumps populist base Mr Cohn is after all a longtime Manhattan DemocratA White House spokesman declined  comment on behalf of Mr CohnIn any event Mr Trump may be oblivious  the staff turnover and widespread vacancies in the executive branch and indifferent  calls  replace Mr KellyI dont think Trump thinks much about management philosophy Mr Pfeffer said He ran for president as a lark and look at him now For him its all upsideSee More,business

News AnalysisWASHINGTON  Lost in the showdown between President Trump and James B Comey that played out this past week was a chilling threat  the United States Mr Comey the former direcr of the FBI testified that the Russians had not only intervened in last years election but would try  do it againWhat started out as a counterintelligence investigation  guard the United States against a hostile foreign power has morphed in a political scandal about what Mr Trump did what he said and what he meant  it Lawmakers have focused mainly on the gripping conflict between the president and the FBI direcr he fired with cascading requests for documents recordings and hearingsBut from the headquarters of the National Security Agency  state capitals that have discovered that the Russians were inside their voterregistration systems the worry is that attention will be diverted from figuring out how Russia disrupted American democracy last year and how  prevent it from happening again Russian hackers did not just breach Democratic email accounts according  Mr Comey they orchestrated a massive effort targeting hundreds of  and possibly more than 1000  American government and private organizations since 2015Its important for us in the West  understand that were facing an adversary who wishes for his own reasons  do us harm said Daniel Fried a career diplomat who oversaw sanctions imposed on Russia before retiring this year Whatever the domestic politics of this Comey was spon right that Russia is coming after us but not just the US but the free world in general And we need  take this seriouslyMr Comeys willingness  discuss the threat in public was something of a change of heart As FBI direcr he supervised counterintelligence investigations in computer breakins that harvested emails from the State Department and the White House and that penetrated deep in the computer systems of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Yet President Barack Obamas administration did not want  publicize those intrusions choosing  handle them diplomatically  perhaps because at the time they looked more like classic espionage than an effort  manipulate American politicsMr Comeys special agents failed  react aggressively  evidence of the breach of the Democratic National Committee spending nine months exchanging phone calls and vague warnings with young informationtechnology specialists at the committee while Russian intelligence agencies cleaned out the organizations emails Only when emails from Hillary Clinns presidential campaign began showing up on WikiLeaks and other sites did the bureau recognize the scope of the operationIn Ocber Mr Comey declined  sign a statement publicly accusing Russia of meddling in the election  not because he doubted the evidence aides later said the issue was already a matter of public discussion and he argued that it would seem o political so close  Election Day Now many members of Mr Obamas national security team say they wish they had raised the alarm about Russia earlierAnd there is no evidence that the Russians have spped The NSA suspects that a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers which has published ols used  the agency  breach foreign computer networks is a front for Russia probably the GRU the military intelligence armThe land Security Department is also looking at new evidence of computer code buried in the electrical power grid Russia is believed  be behind two major attacks on Ukraines grid and there are warnings that those techniques could also be turned on the United StatesThe strategys central concept she said refined in attacks on Eastern European countries is that it is better  collapse a country from withinEric S Edelman who was an under secretary of defense under President George W Bush said Russian information warfare capabilities were highly developed In the Cold War the Soviet efforts in this regard were hamhanded and could be countered with relative ease he said Today the Russians are much more sophisticated and they see things like disinformation propaganda and what we used  call active measures as part of a suite of capabilitiesGraham Allison a longtime Russia scholar at Harvard said Russias cyberintrusion in the recent presidential election signals the beginning of what is almost sure  be an intensified cyberwar in which both they  and we  seek  participate in picking the leaders of an adversary The difference he added is that American elections are generally fair so we are much more vulnerable  such manipulation than is Russia where results are often preordainedIn Washingn however the issue has become partisan because Mr Trump insists that any discussion of Russian meddling in the election is an attack on his legitimacy He has dismissed the Russia inquiry as fake news generated  Democrats  explain their defeatHe repeated that during a news conference on Friday That was an excuse  the Democrats who lost an election that some people think they shouldnt have lost he saidMr Trump has rarely expressed concern about Russias role last year or its continuing efforts in Europe Under questioning at the Senate panel hearing on Thursday Mr Comey said the president never asked him after taking office what the government should be doing  protect against future Russian interventionThere should be no fuzz on this whatsoever Mr Comey said The Russians interfered in our election during the 2016 cycle They did it with purpose They did it with sophistication They did it with overwhelming technical efforts And it was an activemeasures campaign driven from the p of that government There is no fuzz on thatHe added Thats about as unfake as you can possibly get and is very very seriousWhat we didnt talk enough about was the purpose we were there about Russias involvement and Russias intent how doggedly that they tried everything humanly possible and they will continue  keep trying and hitting on us  change how we do business in America how we elect our officials the confidence we have in our government Senar Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia said Friday on Morning Joe on MSNBCSimilar warnings have been issued  others in the intelligence community led  James R Clapper Jr who has sounded the alarm since retiring in January as direcr of national intelligence I dont think people have their head around the scope of what the Russians are doing he said recentlyBut few doubt that the Russians have concluded that their attack on the American system was successful beyond their dreams  they started a scandal that has consumed the American political processThey can win two ways Senar Sheldon Whitehouse a Rhode Island Democrat who has been investigating the election hacking through the Senate Judiciary Committee

NonfictionWhen you purchase an independently reviewed book through our site we earn an affiliate commissionIn recent decades American public discourse has become hollow and shrill Instead of morally robust debates about the common good we have shouting matches on talk radio and cable television and partisan food fights in Congress People argue past one another without really listening or seeking  persuadeThis condition has diminished the publics regard for political parties and politicians and also given rise  a danger A politics empty of moral argument creates a vacuum of meaning that is often filled  the vengeful certitudes of strident nationalism This danger now hovers over American politics More than a year in the presidency of Donald Trump however liberals and progressives have yet  articulate a politics of the common good adequate  the countrys predicamentReichs book diagnoses the decline of the common good in American life and suggests ways of resring it He begins  observing that even the term has fallen in disuse The common good is no longer a fashionable idea The phrase is rarely uttered day not even  commencement speakers and politiciansReich defines the common good as consisting in our shared values about what we owe one another as citizens who are bound gether in the same society What binds us as Americans he argues is not birth or ethnicity but a commitment  fundamental ideals and principles respect for the rule of law and democratic institutions leration of our differences and belief in equal political rights and equal opportunityReich attributes the erosion of the common good in recent decades  the breakdown of moral restraint in the pursuit of power and money In Washingn the whateverittakeswin politics that began in the Nixon years has led  the hyperpartisanship of day In the corporate world the singleminded pursuit of shareholder value has displaced the older notion that companies are responsible for the wellbeing of workers cusmers and the communities they serveThe unbridled pursuit of power and profit has brought an enormous flow of corporate money in politics The result is a rigged system that perpetuates inequality enables economic elites  manipulate the rules of the game  their own advantage undermines trust in institutions and promotes attitudes of unrestrained selfseeking in social life generallyThere are several ways  revive the common good Reich suggests One is  recover the notion of leadership as trusteeship Corporate executives should recognize responsibilities beyond maximizing profits and public officials should resist the scorchedearth anythinggoes approach  politics The essence of Trumps failure as a leader according  Reich is not that he has chosen one set of policies over another or has divided rather than united Americans or even that he has behaved in childish and vindictive ways unbecoming a president It is that he has sacrificed the processes and institutions of American democracy  achieve his goalsReich also calls for a greater emphasis on civic education including two years of mandary public service and efforts  resurrect truth from the miasma of political deceit and fake news Perhaps the most distinctive measure Reich proposes is the redeployment of honor and shame Rather than honor people for their wealth or celebrity we should honor those who display genuine virtue like whistleblowers firefighters social workers and soldiers  people who perform hard or risky tasks that serve the common good And we should shame those who however wealthy achieve their status through exploitative business practices or morally dubious financial dealingsAgainst the grain of much liberal thinking Reich acknowledges that promoting civic virtue requires being judgmental about what moral attitudes and qualities of character our public life should affirm and promote This recognition of the role of moral judgment in politics is an important corrective  the liberal wariness of bringing morality in the public squareReichs proposals would make a good starting point for a new progressive political project What is puzzling however is his insistence that a politics of the common good can or should be nonpartisan Time and again he draws a sharp distinction between the common good he wants  revive and the competing conceptions of the common good at stake in everyday political debate  about tax policy health care the environment and so on He insists his book is not about what messages Democrats or Republicans should convey or what policies they should pursue but rather about resring our shared commitment  democratic norms and principles Its our agreement  these principles that connects us not agreement about where these principles leadAs these examples suggest the nonpartisan abovethefray conception of the common good that Reich proposes may be o highminded  reinvigorate American public discourse in the way he wants In the face of President Trumps serial violations of democratic norms it is tempting  appeal  Americans whatever their party or political persuasion  reaffirm certain principles that all can share But such principles if truly detached from debate about where they lead are so abstract that they can only serve as hortary fare for commencement addresses and the Fourth of July The best hope for reviving the common good is  invigorate moral argument in the messy contentious domain of democratic politicsMichael J Sandel teaches political philosophy at Harvard and is the author most recently of What Money

On the fringes of the immigration debate you have Donald Trump and his small band of nativists peddling fears and falsehoods For those of us who inhabit a factdriven reality you have a growing body of credible research demonstrating the benefits of immigrants and the burdens of following Trumps radical proposalsImmigration is primarily a redistributive policy transferring income from workers  owners of capital and from taxpayers  lowincome immigrant familiesThese opposing views demonstrate the complexity of the core findings in the academys report which is multifaceted enough  allow for competing interpretations The report suggests that immigration is not a clearcut issue in which one side is right and the other wrong but that there are both costs and benefitsThe crux of the problem is that the plusses and minuses are not distributed equally The academy found for example that the willingness of lessskilled immigrants  work at low pay reduced consumption costs  the costs  consumers of goods and services like health care child care food preparation house cleaning repair and construction  for millions of Americans This resulted in positive net benefits  the US economy during the last two decades of the 20th century These lowwage workers simultaneously generated a redistribution of wealth from low  highskilled nativeborn workersThe frequent harshness of these tradeoffs in real life is masked  the academic language of the report which points out that nativeborn workers who are substitutes for immigrants will experience negative wage effects  in other words lower wagesThe report continuesIn summary the immigration surplus stems from the increase in the return  capital that results from the increased supply of labor and the subsequent fall in wages Natives who own more capital will receive more income from the immigration surplus than natives who own less capital who can consequently be adversely affectedImmigration is integral  the nations economic growth The inflow of labor supply has helped the United States avoid the problems facing other economies that have stagnated as a result of unfavorable demographics particularly the effects of an aging work force and reduced consumption  older residents In addition the infusion of human capital  highskilled immigrants has boosted the nations capacity for innovation entrepreneurship and technological changeThe academys report provides ammunition  both sides in the contentious debate over whether immigrants raise state and local tax burdens for education health care and other welfare benefits or whether those costs are more than compensated for through taxes paid  immigrantsFor the 20112013 period the net cost  state and local budgets of first generation adults is on average about 1600 each In contrast second and thirdplus generation adults create a net positive of about 1700 and 1300 each respectively  state and local budgets These estimates imply that the tal annual fiscal impact of first generation adults and their dependents averaged across 201113 is a cost of 574 billion while second and thirdplus generation adults create a benefit of 305 billion and 2238 billion respectivelyimmigrants do not pay enough in taxes  cover their consumption of public services at the present timeIf we claim we are for family then we have  pull gether and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because its the right thing  do  and it is  but because they know it strengthens families strengthens our economy and strengthens our countryWhen politicians talk about immigration reform they mean amnesty cheap labor and open borders The SchumerRubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway  the corporate patrons who run both parties Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first  not wealthy globetrotting donors We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our ownThe two trends have roughly tracked one another since the 1880s1880s90s1920s30s1960s70s20001314121086Percent ofpopulation

families in their native countriesThe academys report disputes that claim citing studies showing that very small adverse economic consequences result from remittances and numerous benefits includinghaving a substantial and important role in moving funds from rich  poor countries which is needed  speed up global growth and reduce crosscountry inequality and possibly also international migrationImmigration fuels the economy When immigrants enter the labor force they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDP In addition she continued immigrants grease the wheels of the labor market  flowing in industries and areas where there is a relative need for workers  where bottlenecks or shortages might otherwise damp growth When immigrants enter the labor force they increase the productive capacity of the economy and raise GDPBut Orrenius acknowledges there are downsides Immigrationlowers the wages of competing workers while raising the return  capital and the wages of complementary workers In other words the immigration surplus does not accrue equally  everyone It goes primarily  the owners of capital which includes business and landowners and invesrsOrrenius points out where the disadvantages of immigration primarily accrueCompeting workers wages fall at least in the initial transition period as the economy adjusts  the new labor inflow Research suggests that previous immigrants suffer more of the adverse wage effects than do natives Research also suggests any negative wage effects are concentrated among lowskilled  not highskilled  workersThis conclusion which is supported  many of the empirical studies included in the report goes  the heart of a Democratic dilemma which the party rarely addresses publiclyAmong Democrats of all ethnicities and races support for immigration and immigrants has risen steadilyPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking the boxInvalid email address Please reenterYou must select a newsletter  subscribe View all New York Times newslettersThe economic winners from rising immigration levels are closely associated with the establishment wing of the Republican Party businesses and landowners and invesrs as Orrenius noted It is just this wing that Trump ran against during the primariesThe National Academy notes the tension between winners and losers throughout the reportThe arrival of immigrants raises the overall income of the native population that absorbs them the immigration surplus This surplus is directly related  the degree  which immigration changes wages and returns  capital In the simplest models the more wages decline the larger the surplusThere is however no agreement on the scope or size of the lost wages resulting from immigrationJennifer Hunt a professor of economics at Rutgers and a member of the academy panel wrote in an email that what we did not come  a consensus about was a number for the wage decrease experienced  native high school dropoutsNot only was there no consensus on the academy panel on the size of the wage loss among nativeborn high school graduates among immigration scholars there is a sharp debate over whether there is any loss at allEconomic theory implies that immigration should lower the wage of competing workers and increase the wage of complementary workers For example an influx of foreignborn laborers reduces the economic opportunities for laborers  all laborers now face stiffer competition in the labor market At the same time highskill natives may gain substantially They pay less for the services that laborers provide such as painting the house and mowing the lawn and natives who hire these laborers can now specialize in producing the goods and services that better suit their skillsBorjas separately concluded that all highschool dropouts experience a substantial wage loss from immigration of 63 percent in the short run and 31 percent over the long haul as labor markets adjust  the increased number of workersKatz said in an email exchange that his more recent work with Claudia ldin also a Harvard economist has convinced him that immigration is at most a small contribur  the awful real and relative wage performance of US high school dropouts whose relative wages fell  40 percent compared  college graduates from 1980  the early 2000sKatzs botm lineThe effects of immigration range from 0  a few percentage points and are swamped  the impacts of slowdown in US education supplies technological change and eroding labor market institutions unions minimum wages rising outsourcingfissuring of the workplaceIn an email exchange Card wrote that his own research suggests that the effect of immigration on nativeborn workers without high school degrees is zeroWhile the most common assumption is that a larger work force drives down wages in practice when you look at the evidence larger population normally increases productivity Card wroteIf the antiimmigration forces gain ground in this election such vicries will prove shortlived For one thing the rise in global trade and financial transactions has been steady over the past 35 yearsFor the past several centuries the world has experienced a sequence of intellectual revolutions against oppression of one sort or another These revolutions operate in the minds of humans and are spread  eventually  most of the world  not  war which tends  involve multiple causes but  language and communications technology Ultimately the ideas they advance  unlike the causes of war  become noncontroversialAs technology reduces the cost of transportation and communications  near the vanishing point achieving this equalization is increasingly feasible But getting there requires removing old barriers and preventing the erection of new ones Shiller writes concluding thatUltimately the next revolution will likely stem from daily interactions on computer monirs with foreigners whom we can see are intelligent decent people  people who happen through no choice of their own  be living in povertyBefore we get there though this years candidates have made irreconcilable proposals on immigrationI want good people  come here from all over the world but I want them  do so legally We can expedite the process we can reward achievement and excellence but we have  respect the legal process And those people who take advantage of the system and come here illegally should never enjoy the benefits of being a resident  or citizen  of this nation So I am against any path  citizenship for undocumented

people that she won over a white Miami police officer  demonstrating her riding skills She ld people that she was followed through back roads  an angry white mob yet she outran them and then found a kind white gas station owner who allowed her  fill up her tank free There was also folklore passed from one generation of relatives  the next that Stringfield had worked for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and perhaps she had disappeared  protect themThe sries were outrageous enough  ring true Only Stringfield knew if they really wereFerrar had passed on some of the misinformation of Stringfields early life wanting  keep her legacy alive Asked recently about these untruths Ferrar wrote in an email Bessies running from her early past does not discount or in any way lessen her unusual achievements as an adult and that is why Bessie continues  inspire new generations and rightfully soShe asked me  tell her truth as her friend Ferrar said in an interviewHer lasting power was in her presence especially in the eyes of children during a period when seeing a black woman commanding a HarleyDavidson was unprecedentedBennett and her brothers remembered how their aunt would whirl in and out of Baltimore where they lived Their mother was Mary Louise White Skinner one of Stringfields older sisters They described their aunt as worldly and wilyI was knee high  a duck She would never tell nobody what her business was said Robert Irving Skinner 74 a nephewDavid Skinner 76 another nephew said their mother would yell at Stringfield Get those boys off that bikeShe would stand up on that bike with one foot on the seat and one foot on the handlebars he said laughing in a phone interviewBennett was once so rattled  a ride with Stringfield that she refused  get back on She jumped the track I ok a car back She gave me car fareMorcycle riding was unladylike  societal norms in the early 20th century and the family elders did not approve said Jackie Reid 70 the daughter of one of Stringfields half sisters who added that they were also worried about her safetyThere was an argument in the 1950s that the children were not privy  and Stringfield did not visit againThe last they heard from her was she was in Florida Reid said She was a wandererMarriage records show Stringfield spent some time in Indiana And 1945 census records show that she claimed Massachusetts as her birthplace but she also said she had been born around 1918In the 1950s she finally settled down in Miami first working as a domestic and later becoming a certified nursing assistantShe befriended the families that employed her making an outsized impression on Robert Scott Thomas and Tom Thomas who were in elementary school in the early 1950sTheir mother delayed or forgetful failed  pick them up from school one day so Stringfield came  the rescue We found Bessie out there on her Harley and in her leather jacket said Tom Thomas 70Both jumped on the morcycle with her I was just a little kid so I was only wrapped around half of her Robert Scott Thomas said I could feel the heat from the exhaust on my legAll the kids were going crazy he saidBea Hines a columnist at The Miami Herald wrote a profile of Stringfield in 1981 She made for a colorful interview sharing her feats and her preference for men many years her junior She claimed  have married six of themHines also had a personal

At the same time thats not a complete pictureA 2013 study of red and blue America conducted well before the seismic events of the last two years sheds additional light on the Republican elecrate and provides a more complicated understanding of contemporary conservatismThe most conservative and most Republican of the three psychological regions  which Rentfrow labels Cluster 1 Friendly and Conventional  extends across the northern tier of the United States from Montana  Michigan down through the Midwest  almost all of the South for a tal of 26 states The accompanying map shows the region in shades of purpleRentfrow found that the Cluster 1 region isless affluent has fewer highly educated residents and is less innovative compared with states in the other regions States in this region also appeared  have higher levels of social capital and less social lerance compared with states in other regions Moreover friendly and conventional states were more politically conservative and Protestant compared with other regionsRentfrow and his coauthors write that the regionis defined  moderately high levels of extroversion agreeableness and conscientiousness moderately low neuroticism and very low opennessand thatthis configuration of traits portrays the sort of person who is sociable considerate dutiful and traditionalI asked a number of experts in political psychology what they thought about the Rentfrow paper and their answers ran the gamut from those who support a more empathetic portrayal of Republican voters  those who are adamant in their view that authoritarianism remains a dominant characteristic of those on the rightI started with Rentfrow himself My question went as followsSome research shows that Republicans and Trump voters in particular score high on measures of authoritarianism and on critical if not hostile views of AfricanAmericans and immigrants How does this fit with your finding that residents of the most Republican region are friendly sociable and considerateRentfrow replied thatindividuals high in authoritarianism score low in openness So in this sense the patterns of results we find at the regional level are consistentMany whites in the South he argued abide  an honor culture As longas everyone is respectful and abides  the social norms everyone is happy and agreeable But when threats are made against ones reputation or values acts of violence and physical aggression are considered appropriate forms of retribution In some ways the profile we observe uches on the surface of this profile  the friendly and considerate aspect when all is well But I think were now beginning  see more of the aggressive aspects I think many people perhaps especially in this region have begun  feel threatened  the changes taking place in society and are reacting with angerStenner explained this seeming contradiction  noting thatit is a lot easier  be generous and considerate and civicminded and invested in ones community if ones community is full of people much like oneself The kinds of behaviors we get out of authoritarians depend critically on how and where they have drawn the boundaries of us and them They can be very attentive  us but also tend  be very particular about whom us includesJohn Jost a professor of psychology and politics at NYU expands upon the implications of the word conscientiousness in describing red state votersConscientiousness is correlated with measures of racism sexism homophobia prejudice authoritarianism social dominance and system justification I suspect that this personality facr has more  do with a need for order or desire for rulefollowing which can easily take an authoritarian turn than other aspects of conscientiousness that we might associate with say honesty or integrityIn the opposite corner from Jost Marc Hetheringn a political scientist at Vanderbilt and a coauthor of the 2009 book Authoritarianism and Polarization in American Politics said he has abandoned use of the word authoritarian because he views it as excessively pejorative In place of authoritarian Hetheringn said he will now use the phrase fixed worldviewThe adherence  established traditions what scholars derisively call conventionalism is very much a characteristic of high conscientiousness Hetheringn wroteWhether you think this is good or bad probably depends on what you think of community norms In my view there is a lot of good  many of them Fixed worldview people want  protect themHetheringn added a cautionary noteHere is the problem though If you are perceived as outside that community the enforcement of those norms isnt going  feel very goodJonathan Haidt a social psychologist at NYUs Stern School of Business raised a crucial if obvious point Primary season Trump voters do not represent all Republican votersWe cant really know just on the basis of this paper whether these traits apply  Trump voters All we can know is that these traits are more common in states and regions that voted for Trump It is possible that the people who most show the positively valenced personality traits did not have Trump as their first choice in the primary but then once the general election came around most of them voted for the Republican candidate which is what partisans do in our two party system with very little party switchingMatt Motyl a political psychologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago argued in an email that in the general election thetypical Trump voter is not a raging screaming white nationalist the typical Trump voter is not much different from the typical Romney McCain or Bush voter They are just ordinary RepublicansThere is however a subset of Trump supporters who are extraordinarily vocal in their inlerance and white nationalism according  Motyl These activists have become the template of the stereotype of Trump voters he wrote As is the case for many stereotypes he added there is a grain of truth but the grain of truth is just that  a grainIn fact authoritarian voters with a sense of besieged white identity are more than a grain in the Republican elecrateAnd the clout of the authoritarian white identity wing of the Republican Party is such that Trump is governing  please this wing first and foremostFrom his apocalyptic threats  Kim Jongun  his call for the firing of protesting NFL players from his pardon of Joe Arpaio  his defense of proNazi protesters in Charlottesville Trump has remained the leader of hardright white AmericaThis strategy won him the presidency in 2016 when millions of nonauthoritarian white Republicans  sympathetic kind affectionate conscientiousness persevering thorough and reliable  made a pact with the devil and chose party loyalty over conscience Whos  say it

YouTube and ogleInstagram and FacebookTumblr and YahooLinkedIn and MicrosoftIn the relentless push ward consolidation in technology and social media Twitter the social networking site that allows users  send and receive short messages or tweets has been the perennial bridesmaid But this weeks megadeal between Microsoft and LinkedIn has renewed speculation on Wall Street that Twitter needs  attract a suir or risk being overtaken  everlarger competirsIf current trends continue its inevitable that Twitter will get acquired Robert Peck managing direcr and internet equity analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ld me this week Mr Peck has long considered a Twitter deal likely and he renewed that prediction last week even before the MicrosoftLinkedIn deal was announced This week numerous analysts piled on  the notionInvesrs seem  agree At one point this week Twitter shares were up 17 percent on deal speculation pushing the companys market capitalization  nearly 115 billionBut invesrs expecting a big deal at a LinkedIn premium in the next few months may want  think twiceGiven the similarities between LinkedIn and Twitter its not hard  see why shareholders would be betting on a sudden windfall Until Mondays announcement both companies scks were trading at relative bargain prices both down about 42 percent in the last six months Before this weeks rally Twitter shares were barely half their 26 initial public offering priceBoth offer global reach and a large number of users 433 million registered members worldwide for LinkedIn and 310 million active monthly users for Twitter the numbers arent directly comparable because not all LinkedIn members are active usersApart from Facebook and several Chinese social networking companies Twitter has the largest user base among independent social network companies according  Statista Statista estimates LinkedIns active monthly users at 100 millionTwitter solidified its place as a hub of the global news conversation during and after last weekends massacre at a gay nightclub in OrlandoThat kind of reach is extremely difficult  replicate in an increasingly crowded digital world We continue  believe that Twitter remains a platform with massive opportunity said Ken Sena managing direcr and consumer internet analyst at EvercoreMark Mahaney technology analyst at RBC Capital Markets agreed Theyve got a great brand a large platform and a unique value propositionA megadeal with a much bigger partner would give Twitter scale which is becoming allimportant in a Silicon Valley now dominated  a handful of tech giantsAs the LinkedIn chief executive Jeff Weiner put it in his memo  employees explaining the deal Imagine a world where were no longer looking up at tech titans such as Apple ogle Microsoft Amazon and Facebook and wondering what it would be like  operate at their extraordinary scale  because were one of them Imagine a world where were not reacting  the intensifying competitive landscape  were leading it with advantages most companies can only dream of leveragingFor Jack Dorsey one of Twitters founders and its chief executive the right deal wouldnt even mean giving up his leadership role or independence Following the lead of Alphabet and Facebook which have given considerable aunomy  the large operations theyve acquired Microsoft promised Mr Weiner that he could run LinkedIn as a fully independent entityThe Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella had me at independence Mr Weiner wrote in his memoBut if the reasons for a Twitter deal seem so obvious and compelling why hasnt it happened yet The fact is that Twitter faces some unique challenges and just because its a big social media site and prominent Silicon Valley denizen doesnt mean its going  attract a suir Yahoo has been openly shopping itself for months and wouldbe buyers havent exactly been beating down its doorFor at least some of the allimportant  advertisers millennial users that may well be the case Jacob Shiansky 24 who was visiting Manhattan from South Carolina ld me this week that he couldnt remember his Twitter password and hasnt visited the site in six monthsIts o much business and political promotions rather than a social media site he said If you want  see Trumps ridiculous tweets you can go on Facebook or CNN You dont have  bother with TwitterPlease verify youre not a robot  clicking

said Theyre quick and theyre fun You dont have  waste your time typingI cant say my own Twitter use has been all that prolific even though I sometimes use it  comment on my column and  recommend sries  other journalists But Ive spped following some people who spew what seems a constant stream of drivel Days go  when I dont look at the siteUser engagement has become an increasingly important metric for advertisers because it enhances ad exposure and gives the site more information about its users enabling it  target ads betterWe regularly survey advertisers and ask them  rank internet platforms Mr Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets said ogle ranks first Facebook second and Twitter is somewhere down the list Thats been true for every survey he saidTwitter is increasingly seen as a source of news and information more than user interaction That makes it a natural fit for a news organization seeking  extend its digital footprint and rumors that News Corporation was interested briefly buoyed the sck this year News Corporation denied the reports and no bid materializedFew traditional media companies though are big enough  swallow Twitter at its current market value News Corporation one of the richest has a market capitalization of just under 7 billionMr Peck and Mr Mahaney cited Alphabet as the most likely buyer The two companies already have many ties Several Twitter executives used  work at Alphabets ogle tweets appear in ogle search results and advertisers can buy ads on Twitter through ogles DoubleClick bid managerogles own social networking effort ogle Plus hasnt caught on ogle undoubtedly has the size and scale  absorb TwitterBut Alphabets founders have said repeatedly they dont want  create content So if Twitter is increasingly seen as a realtime news and content site rather than a social media network it doesnt fit in ogles strategic objectives Those of course could always changeBoth ogle and Facebook have reportedly looked at Twitter and passed Neither company would comment on those reports Jim Prosser a Twitter spokesman also declined  comment for this columnBut Facebook has in many ways emerged as Twitters biggest competir A deal would raise antitrust issues and its not clear why Facebook would pay a premium for something it could largely build on its ownFrom a strategic standpoint the cable media giants Verizon Communications and Comcast might make sense Both are big enough both are already content providers and both have shown interest in expanding their digital presence But its not clear either company has the expertise  solve Twitters major problems which are far afield from the cable network businessA lot of this weeks deal talk seems more like wishful thinking among Twitter invesrs desperate for a LinkedInstyle exit strategy That may be slow in coming Even Mr Peck of SunTrust doesnt expect a deal before 2017 at the earliest because its still early in Mr Dorseys latest turnaround effortOthers are even more skeptical I can see the argument for it but Im not betting on a deal Mr Mahaney said There just arent many logical buyersSee More,business

Common SenseIts official Returns for college and university endowments for the 2017 fiscal year are in and while they averaged a respectable 122 percent for the year over the last decade they have underperformed funds offering a simple 6040 or 7030 sckfixed income allocationWith their average returns dragged down  the weak performance of hedge funds venture capital and private equity you would think endowments would be fleeing these socalled alternative investments which are costly and mostly illiquid as some large pension funds have doneOn the contrary endowments are holding firm or even adding  these holdings Last year alternative investments accounted for an average of 52 percent of endowment assets  over 60 percent in the largest endowments  the same percentage as two years ago according  the annual NacuboCommonfund study of endowmentsYet over the last 10 years the average endowment earned a 46 percent annualized return lower than the 53 percent return for a lowcost 6040 sckbond index fund portfolio and 54 percent for a 7030 mixFor endowments greater than 1 billion the average return was 5 percent Had they realized that extra threetenths of a percent or 30 basis points that the 6040 portfolio delivered theyd have on average an additional 47 million in their endowmentsThe trend is likely  be even more pronounced next year when the financial crisis results of the 2009 fiscal year drop out of the 10year calculations Thats because alternatives did provide something of a buffer during that severe bear market but have mostly underperformed sinceFiveyear averages suggest the magnitude of the gap The average endowment had annualized fiveyear returns of 59 percent A 6040 mix returned 82 percent and a 7030 mix returned 92Thats tens of millions of dollars that could have otherwise funded scholarships built a new museum wing or bolster the corpus of the endowment  help future generations said Chrispher Philips head of Vanguard Institutional Advisory Services Hes not a disinterested observer Vanguard is a major purveyor of  and advocate for  lowcost index and mutual fundsIts frustrating because these institutions do so much good work and most of them could be doing so much better Mr Philips saidEven Yale University which pioneered the socalled Yale Model now slavishly followed  many other endowments and has a target allocation of nearly 90 percent of its assets in alternative assets has seen its outperformance shrink in recent years Yale delivered an 113 percent return for 2017 but that was below the average return for all endowments of 122 percent according  the study  Nacubo the National Association of College and University Business OfficersYale still boasts a stellar 20year annualized return of 121 percent far above the endowment 20year average of 74 percent according  the university But its 10year annualized return has slipped  just 66 percent That still puts it in the p 5 percent of all endowment returns Still Yale ld me that its chief investment officer David Swensen is bullish on the schools portfolio relative  scks and bonds for the next 10 yearsThe endowments persistent devotion  highcost alternative assets in the face of such poor performance now documented across a decadelong span baffles many We keep scratching our heads Mr Philips of Vanguard saidAmong the schools we survey theres a strong belief in the endowment model pioneered 30 years or so ago  Yale and a few other schools said Kenneth E Redd senior direcr of research and policy analysis for Nacubo Were not seeing any changes in portfolio alignment or investment philosophy even though the indexes have clearly outperformed both managed funds and hedge funds Theres still this belief that alternatives will provide some measure of outperformanceHe noted that endowments of more than 1 billion which tend  have high allocations  alternatives did on average outperform the 6040 mix but not the 7030 mix over the most recent fiveyear periodJeff Schwartz Markovs president agreed Were talking about true believers in the value of alternatives he said Many endowment managers he added arent completely objectiveTheyve seen it work in the past sometimes in a spectacular way he continued Its hard  take an embedded belief system like that and say just because weve had an outstanding bull market that you should move  6040 Thats a tall orderGiven the need  cover increased costs not  mention the recent tax legislation that seeks  tax the wealthiest endowments asset managers at colleges are under increasing pressure  generate higher returns even as lofty sck valuations and rising interest rates suggest it will be hard  get 75 percent with a traditional asset mix going forward Mr Philips saidSo theres a strong inclination  turn  something that promises higher returns he said even if they havent delivered in the recent pastHe also pointed  the massive marketing machine in the alternative space which is causing investment managers  turn a blind eye  whats really happening in financial marketsUniversities depend heavily on draws from their endowments  typically 5 percent or more per year   meet spending needs and are still haunted  memories of the financial crisis This months sck market volatility was a painful reminderSo the promise of alternative investments  mitigate risk and protect against market downturns has been powerful even if they havent deliveredBut with longterm  even infinite  time horizons university endowments should be able  withstand market volatilityWere aware of the need  support current spending Mr Philips said but if growing the corpus  support future spending is a primary objective there should be more traditional equity exposure not less Adding nontraditional assets would be OK if they were compensating for illiquidity and higher risk but theyre notCollapse,business
PARISBRUSSELS   European powers still want  hand Donald Trump next week a plan  save the Iran nuclear deal but they have also started work on protecting EUIranian business ties if the US president

the US State Department their American interlocursSeveral of the sources said they were skeptical the effort would succeed and all said the Europeans were also working on damage limitation scenarios if it failsWe have a week  continue talking  the Americans  see if we can find an agreement on the deal said a senior European diplomat But I dont think there is any reason  be overly optimisticThe political agreement which is a culmination of transatlantic diplomacy does not include Iran or Russia and China the other parties  the accordIt seeks  spell out  Trump that Europe will seek  contain Tehrans ballistic missile program its influence in Syria and Yemen the terms  which inspecrs visit suspect Iranian sites and sunset clauses under which some of its terms expireWhile the Europeans and the Americans have narrowed their differences they are struggling  agree on how  handle a US desire  extend some of the limits on Irans nuclear program without reopening the July 2015 accordWere trying  find the right formulas that respond  the expectations of the Americans but at the same time do not go against the deal said a second senior European diplomatThere is a chance of getting an agreement but even if we have we one Im not convinced that it will be enough  sp the US withdrawing the diplomat saidIn their package for Trump the Europeans are also grappling with a US desire  make explicit that Iran must give international inspecrs access  military sites The Europeans say this is already implicit in the original dealTheres a US view that the inspection provisions arent strong enough which is not a view that is shared  the Europeans said a third diplomat involved in the discussionsBUYING TIME CONTINGENCY MEASURESFrances President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela

it was waiting for a formal US decision on the Iran deal before deciding whether  sp offering German firms export guarantees for business deals with Tehran Such guarantees provide state protection for

News AnalysisWASHINGTON  Upset about the investigation in Russian interference in last years election President Trump sought relief from James B Comey then the FBI direcr By Mr Comeys account Mr Trump asked him  help lift the cloudBut thanks  Mr Trumps own actions the cloud darkened considerably on Thursday and now seems likely  hover over his presidency for months if not years  comeRather than relieve the pressure Mr Trumps decision  fire Mr Comey has generated an even bigger political and legal threat In his anger at Mr Comey for refusing  publicly disclose that the president was not personally under investigation legal experts said Mr Trump may have actually made himself the target of an investigationBut Mr Comey also revealed that he had turned over memos of his conversations with Mr Trump  that newly appointed special counsel Robert S Mueller III suggesting that investigars may now be looking in whether Mr Trump obstructed justice  dismissing the FBI direcrThis was a devastating day for the Trump White House and when the hisry of the Trump presidency is written this will be seen as a key moment said Peter H Wehner who was White House adviser  President George W Bush My takeaway is James Comey laid out facts and was essentially encouraging Mueller  investigate Trump for obstruction Thats a huge dealThe White House was left in the awkward position of trying  minimize the damage Mr Trump himself remained uncharacteristically silent while his advisers kept the daily briefing off camera and sent out the backup  Sean Spicer the press secretary I can definitively say the president is not a liar Sarah Huckabee Sanders the principal deputy press secretary ld reportersWashingn has not seen a spectacle quite like this since the days of Watergate Irancontra or President Bill Clinns impeachment Whatever the controversies under Mr Bush and President Barack Obama neither was ever accused of personal misconduct  a current or former law enforcement official in such a public forumIndeed Mr Comey highlighted the difference  noting that he had never taken notes of his conversations with either of those presidents because he trusted their basic integrity but he did write memos about each of his oneonone encounters with Mr Trump because I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meetingIn any other presidency the events laid out  Mr Comey  Mr Trump asking for loyalty from the FBI direcr who was investigating the presidents associates then asking him  drop an investigation in a former aide and ultimately firing him when he did not  might have spelled the endBut Mr Trump has tested the boundaries of normal politics and upended the usual rules To his supporters the inquiries are nothing more than the elite news media and political establishment attacking a change agent who threatens their interestsThis is like an explosive presidencyending moment said John Q Barrett a law professor at St Johns University in New York and an associate independent counsel during the Irancontra investigation in Ronald Reagans presidency But we have a different context nowThe articles of impeachment drafted against President Richard M Nixon and Mr Clinn both alleged obstruction of justice in effect making clear that such an action could qualify under the high crimes and misdemeanors clause of the Constitution The smoking gun tape that doomed Mr Nixon in 1974 recorded him ordering his chief of staff  have the CIA block the FBI from investigating the Watergate burglary Critics said that Mr Trumps comments  Mr Comey effectively cut out the middle manThe House impeached Mr Clinn in 1998 for lying under oath and obstructing justice  cover up his affair with Monica Lewinsky a former White House intern during a sexual harassment lawsuit The obstruction alleged in Mr Clinns case was persuading Ms Lewinsky  give false testimony advising her  hide gifts he had given her  avoid any subpoena and trying  find her a job  keep her happy After a trial the Senate acquitted himAs a political matter both Mr Nixon and Mr Clinn faced a House under control of the opposition party while Mr Trump has the benefit of a Republican House that would be far less eager  open an impeachment inquiry And for all of the fireworks on Thursday the reaction in Congress still broke down largely along partisan lines with Democrats in attack mode and Republicans either defending Mr Trump or remaining silent That may leave the question  Mr MuellerThe polarization seems even worse than during the Lewinsky investigation which I hadnt thought possible said Stephen Bates an associate independent counsel during the investigation in Mr Clinn Everyone gets judged in terms of helping or hurting Trump Whatever Mueller does half of the country will call him courageous and half will call him contemptible We just dont know which half is whichHe also assailed Mr Comey for leaking details of his conversations with the president  prompt the appointment of a special counsel although they were not classified It is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue  be those in government who are actively attempting  undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications he said Mr Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakersTellingly the Republicans on the Senate Intelligence Committee paid no heed  the talking points distributed in advance  the Republican National Committee at the behest of the White House Instead of attacking Mr Comeys credibility as the RNC and Donald Trump Jr did the Republican senars praised him as a patriot and dedicated public servant They largely accepted his version of events while trying  elicit testimony that would cast Mr Trumps actions in the most innocent light possibleMr Comey cooperated  some extent  trying not  go o far beyond the facts as he presented them declining for instance  say whether he thought Mr Trumps statements amounted  obstruction of justiceIn a credibility battle between Trump and Comey everybody knows Comey is going  win that war said Adam W ldberg who was an associate special White House counsel under Mr Clinn during Kenneth W Starrs investigationFor Mr Trump the battle with Mr Comey now overshadows much of what he wants  do Major legislation is stalled Mr Kasowitz said the president was eager  continue moving forward with his agenda with the business of this country and with the public cloud removedFor now though the cloud remainsFollow Peter Baker on Twitter peterbakernytCollapse,business
Common SenseSince The Washingn Posts Watergateera glory days my need  read that paper has waxed and waned I already pay for and scour The New York Times of course The Wall Street Journal and The New Yorker which is a lot  manage before I even get  the books on my night stand and Kindle So I havent been looking for more  read let alone another monthly expenseBut for some time a Washingn Post logo with the caption Breaking News has been popping on my lapps screen Im not sure how The Post insinuated itself in my prime digital real estate since I dont recall inviting it there And Id probably find it annoying and intrusive if the breaking news werent so interestingThats when I learned Id bumped up against The Posts pay barrier along with the flattering observation that You obviously love great journalism And for just 99 cents for the first four weeks and a few more clicks I could keep reading Who could resistI became a subscriber for the first time and The Post had just monetized its scoopThe published numbers speculating about our subscription and ad revenue have so underestimated the reality that its comical The Posts chief revenue officer Jed Hartman ld me this week Our digital ad revenue is in the solid nine figures that is in excess of 100 million This year he added well have our third straight year of doubledigit revenue growthCraig Huber a veteran media and newspaper analyst and founder of Huber Research Partners said that while he had not seen The Posts data the gains reported are striking Im very very surprised  those numbers he said No one else is even coming close If thats correct Im very impressedTo be sure as with other newspapers The Posts economic picture is still encumbered  print where declines in circulation and advertising revenue continue unabated And its digital rebound has most likely come from a modest baseScoops  and highquality journalism more generally  are integral  The Posts business model at a time when the future of digital journalism seemed  be veering ward the lowest common denominar of exploding watermelons and stupid pet tricksInvestigative reporting is absolutely critical  our business model Mr Baron ld me We add value We tell people what they didnt already know We hold government and powerful people and institutions accountable This cannot happen without financial support Were at the point where the public realizes that and is willing  step up and support that work  buying subscriptionsHe said digital subscriptions had soared this week in the wake of the latest Russia revelations as they have with other scoops In the first quarter of this year The Post says it added hundreds of thousands of new digital subscribers It would not disclose the overall number of subscribersInvestigative journalism also drives advertising Mr Hartman said Its what elevates our brand he said And other brands want  attach themselves  a trusted brandMr Huber the analyst concurred The only future for newspapers is at the high end of quality journalism he said That and only that are what people are willing  pay forHe said The Post was one of three newspapers along with The Times and The Wall Street Journal that are successfully transforming themselves Theyre showing that a digital strategy is viable he said But the number of people willing  pay 10  12 a month for an online subscription outside those three is a rounding error After the introducry rate The Posts digitalonly access for national subscribers is 999 for four weeksMr Huber noted that given the winnertakeall nature of the internet the sources of scoops are gravitating ward just a few news outlets led  The Times and The Post Sources and people who want  leak go  a publication with the most impact opinion makers and influencers seek the publication with the most sources and scoops  hence the network effect so coveted in technology circles and one well undersod  Mr BezosWhen I asked Mr Baron  name one thing that has driven the turnaround his immediate answer was Mr Bezos  and not because of his vast fortuneThe most fundamental thing Jeff did was  change our strategy entirely Mr Baron said We were a news organization that focused on the Washingn region so our vision was constrained Jeff said from the start that wasnt the right strategy Our industry had suffered due  the internet but the internet also brought gifts and we should recognize that It made distribution free which gave us the opportunity  be a national and even international news organization and we should recognize and take advantage of thatBut Mr Bezos also seems  be a handsoff owner Although Mr Baron said they typically have a teleconference call every two weeks Mr Bezos hadnt called this week even after the Russia scoopFor many this weeks avalanche of breaking news brought back vivid memories of Nixon and Watergate All the Presidents Men and the Post reporters Woodward and Bernstein But The Posts current leadership is the first  admit that times have changed so vastly that such preinternet comparisons are largely irrelevantToday you have  be great at everything Mr Hartman said You have  be great at technology You have  be great at monetization But one thing I think were proving is that if you are great journalism can be profitableCollapse,business
Common SenseInvesrs have seemingly been oblivious  claims of Russian interference in the election the firing of a direcr of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the appointment of a special prosecur As the second quarter ends this week 2017 has so far been a banner year with major indexes hitting recordsBut as the bull market rolls on some see srm clouds on the horizon Valuations are high and its one of the longest and largest bull markets in hisry said James Stack president of InvesTech Research Bull markets dont last forever So the question is when will the music spInvesrs are on a knifes edge said Michael J Kelly global head of asset allocation for PineBridge Investments With many still scarred  the financial crisis they see a potential disaster around every cornerThis month the socalled Faang scks  Facebook Amazon Apple Netflix and ogle which have led the markets rally  faced a sudden downdraft which many market watchers called a warning of turbulent times  come Those jitters were on display Thursday as tech shares led a selloff that put a dent in the major indexesAnd then theres Mr Trump himself whose unpredictability and erratic behavior still have the potential  rattle marketsSo I asked some prominent invesrs and market analysts whether they were pulling back from scks and how they viewed these latest developmentsTheres no question that these market darlings which gether have accounted for a disproportionate percentage of the markets gains are expensive and getting more so Priceearnings ratios range from 38 Facebook  184 Amazon Their market caps are so huge they dominate the indexes They show up not only in socalled growth funds but also in value and lowvolatility funds Should they embark on a sustained plunge a bear market could quickly followThe tremor in June was a warning shot across the bow said Bill Smead the founder of Smead Capital Management in Seattle The Faang scks are showing all the classic signs of being overcooked he added What magazine hasnt had Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg on the cover Theres no question this can end very badly But the market can stay irrational for a very long time My sense is that theres one big blowout rally left in these scksMr Stack noted that the Faang scks had brief selloffs last June and Ocber only  rebound Still he said the Faang scks will be among the hardest hit in the next bear market due  the amount of money that flowed in them and the high expectations that have driven them higherBut like Mr Smead he doesnt expect that  be imminent Were not buying them but were not necessarily saying sell Mr Stack said He urged invesrs  rebalance portfolios that have become o heavily weighted in these scksEveryone I interviewed agreed that the Fed is the most likely catalyst for the next bear market but that may still be years awayHisrically its difficult  find a bear market that wasnt triggered  some extent  the Fed Mr Smead said But I dont think unwinding the long bond position as gradually as theyre going  will have a significant impact What would have an impact is if the Fed is forced  raise rates faster than everyone anticipates The Fed has prepared invesrs for one more rate hike this year Thats where the potential surprise could come If we see two or three  years end were going  see definite headwinds and maybe a market p of some significanceMr Kelly said the Fed had plenty of room  maneuver before scks start  be affected We just had a oncein70year crisis that left very long scars Businesses basically didnt invest for eight years In tightening the Fed is acknowledging that a monetary policy built on a very fragile economic backdrop is no longer appropriate But were just getting  the point now where people are crawling out of their shells and were seeing more normal economic activityMr Kelly said bull markets typically last another three  four years after such a point in the economic cycle and can even go another eight or nine Bull markets die from excess not old age he saidMr Smead agreed Theres no question were getting closer  normal rates he said That will be difficult for the sck market when it happens People will be less willing  be adventurous But thats still years awayOver at InvesTech Research were still quite bullish Mr Stack said Were not increasing cash reserves We are rebalancing wards more defensive and ouffavor secrs like consumer staples and health careThe risks dont lie with potential charges of obstruction of justice or even impeachment Mr Stack said For political mayhem  upset the economic apple cart it has  irreparably damage confidence at the consumer and business level So far we dont see that happening Consumer confidence and consumer sentiment measures are at 16year highs and CEO confidence in April was the highest since 2004Nor have invesrs given up hope that a Republican Congress will still deliver businessfriendly corporate tax reform and a progrowth overhaul of the tax code despite the presidents troublesAt the same time Trump shouldnt be looking  the market for vindication Mr Smead said I wouldnt call it a Trump rally Hes basically riding on the Obama years His botm line We dont pay much attention  politics and thats been a good thingCollapse,business
Common SenseAs Senar Ron Johnson Republican of Wisconsin put it this week Weve got  move on  tax reform so we have a competitive tax system and do it pretty quickly The House Ways and Means Committee continued hearings on tax legislation on WednesdayThe stakes couldnt be higher for Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration all anxious  demonstrate that a party that controls the White House and both houses of Congress can accomplish something significant and deliver on at least one major campaign promiseSo what would be the elements of a tax reform plan that is fair and simple and will stimulate growth  not  mention attract at least 50 Republican votes in the SenateA good place  start say many Republicans and Democrats is the Tax Reform Act of 1986 enacted under President Ronald Reagan with bipartisan supportAlmost everyone it now seems loves itPresident Reagan was willing  lead on tax reform they wrote As a result of that leadership and three years of difficult work in Congress the United States emerged with one of the most modern fair and competitive tax systems in the developed world  one that laid the foundation for decades of American job growthByron Dorgan a former Democratic senar and representative from North Dakota and a member of the House Ways and Means Committee that approved the 1986 bill wrote in The Hill this year It was widely celebrated as a major success We eliminated many deductions and special deals in the tax code used the savings  substantially lower the p tax rate  28 percent and also simplified the tax codeThe 1986 reform also achieved the elusive goal of being revenue neutral meaning it neither expanded the deficit nor entailed an overall tax increase even as it cut the p individual rate from 50 percent  28 percent The p corporate rate declined  34 percent at the time the lowest corporate rate in the developed world from 46 percent The legislation offset the loss of revenue  broadening the base  eliminating a host of deductions exemptions and credits including many abusive tax shelters It also greatly simplified returns for millions of taxpayersLegislars sold the bill  voters as a fair efficient simple spur  economic growth and it proved enormously popular one of Reagans enduring accomplishments The economy and the sck market soared But over the years much of it was undone as lobists and special interests pushed new preferences in the tax codeAs Mr Brady said this week America now has one of the most costly unfair and uncompetitive tax systems in the world The need for progrowth tax reform is urgentSo why not go back  1986 and simply resre the principle that worked so well then  lower tax rates along with a broader base that avoids increasing the deficitIt turns out that many people have tried The most recent example came in 2014 with tax reform legislation drafted  the Ways and Means Committee led at the time  Representative Dave Camp of Michigan a Republican who retired from politics in 2015 The legislation followed 30 congressional hearings dedicated  tax reform and 11 separate bipartisan tax reform working groups led  Mr Camp and Representative Sander Levin of Michigan then the ranking Democrat on the committeeThe Camp reform proposal cut rates and closed loopholes The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated it would lead  the creation of 18 million jobs and add up  34 trillion  the gross domestic product without adding  the deficit The committee estimated that the bill would save an average middleclass family of four 1300 per year in federal taxesI ok as inspiration the 1986 act Mr Camp ld me this week We adopted the same structure and approach We reduced rates and broadened the base I felt good about thatMr Camps effort drew bipartisan praise I applaud it said C Eugene Steuerle a cofounder and fellow of the UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center a key architect of the 1986 reform act and former deputy assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy While it needed a few amendments he said over all it was rigorous based on clear principles and didnt rely on magic money  avoid expanding the deficitThe Camp bill never even made it  the House floorYou cant just go back  1986 day said Michael J Graetz a professor and tax specialist at Columbia and Yale law schools who has written extensively about the 1986 act Then there were numerous tax shelters loopholes and other sources of revenue Today theres no pot of gold  pay for the cuts the way there was back in 1986 Mr Graetz saidEven though it nominally cut corporate rates the 1986 act actually shifted much of the tax burden from individuals  corporations Thats not feasible day where lowering the tax burden on corporations is a major goalThat was a reality that Mr Camp had  confront The Camp plan turned out  be a reality test Mr Graetz said There was a lot of pain in the Camp bill in terms of eliminating tax deductions and credits And that only got you  a 25 percent corporate rate President Obama used  say he could get us  28 percent also with a lot of pain But its hard  get the business community excited about 28 percent or 25 percent especially now that the UK is moving  17 percent and Canada is close  thatAnd Mr Camps plan wasnt able  lower individual rates much at all  devising three brackets taxed at 10 percent 25 percent and 35 percent But it phased out certain deductions and exemptions for people making over 400000 a year The Tax Foundation calculated that some taxpayers making more than 400000 would pay a marginal rate as high as 438 percent in effect a tax increase on the wealthy It also hit rich taxpayers  lowering the cap on mortgage deductions  500000 from 1 millionAnd the Camp plan actually raised the p effective rate on capital gains and dividends  248 percent from 238 percent according  the Tax FoundationThat was anathema  many RepublicansSome of the pain inflicted  the Camp plan also hits especially close  the Trump White House since it proposed closing some of the biggest loopholes for real estate developers Mr Camps plan eliminated the break for socalled likekind exchanges which many real estate developers use  delay or avoid capital gains taxAnd the Camp plan proposed longer depreciation schedules reducing the deductions that businesses can take for capital investment and thus increasing taxes for most real estate developers The Trump plan calls for immediate expensing of 100 percent of capital costs eliminating depreciation algether  an enormous windfall for real estate interestsIt should probably come as no surprise that one person who didnt like the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was Mr Trump One of the worst ideas in recent hisry was how he described it in a 1999 oped piece in The Wall Street JournalSuffice it  say that anything resembling the 1986 act would appear  be dead on arrival with this administration and Congress even though many tax experts support such an approachCamps approach is what responsible tax reform should look like and he garnered no support from either Republicans or Democrats Mr Graetz saidThat doesnt mean people are giving up hope Im still optimistic we can conclude tax reform this year said Mr Camp now a senior policy adviser at the tax accounting and consulting firm PwC Hes been encouraged that Trump administration officials have recently reached out  himThe issues are difficult but its not nearly as partisan as health care he said Theres been a lot of work done on tax policy over the years and I think we can build on that Most people agree theres an urgent need for tax reform and I see this as a tremendous opportunityFirst in a series of Common Sense columns about the shape a responsible tax reform plan might takeCollapse,business
Mr Sessions ld a crowd of more than 200 law enforcement officials in a hotel ballroom that he would not stand for the insubordination of California lawmakers and what he called the dangerous obstruction of federal immigration lawsA 10minute walk away in a briefing room of the State Capil v Jerry Brown unleashed a tirade against Mr Sessions and the Trump administration He said that the administration was full of liars and that Mr Sessions was basically going  war against the state of CaliforniaIt was highly unusual for an atrney general  come out here and engage in a political stunt make wild accusations many of which are based on outright lies Mr Brown added particularly a fellow coming from Alabama talking  us about secession and protecting human and civil rightsMr Sessions described the states socalled sanctuary laws as a radical maneuver that would threaten public safety and throw open the nations borders  even more illegal immigrationImmigration law is in the books and its purposes are clear and just There is no nullification there is no secession Federal law is the supreme law of the land said Mr Sessions one of the administrations most adamant immigration restrictionists He accused the state of intentionally using every power the legislature has  undermine the duly established immigration laws of AmericaThe lawsuit which the Justice Department disclosed on Tuesday in advance of Mr Sessionss speech capped a clash between the Trump administration and California that has lasted more than a year with each side reaping political profit from the battle The administration has sought  demonstrate that it will not lerate noncompliance with federal immigration enforcement Californias p officials professed leaders of the antiTrump resistance have pushed the state  cooperate with Immigration and Cusms Enforcement as little as possibleEven as Mr Sessions spoke that opposition was making itself heard Outside the hotel where Mr Sessions was speaking several hundred protesters marched holding signs saying   Jeff and Crush ICE and chanting What do we want Sessions outShortly after Mr Sessionss speech Mr Brown and the states atrney general Xavier Becerra both Democrats appeared gether in the Capil  denounce the lawsuitCalifornia is in the business of public safety Mr Becerra said We are not in the business of deportationIt targets three state laws passed in recent months one that limits state and local agencies ability  share information about criminals or suspects with federal immigration officers unless they have been convicted of serious crimes a second that prohibits local businesses from allowing ICE  examine employee records without a court order or a subpoena and a third that gave California officials more oversight over the states immigration detention centersMr Brown and Mr Becerra defended the legislation as constitutional on Wednesday saying that the laws prevented neither ICE agents from working in local jails and prisons nor employers from cooperating with ICE The employee records law Mr Becerra said simply ensures that workers and employers are guaranteed their rights and their privacy and that those are being respectedAsked whether the law would in effect require warning undocumented workers  flee ahead of an ICE visit Mr Brown compared the provision  the practice of notifying criminal suspects that they have a right  a lawyer We are just following the law and the law allows people  be advised of their rights Mr Brown said Anything else smacks of a more talitarian approach  thingsMr Sessions had another comparison in mindWhat if he asked a state enacted legislation hampering the work of employees from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or the Environmental Protection Agency Would you pass a law  do that he saidMs Schaafs actions support those who flout the law and boldly validates illegality Mr Sessions said calling her warning an embarrassment  the proud state of CaliforniaSo heres my message  Mayor Schaaf he said How dare you how dare you needlessly endanger the lives of our law enforcement officers  promote a radical open borders agendaMs Schaaf said last week that she had not publicized any information that endangered ICE officers She said she issued the warning because I know that Oakland is a city of lawabiding immigrants and families who deserve  live free from the constant threat of arrest and deportationInside the hotel ballroom on Wednesday Mr Sessions faced a polite if somewhat divided audienceSome police chiefs and sheriffs in liberalleaning areas have argued that their agencies must distance themselves from ICE  avoid scaring off immigrant residents who may be more reluctant  serve as witnesses or come forward  report crimes But there are many other officials across the country who say they would prefer  work with ICE if the legal issues surrounding such cooperation are clarified and some who are eager  help the federal government outright with immigration enforcementThose tensions were palpable at Mr Sessionss speech which was hosted  the California Peace Officers Association a law enforcement advocacy group The crowd responded  the speech with brief applause about 10 of the more than 200 officers in the room sod  clapIm stuck in the middle said Deputy Chief Derek Williams of the police department in Ontario a midsize city east of Los Angeles with a large Hispanic population Its extremely bifurcated nowWhile the new state laws do not affect his work on a dayday basis he said the sharp increase in ICE activity has fostered a lack of trust with law enforcement among immigrant residents Its a difficult time for us he saidAmong those who endorsed Mr Sessionss message was Paul R Curry a lobist for the California Correctional Supervisors Organization which represents supervisors in the state prison system He said California police chiefs were often caught between ICEs requests and the orders of their mayors who might embrace sanctuary policiesEvery police officer is sworn  uphold the law not only of the state but the nation Mr Curry said The progressive agenda is running afoul of the force of our laws in the countryThomas Fuller reported from Sacramen and Vivian Yee from New YorkCollapse,business
OpinionDont worry o much about whether Trump and the Russian leader are working gether Worry about what they have in commonSupported WASHINGTON  On June 18 2001 I attended Vladimir V Putins first meeting with the American news media We were seated at a large round table in the woodpaneled Kremlin Library It was still early in Mr Putins presidency and we werent sure what  expect of this exKGB spy fresh off the famous summit meeting where President George W Bush had gotten a sense of his soul and pronounced him trustworthy After we were kept waiting for what felt like hours Mr Putin finally arrived a little after 8 pm sat down and ok questions until nearly midnightWhen it was my turn I asked about the brutal war against separatists in the southern province of Chechnya His long answer makes for striking reading all these years later It combined mediabashing we were failing  sufficiently cover atrocities committed  the separatists he said antiIslamic sentiment What do you suggest we should do Talk with them about biblical values and the insistence that he had  attack in Chechnya  keep the rest of Russia safe As the night went on he proposed AmericanRussian operations against the real threat in the world Islamic terrorists and proclaimed his patriotic plan  resre the country after the economic reverses of the previous decadeSound familiar Mr Putins slogan back in 2001 might as well have been Make Russia Great AgainWe are four weeks in Donald J Trumps presidency and Mr Putin in power 17 years and not going anywhere anytime soon is everywhere in American politics A shirtless Mr Putin is a regular figure of parody on Saturday Night Live portrayed as a character witness or is that handler for the president of the United States His hackers meddling haunted the American general election A leaked dossier purporting  contain possible Russian blackmail material on Mr Trump dominated headlines for weeksMr Trump has made clear for months that he doesnt just admire the Russian presidents macho persona but considers him as he said during the campaign more of a leader than President Barack Obama As recently as this month in a preSuper Bowl interview on Fox Mr Trump refused  condemn Mr Putins repressive government No surprise then that Mr Trumps unseemly embrace of the Russian ugh guy has given rise  a million conspiracy theoriesBut we no longer have  speculate about conspiracies or engage in armchair psychoanalysis Since the inauguration we have accumulated some hard facts o Both Mr Trumps rheric and actions as president bear more than a passing resemblance  those of Mr Putin during his first years consolidating power Having spent those years in Moscow as a foreign correspondent  and the rest of my career as a journalist in Washingn in four previous presidencies  I can tell you the similarities are striking enough that they should not be easily dismissedOf course in personality these two are very different Mr Trump is impulsive where Mr Putin is controlled with temper tantrums and public rants contrasting with the Russians cold calculation and memorized briefing books But their oddly similar political views and approach  running their very different countries may turn out  be just as important as the Russiarelated scandals now erupting around Mr Trump You dont have  think he is some kind of agent of Russia  worry about the course hes taking us downThe mediabashing and outrageous statements The attacks on rival power centers whether stubborn federal judges or corporations refusing  get in line The warnings some of them downright panicinducing that the country is not safe  and we must go  war with Islamic extremists because they are threatening our way of life These are the techniques that Mr Putin used  great effect in his first years in power and they are very much the same tactics and clashofcivilizations ideology being deployed  Mr Trump dayDespite the evidence Kremlin watchers in the early 2000s ok a long time  see Mr Putin for the aucrat he would become At the time many people believed Russia after the turmoil of the Soviet Unions dissolution was finally headed for a few decades of stability Where some correctly saw a hardline former KGB spy determined  resre a strong state others persisted in seeing a wouldbe Westernstyle reformer Who is Mr Putin a foreign reporter famously asked early in his tenureIn retrospect the best guide  his actions should have been his statements Mr Putin did exactly what he said he would do Ive thought a lot about that over the last year as Americans have puzzled over Mr Trumps surprising rise and whether he really means all those outrageous things he says and plans  follow through with the policy shifts he promisesLike Mr Trumps Make America Great Again slogan day Mr Putins version of making Russia great again wasnt particularly ideological but its gauzy patriotic nationalism basically summed up the Putin plan for making a weakened and demoralized superpower feel better about itself Mr Putin considered the 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century and even if we Americans didnt always understand what he was up  he never deviated from his real goal consolidating authority in the KremlinMr Putins hand has clearly been much ugher Despite all the apparent reverses confusion corruption lies and economic setbacks in Russia he remains in control 17 years after his unbelievably unlikely ascent from obscure KGB lieutenant colonel  president of Russia And that o may be part of what Mr Trump another unlikely president still so insecure about his rise  the White House that he constantly brings up his election sees in Mr Putin and authoritarian rulers like him He views them as ugh guys who speak of strength more than freedom and often seem  judge their success  their own ability  stay in powerI recently asked Bob Corker the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee why he thinks Mr Trump has such apparent affinity for Mr Putin He shook his head I do think there is a degree of admiration for a strongman Im sorry he said His other theory was that Mr Trump sees himself as a sort of superhero who would forge a strong bond with Mr Putin  show he has the ability  do things that no other president has been able  doAnd this is a Republican who hopes  do business with the Trump administrationAmerica is not burdened with the hisry of tyranny and talitarianism that haunts Russia We have a 229year record of success with constitutional democracy that should long outlive the Trump era And while the trappings and powers attached  the imperial presidency Mr Trump now wields have been growing ever since the hisrian Arthur M Schlesinger Jr popularized that phrase during the Nixon era we also have robust counterbalancing institutions like a free and independent press and a federal judiciary that are already demonstrating a deep resistance  the kind of political steamroller techniques that Mr Putin deployed so effectively in RussiaStill as I report from Washingn now its hard not  worry When I moved  Moscow the year Mr Putin became president it was only a decade after the Soviet Unions collapse Many Russians still hoped their country would become more like the Western countries they had so recently been barred from even visiting For all the popularity of Mr Putins battle against what he belittled as the chaotic freedoms of the 1990s I met many people in Russia who yearned for the time when they would take their place at the table of normal stable democraciesWho would have thought that 17 years later the question is not about Russias nolongerexisting democracy but AmericasSusan B Glasser Politicos chief international affairs columnist was a

Common SenseI think the opportunities for significant tax reform are much better than anything Ive seen in years and years Senar Ron Wyden of Oregon ld me last week As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee Mr Wyden will become chairman if Democrats gain control of the Senate next week Whatever the outcome he will be a crucial participant in any bipartisan tax legislationTrumps scheming on his taxes has put a spotlight on a tale of two systems Mr Wyden said The first is compulsory You work a shift in a facry or youre a cop on a beat the taxes come out of your paycheck Thats just how it worksFor the most fortunate he added you hire a battery of experts and you pay what you want when you want  or even nothing at all I think we can all agree the tax code is a dysfunctional messKevin Brady Republican of Texas and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee which writes tax laws ld me much the same thing While he didnt want  comment on Mr Trump and his taxes he said Americans are sick of this broken tax code Its so complex Most people view it as unfair Theyre ready for someone  lead on tax reform and make it fairer and simplerDemocrats havent issued a similarly sweeping proposal but in some surprising ways the Republican plan isnt all that different from earlier reform plans championed  Mr Wyden and other centrist DemocratsHouse Republicans would reduce the number of tax brackets  three 33 percent on the highest incomes 25 percent for the middle range and 12 percent on more modest incomes The p rate day is just over 39 percentThe plan wipes out most itemized deductions including those for state and local taxes and interest expenses while preserving some yetbedetermined form of deductions for charitable contributions and home mortgages It taxes capital gains interest and dividends at half the rate of ordinary income It eliminates the reviled alternative minimum tax which falls primarily on the upper middle classIn essence the proposal would move the United States away from a traditional income tax and more ward a consumption tax which is intended  encourage savings and investmentSuch an approach inevitably favors the rich since they own most financial assets and do most of the investing The centrist UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center estimates that threequarters of the tax cuts would benefit the p 1 percent of taxpayers and that the highest 01 percent would get an average tax cut of 13 millionMoreover House Republicans would abolish the estate tax which falls almost exclusively on the wealthySo how would that square with Mrs Clinns call  require the rich  pay a greater share of the tax burdenFor one thing both Democrats and Republicans want  do something  fix the much criticized corporate tax code and would like  produce an immediate revenue windfall  luring back profits now held abroad  American corporationsThe House Republicans plan cuts the corporate tax rate  20 percent from the current 35 percent It taxes socalled passthrough income from small businesses partnerships and limited liability companies at a flat 25 percent as opposed  the current p ordinary income rate of 396 percentIt allows immediate deductions for most business expenses and investments eliminating the need for complicated depreciation schedules and does away with the interest deductionWhat impact all this would have on the federal deficit is a matter of continuing debate since it depends on how much these changes would spur additional economic growthThe conservativeleaning Tax Foundation estimates that assuming no additional growth the plan would cost 24 trillion over its first decade But it also projects the plan would stimulate the economy generating more tax revenue and cutting the cost  a relatively modest 191 billion over 10 yearsThe Tax Policy Center estimated a higher cost of 31 trillion over the first decade Adjusting for expected growth reduces the cost only slightly  3 trillion largely because of higher interest payments on the debt needed  cover the larger deficitIn my view the preeminent problem facing the United States is low economic growth now pegged at about 2 percent Mr HoltzEakin said To grow more rapidly over the long term people need  save and invest those savings This approach supports saving and investmentLeonard E Burman direcr of the Tax Policy Center and a professor at the Syracuse University Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs agreed that the plan is clearly designed  encourage investment especially the provision allowing businesses  immediately deduct expensesEven Hillary Clinn has proposed that for small businesses Mr Burman ld me The primary drawback as weve modeled it is that it would add trillions  the national debt over 10 yearsStill this is genuine reform he added which is exactly the kind of thing we should be debating in a national election and something the public should be decidingIf Mrs Clinn is elected president the Republican plan as written would be dead on arrival because it runs squarely in one of her main campaign themes The rich arent paying their fair share But some tax experts say the Republican plan could be adjusted  include higher rates for the Americans who earn the mostIn theory it would make it easier  raise the p rates Mr HoltzEakin said Thats the fear of some conservativesRaising some of the rates could achieve many of Mrs Clinns goals including increasing taxes on the highest earners and creating an overall increase in revenue while still embracing the underlying simplicity and progrowth philosophy of the House Republicans planA compromise plan might raise rates for taxpayers earning more than 5 million as Mrs Clinn has proposed limit the exclusion on capital gains interest and dividends cut the corporate rate  25 percent rather than 20 percent and keep the estate tax for the wealthiest taxpayersMr Wydens last stab at bipartisan tax reform the WydenCoats plan of 2011 which he and Senar Dan Coats Republican of Indiana sponsored had many of those elements Like the Republican House plan it called for just three brackets and lower rates a p rate of 35 percent only modestly higher than the House Republicans 33 percent It allowed taxpayers  exclude 35 percent of their capital gains as opposed  the Republicans 50 percent It lowered the corporate tax rate  24 percent and eliminated the alternative minimum taxTodays bitterly polarized political environment of course makes any compromise extremely difficult Tea Party Republicans are unlikely  support any legislation that raises rates or revenue The Democratic left is likely  balk at cuts  capital gains and corporate taxes and more breaks for business investmentBut both Mr Wyden and Mr Brady ld me they were open  dealmaking no matter how Tuesdays election turns outPeople recognize that the tax code has been hijacked  powerful interests and both sides see this is so wildly inefficient Mr Wyden said If I have the opportunity  chair the Senate Finance Committee Id like  come out of the gate on Day 1 with something that would be well received as bipartisan It would be malpractice not  do thisMr Brady said the Republican proposals werent etched in sne Were in a very aggressive listening and outreach mode looking for feedback from families and job crears he saidWere going  work with the next president  fix this broken tax code he said At the end of the day we know from the Reaganera tax reform that if were going  simplify the tax code and grow the economy it will require bipartisan support regardless of who is in the White HouseCollapse,business

Common SensePayScale introduced its first college salary report in 2008 and the College Scorecard from the federal government followed last year ushering an elephant in the hallowed halls of college admissions What do the schools graduates actually earnDespite the handwringing of many in academia who saw the immeasurable richness of a college education crassly reduced  a dollar sign the data has wrought a sea change in the way students and families evaluate prospective colleges Earnings data are finding their way in a proliferating number of mainstream college rankings shifting the competitive landscape of American higher education in often surprising waysForty percent of their result is measures of outcomes  earnings graduation rate and loan repayment rate The other 60 percent rates the schools resources student engagement as measured  student responses  a questionnaire and learning environment or diversityBoth Forbes and Money magazines in their rankings incorporate PayScale data on earningsThere are now so many rankings that Well soon be ranking the rankings said Andrew Delbanco a professor of American studies at Columbia University and author of College What It Was Is and Should BeRankings drive presidents and trustees in frenzies of delight or alarm he said Meanwhile most institutions that serve most students  underfunded public colleges especially community colleges  arent even on the screenOne thing is clear None of the rankings agree on which is the best college The only school that shows up among the p 10 on the Wall Street Journal Economist Georgewn PayScale and US News lists is Harvard But it ranks No 1 on only one of Georgewns lists earnings adjusted for choice of majorThe number of rankings is a good thing Students and their parents certainly shouldnt rely on only one sourceWeve been very clear that this is a guide for figuring how much you should spend on your education said Katie Bardaro vice president for data analytics at PayScale In choosing college you need  make a smart financial decision Whats the likely return on your investmentIs it the only facr she added Absolutely not But its an important facrStanford University is No 1 on the recent Wall Street Journal list It fares well on PayScale and US News o But it falls  a distant No 256 on The Economists list which it should be said produced the results most at odds with other rankingsResults diverged even more widely for smaller schools This years winner on PayScale is the SUNY Maritime College whose graduates earn a median 147000 The school at Fort Schuyler in the Bronx enrolls fewer than 2000 students and it offers bachelors degrees in engineering and science But it only ties for 80th in US Newss regional universities north category and isnt even ranked  The Wall Street JournalOr consider a venerable liberal arts college like Washingn and Lee in Virginia Its No 1 on The Economists list Its graduates earn a whopping 22375 more than would have been expected based on the characteristics of entering students the magazine calculated But it ranks only 109th on the Wall Street JournalTimes Higher Education list with an especially low score for diversityWomens colleges are especially vulnerable when earnings data are incorporated US News ranks Wellesley College Hillary Clinns alma mater No 3 among national liberal arts colleges It falls  No 30 on The Wall Street Journals rankings and  No 201 on PayScaleYale illustrates an even starker divergence It is No 1 for outcomes in The Journals ranking in The Economists its near the botm at 1270 The magazine estimates that a student attending Yale would earn about 10000 a year less on average than if the student had attended another collegeTo show how sensitive the results are  the criteria used in the rankings I asked PayScale  rank schools based on earnings but also with relatively few majors in the highpaying science fields and whose graduates reported a high level of meaning in their workThat resulted in an entirely different list The p five in order were Claremont McKenna in California Georgewn Wesleyan Holy Cross and Oberlin Liberal arts colleges  whose leaders have been some of the most vocal critics of rankings  generally fared much better using criteria that included job satisfaction Im a graduate and trustee of DePauw University a liberal arts collegeBut does the proliferation of data  and rankings  actually help students and parents make wiser choices Whats clear is that rankings sell said Richard Ekman president of the Council of Independent Colleges Its not at all clear that leads  a betterinformed public Theres so much information its hard for any high school student  sort it outJeff Strohl direcr of research at the Georgewn Center on Education and the Workforce said When I was 17 I wouldnt have known what  make of all the data But Georgewns goal is  help students interpret it We need  move the needle from just presenting the earnings numbers  helping them make a decision based on that We need  think about this using a public service model he saidIf nothing else earnings are objective and as the database grows in the millions reliable And theyve helped focus attention on littleknown schools that would never crack the high status barrier of the US News rankings especially the community colleges that educate the vast majority of Americas studentsIn addition  SUNY Maritime I found myself looking up some schools Id never heard of that fared well on the earningsbased rankings Bentley University Massachusetts which made both The Economists and Georgewns p 10 lists Otis College of Art and Design California and Alderson Broaddus University West Virginia both in The Economists p 10 and University of the Pacific California and Molloy College New York both in Georgewns p 10In the end of course deciding which college  attend is intensely personal No ranking can assess a students unique personality goals strengths and weaknesses and match those  the right collegeSo how would I rank the rankings Other than its ability  confer bragging rights which seems a dubious distinction among already statuscrazed students and parents US News seems in danger of becoming an anachronism as long as it ignores outcomesIt should go without saying that the value of an education should never be reduced  purely monetary terms But college is a major investment students and parents should consult PayScale and the College Scorecard in order  understand the financial implications of their decisionsNo ranking is perfect but I found that The Wall Street JournalTimes Higher Education survey did a creditable job blending a wide variety of facrs including outcomes and student engagementAs Phil Baty rankings edir at Times Higher Education ld me this week The success of a college graduate should not be measured purely in terms of the salaries they earn Theres more  life than a high salary This is why weve also put an emphasis on how much the student is intellectually engaged stimulated and stretched  their college educationCollapse,business
